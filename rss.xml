Founded in 2011, they saw an opportunity to connect the software we use every day to streamline workflows more effectively. With Zapier, apps like Salesforce, Intuit, Google, and Dropbox can integrate to move data between them automatically, freeing up time for users to focus on impactful work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of UX Research Roy Olende shares how Zapier’s internationally scattered teams approach research, as well as why Dovetail has been a game-changer in centralizing customer data, connecting their customer-obsessed teams, and maximizing efficiency through insights that anyone can access—from new starters to leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeping hundreds of hours of data accessible in one centralized insights hub&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Zapier, research has always been a priority. It’s how they’ve continuously listened and learned from customers how to build and ship the best automation tools out there. Because of this, the team has amassed hundreds of hours of invaluable customer interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using Dovetail, Zapier housed this wealth of information across multiple platforms. So valuable insights existed in silos, blocking meaningful analysis and collaboration across teams. As the Zapier team scaled, jumping between these platforms to find research processes and guides, along with previously discovered insights, became a challenge. What’s more, data was hard or impossible to find. For a company that valued automation and efficiency, it was clear that something needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the adoption of Dovetail, the research team was able to quickly import and organize research insights in one centralized hub. Now, the team conducts their research confidently, easily finds data from months or years prior, and can resurface invaluable insights to make better product decisions—faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connecting a customer-centric and intrinsically curious workforce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an organization, Zapier is all about connecting and integrating software. And their culture is no exception—being 100% fully remote with teammates spanning 40 countries around the world, the team at Zapier relies on intuitive tools to help them make well-informed product decisions backed by customer data. Dovetail, as a centralized insights hub, is now an epicenter of invaluable data, enabling access and fostering collaboration across continents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they’re a product manager, CSM, designer, engineer, or executive leader, Dovetail empowers everyone at Zapier to make more informed product decisions together. By democratizing research and empowering anyone at Zapier to get closer to their customers, Dovetail helps dozens of teams collaborate seamlessly across the globe. Whether a senior leader is staying close to the customer through watching a Dovetail highlight reel or a new starter is being onboarded and hearing product feedback for the first time, Dovetail brings research to  Zapier team members wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combatting mental overload with simplified insights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a completely remote company,  Zapier team members are used to collaborating on and sharing information through documents, which can make it hard to process and retain everything without losing sight of what’s important. Tools like Dovetail that consolidate and organize data into digestible insights help reduce the stress Roy and his team experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centralizing insights in one accessible platform has given Zapier teams tens of hours back weekly to focus on what really matters, rather than digging for customer data or doubling up on research. With accessible data that won’t get lost or buried, Zapier has accelerated learning and product development, which ultimately leads to decisions that delight their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intrepid restructured their insights and are involving more team in Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/intrepid</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/intrepid</guid><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrepid Group’s mission is to “Change the Way People See the World”. Their range of B2C and B2B brands like Intrepid Travel, Adventure Tours Australia, and Peregrine cater for all ages, budgets and appetites for adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, they’ve been building up their user experience and research muscle. Gemma Sherwood, Intrepid Group’s UX Manager told us that the company is now focusing on “better understanding our customers so that we could provide them with the best travel experience possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This focus is reflected in stats from their recent annual report. In one year alone, Gemma and her team collected and analyzed more than 50,000 pieces of feedback from customers around their overall experience, and throughout their entire customer journey. They grew their UX team by 250% and run 88 individual usability testing sessions on three continents, resulting in 368 videos and 3,000 minutes of footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many companies today, the growth of Intrepid Group’s UX team shows no sign of slowing down. Gemma’s planning to double her team again in the next couple of months, adding team members across three time zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our growth means we’re going to face new challenges of scale, in terms of practice alignment, sharing insights, speed and information management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/static/769accfaec1e6b7eaa7f668459d817ac/cbe2c/4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cluny McCullagh, a lead researcher at Intrepid Group, says the primary challenge is finding a place to centralize raw research and insights from across the company, and the globe. “We maintain good speed when synthesizing research, and we deliver insights to different stakeholders through presentations, videos, and digital whiteboards”, Cluny explains. “However, when stakeholders miss a session or don’t have access to a digital whiteboard, we’re often forced to trawl back through research outcomes to provide information”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central, searchable repository to address most enquiries is our goal to fix this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and design at Intrepid Group are configured in a hybrid model, with centralized researchers and embedded designers. Once a project is prioritized, researchers engage stakeholders for generative research activities, and then onboard the designers and project team with results and opportunities during sprint zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Dovetail helps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail has proved exceptional in aiding researchers to return to raw data and ideas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UX team at Intrepid Group are early in their adoption of Dovetail, but they’re already seeing value. Dovetail has helped researchers create a hierarchy of qualitative research results which is starting to guide the structure of their insights in other locations. Now, more people are getting involved to improve their decision-making based on information in the searchable research repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, researchers set up Dovetail with the goal of it acting as a repository for their research, which meant only their immediate team had access. Now, the rest of the UX team—including UI, UX, and visual designers—are learning to refer to data in Dovetail when they have a question outside the existing research for their project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With researchers and designers onboard, and the research repository growing, Gemma says the UX team have turned their attention to other departments like Marketing and Insights, with the goal to get them involved by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our broader goal is for the Insights and Marketing departments to utilize Dovetail as a searchable research library to improve their decisions and ground them in customer experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vero brings the customer to their global team]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/vero</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/vero</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The globally-dispersed Vero team is small but mighty, with a presence in Australia, the United States, and Europe. They’re committed to building fundamental business software that makes the lives of marketing teams easier. The Vero team uses Dovetail to help streamline their research process and get closer to their customers. Read on to learn how Dovetail fits into their ecosystem and why it’s contributed to next-level product design and “groundbreaking” results for Vero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer closeness for a globally dispersed team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Vero provides innovative software for modern marketing tech stacks, the team is constantly reiterating to keep ahead of the software curve and provide the best service possible for their customers. Vero doesn’t have a dedicated research function but, rather, encourages all of its employees to get closer to their customers and learn from their feedback. From designers to support and success teams at Vero, everyone is hopping on customer calls and conducting research to make better product design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After introducing Dovetail, the Vero team can easily manage their data in one platform, which means they can learn from each other’s research findings and truly democratize research across the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The single, centralized repository Dovetail provides makes accessing research far more convenient than switching between multiple platforms. Previously, customer call notes would live siloed in one person’s drive. Now, the entire company has a place to discover and review their teammates’ findings, draw themes, and get a deeper understanding of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Streamlining and immortalizing the research process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Dovetail, the team at Vero conducted research on an ad-hoc basis. While research has always been prioritized, Dovetail has streamlined the research process, making it faster and more efficient for anyone at Vero to hop in and get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Vero team conducts anywhere from three to eight customer calls a week, uploads them to Dovetail, transcribes, and then assesses their research findings. Their goal is to have every customer call in Dovetail. Whether it’s in sales, product design, support, success, or anything in between, every team member at Vero is encouraged to house their data in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with uploading customer calls and transcribing them in Dovetail, the Vero team also makes use of the platform’s features, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/highlight-and-tag-project-content/&quot;&gt;highlights&lt;/a&gt;, to tag important notes. A single word, sentence, or entire paragraph can be tagged, which allows users to be more granular with themes and highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vero team also summarizes and shares their research findings using &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-findings-insights/&quot;&gt;insights&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than sitting through an entire customer call recording or talking about their research data secondhand, Vero employees can show a summary of their project that might include relevant evidence like notes, tags, quotes, and media. Introducing a platform with this kind of capability means that anyone can quickly find relevant data to help provide more context and a deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using Dovetail for onboarding and teaching &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond customer research, the team at Vero also uses Dovetail in their onboarding flow for any customer-facing roles. In this way, Dovetail is a tool to illustrate what best practice looks like when it comes to customer interviews. New starters have the opportunity to explore a wide range of research data to get them up to speed and can pick up on details like conversation flow, probing questions, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since content in Dovetail stays in there as long as you want it to, anyone at Vero can find and revisit research findings to gain all the context they need to make important product design decisions. Beyond product, however, the Vero team also makes use of Dovetail to come back to re-familiarize themselves on something like customer feedback or sales call. Because Dovetail has search capabilities, the Vero team can quickly find key takeaways within any given transcription before they make any big decisions, which means they’re providing the best experience possible for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uniqa conducts five times more customer research using Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/uniqa</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/uniqa</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Uniqa Insurance Group is a European insurance provider operating in 18 countries, with the largest market share in Austria, where the company was born, and where the group level administration is based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniqa strives to reach beyond insurance products and facilitate “feelings of joy” in their customers’ lives. This is reflected in their brand mission of “Sicher, besser, länger leben” or “Safer, better, longer life”. To continue this vision, their strategic goal is to branch out and become a service provider in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Uniqa Group established the Digitalisation &amp;amp; Innovation department, and within it Team Digital. Although Team Digital exists at the Group level, separate from Uniqa Austria, the three feature teams that form the bulk of it are responsible for the development of almost all of the digital channels for the Austrian market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll find Team CX (Customer Experience) within Team Digital. This team is comprised of front-end developers, designers, and one user researchers, Sonja Bobrowska. While Sonja is the only user researcher on the team, she’s proud of the fact that it “an insurance company in Austria has a full-time customer experience researcher on staff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team CX works in close collaboration with product owners in each feature team within Team Digital, as well as with other departments at Uniqa Austria. The team practice an agile way of working, while the rest of the company follows a more waterfall-like approach, which naturally creates a big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While an appreciation of user research has been growing in other departments, in practice, it is difficult to expect product owners across the organization to know exactly when and how development work might benefit from a user research study that can support them with the necessary data to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although customer-centricity is well-recognised as an idea within the company, there is still resistance towards finding out how we really treat our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To try and solve this, Sonja and Team CX have significantly increased the pace at which they conduct usability tests. This has been fairly straightforward to accomplish because the capabilities to be tested limit the scope of the study clearly. On the other hand, Uniqa sells dozens of insurance products so the plethora of customer situations and internal processes the team could investigate is vast, and scoping ethnographic studies is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, between March and December, we conducted three qualitative studies. In 2018 this number has risen to 16, which represents a 5-fold increase over the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to building awareness of user research and running many more usability tests than before, Sonja and her team also have a big challenge recruiting participants for insurance-related studies. Sonja explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insurance is a topic that occupies people rarely and then, at critical or negative moments. Until now, we conducted recruiting in an internal panel we’d built by inviting Uniqa newsletter subscribers. This reduced the pool of participants who were long-term (and therefore, older) Uniqa customers, or even fans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d taken this way to make sure that we abide by the recently introduced GDPR rules. Now that our legal departments gained a clearer understanding of the laws, we received permission to conduct intercept recruiting, for example, right after a customer submitted a claim submission form online.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will phase out the panel and instead rely on recruiting through external agencies with large panels, and by intercepting our own customers directly at the moments of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Team Digital operates in a bilingual German-English environment which introduces problems when sharing research insights with all stakeholders. Often, reports must be duplicated to accommodate non-native speakers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Dovetail helps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonja and her team use Dovetail as a storage, analysis and synthesis tool for qualitative user research data. The data originates from two sources – ethnographic interviews and usability tests, where a colleague will write non-verbatim transcriptions in notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case of usability tests, Team CX record sessions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.io/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt; where note-takers add comments to specific sections to highlight usability issues (Sonja also sometimes makes short video highlights in Lookback). These comments are then copied to Dovetail as notes. Sonja explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In both cases, I first read all notes in Dovetail to get a feeling for patterns. Then, I start tagging highlights with simple keywords such as parts of the process or interface. This is usually an iterative step whereby I often adjust the tags to better reflect and capture the differences in meaning. While I’m about to finish tagging notes I also start reflecting on the insights we can gain from the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, Sonja will send out the summary to designers and product owners as an email, with links to source material. She also creates presentations for management and for non-design, non-technical stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail has dramatically improved the way we store, analyse and synthesise qualitative research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sonja and Team CX, Dovetail has replaced the ineffective way of storing “spreadsheets upon spreadsheets in folders upon folders” on a common team drive. Sonja finds tagging textual data more intuitive in Dovetail than breaking data down into columns or cells in a spreadsheet. “That is also why we looked for a different tool to Airtable, which we tried before Dovetail.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scanning tags and building insights out of tagged data is much more seamless in Dovetail. It also makes them accessible at any time from anywhere, unlike photos of post-its, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dovetail is primarily used by Sonja, their team manager uses Dovetail to get a quantifiable overview of the projects they have completed. Designers and product owners will also log in to Dovetail unprompted to find answers for specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, email and slides are still the way Sonja needs to communicate research insights because they are the most widespread and accessible communication methods at the company, however, with all the features that are planned on the roadmap, she thinks that Dovetail will be able to eventually replace them and become the one source for qualitative customer insights at Uniqa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[HealthMatch personalizes product experiences with Dovetail insights]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/healthmatch</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/healthmatch</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;HealthMatch is on a mission to accelerate medical research, allowing for faster and more efficient access to life-changing medication. Through technology that puts the control back in the hands of the patient, HealthMatch’s goal is to make the process of finding and accessing clinical trials as simple as possible—for everyone. With an empathetic approach to giving their customers the best experience possible, there is very little the HealthMatch team does &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; conducting research first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to discover how Joel Pinkham, VP of Growth and Strategic Projects, and his team execute their research and how Dovetail helps in building trust with their customers, centralizing their data in one place, and showing rather than telling invaluable research findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building relationships and trust through customer closeness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As VP of Growth and Strategic Projects, Joel knows that getting close to customers is incredibly important, so he incorporated research questions into the customer onboarding process. This means that Joel has the opportunity to speak directly to customers from the beginning of their journey with HealthMatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because HealthMatch works with patients who are candidates for clinical trials, building relationships is incredibly important. The team truly puts their customers’ health and comfort first, whether they’re speaking to them about their trials, medical history, or in Joel’s case, talking about their experience with the HealthMatch product to improve their UX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do my best work without connecting with and really understanding my customers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel Pinkham, VP of Growth and Strategic Projects HealthMatch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making technology to connect patients to clinical research is specialized. It requires the HealthMatch team to learn a lot about how the industry works; it has to be at the core of what they do to make sure they don’t get something crucial wrong. To execute on this, Joel’s approach to research is hands-on and informal, which allows him to meet his customers where they are. Joel really makes a point to get to know his customers and build trust organically through conversations with empathy at the heart of everything he does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One singular platform to host, assess, and make sense of data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HealthMatch’s users are primarily located on the US East Coast, while the company is headquartered in Australia, so most of their customer calls happen at either 6:00 AM or 11:00 PM local time. Being up early or late and always doing interviews independently meant that before introducing Dovetail, it was a challenge to take in all the information without jotting down notes the whole time. Instead of taking notes, the HealthMatch team would much rather remain present and ask thoughtful, probing questions throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dovetail supports me primarily when I’m on customer calls. Since I trust the platform to house, transcribe, and pull out important bits of information, I have the freedom to remain fully connected and present on my customer calls. I don’t need to rely on anyone else to take notes, which is hugely valuable.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel Pinkham, VP of Growth and Strategic Projects, HealthMatch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel also saves a lot of time with Dovetail. Rather than hopping around different platforms trying to locate various research notes and collect important data, he can easily find it and quickly share it with relevant stakeholders on the fly. And on the flip side, he’s not wasting HealthMatch engineers’ time by over-explaining his case or sharing irrelevant findings about the project. They can watch the key takeaways for themselves without having to hunt for the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Show rather than talk about important research findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail helps Joel show rather than tell the important research he’s gathered for HealthMatch’s stakeholders. Getting exposure to customer feedback also means that more and more teams at HealthMatch are getting closer to their customers, which enables them to build better products and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail added a lot of value to HealthMatch’s sessions that focus on a problem and rough solution of what the team is building in their product. This includes the product team and engineers that are working on that specific feature. In these sessions, Joel can really easily and quickly find an interview, bring up the tags, and play that 20-second clip straight from the customer. This helps to provide all the context the team needs to make product decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work in the healthcare industry, we&amp;#39;re excited to share that Dovetail is &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/health-is-wealth-were-hipaa-ready/&quot;&gt;HIPAA ready&lt;/a&gt;.

Being customer-obsessed is in Atlassian’s DNA. Since it was founded in 2002, the company has put the customer front and center of every product they’ve built. To support this obsession, everyone at Atlassian is encouraged to get closer to their customers. With the Atlassian research teams leading from the front, everyone can use Dovetail to do customer research at scale. A single research hub helps connect global teams and makes it easier for everyone at Atlassian to make better decisions for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke to five Atlassian researchers across different areas of the business about their approach to research. They shared how they continuously innovate their processes to stay at the leading edge of customer research, and how Dovetail plays a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Simply put, Dovetail enables collaborative work. It also gives us the opportunity to use, analyze, and re-use data to pull together stories, which is time-saving and really valuable.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie, Lead Researcher, Sydney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Global teams championing customer closeness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a challenge for any large, globally distributed team to prioritize getting closer to their customers. But Atlassian researchers make it look easy. Every day, from Australia to America, India to the Netherlands, and everywhere in between, Atlassian researchers carve out time with their customers—jumping on calls and hearing their feedback first-hand. To store their data, make sense of it, and pull out findings that can add value time and time again, they use Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers like Joyce, Cara, Natalie, and Sarah are constantly juggling multiple projects at once. They don’t just collect customer data—they uncover insights that empower different teams within Atlassian to understand their customers at a deeper level, with the ultimate goal being more-informed product decisions. Atlassian trusts Dovetail to support a wide range of research data, meaning qualitative and quantitative data can be stored, organized, and examined. This works for Atlassian, where research is diverse and in-depth, and draws on multiple different frameworks and approaches inspired by, among others, Jared Spool’s &lt;i&gt;Exposure Hours&lt;/i&gt;, the grounded theory approach, and BJ Fogg’s &lt;i&gt;Behavior Change Framework&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Dovetail gives me the flexibility to engage people in research with varying degrees of depth, whether it’s an insight ‘snack’ or a full-blown report and presentation. Everyone has differing amounts of time they’re willing and able to give to research, and Dovetail enables me to meet people where they are.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joyce, Senior UX Researcher, San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from accommodating a range of approaches and philosophies, Dovetail also meets researchers where they are. This means they can stay high-level or go as granular as they like when it comes to exploring research. Atlassian researchers like Joyce find a lot of value in this flexibility. In the past, she and her team would often ask colleagues to join hour-long sessions when only ten or fifteen minutes would be directly relevant to what they were working on. With Dovetail, Joyce can easily share the key takeaways from her customer interviews without taking up unnecessary time. They can also watch recordings and highlight reels if they aren’t able to join live because of their time zone or schedules. This has helped streamline their continuous and collaborative research approach, where no one misses out on the opportunity to understand their customer better, regardless of their location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Before using Dovetail, our teams lacked a central place to view, share, and make sense of their research data. In the past, researchers at Atlassian managed and tracked their own data independently. This meant that certain teams were missing out on invaluable insights to help us get closer to their research and, ultimately, our customers.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie, Lead Researcher, Sydney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;One place for Atlassian research teams to stay close to— and make sense of— their data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlassian practices a “team anywhere” approach, meaning their 8,000+ employees are empowered to work wherever they do their best work. Since their teams are scattered around the globe, staying connected to their team is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single platform to house research data and customer insights is the ideal solution for distributed teams like those at Atlassian. Regardless of which product or project an Atlassian team member is working on, they can jump into Dovetail to catch up on previous research, understand key themes, and draw connections across different data points. Rather than jumping around a patchwork of tools to find customer data, the team at Atlassian knows that it &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;exists in Dovetail, whether it be customer feedback from five years ago, five months ago, or five minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlassian researchers have created a highly sophisticated and data-rich approach to research. It often involves cross-disciplinary collaboration, which enables different skill sets to combine and come to a more powerful conclusion. Having a platform like Dovetail that supports their complex research goals rather than slowing them down is a game-changer. As Natalie explains, research is like a team sport since it can be highly collaborative. It helps to keep everyone involved with the research as it’s happening, but it can also be reviewed and revisited time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Research as a sport means that you’re building this knowledge together, with other researchers, which has endurance and resilience. It takes discipline on the researcher&amp;#39;s part to keep connected to this knowledge and apply it accordingly.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie, Lead Researcher, Sydney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/highlights-table/&quot;&gt;highlighting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/three-features-quick-accurate-tagging/&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt; make it easy for the Atlassian team to identify and track patterns that emerge across their research data. According to Cara,&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-findings-insights/&quot;&gt; insights&lt;/a&gt; are also used regularly to collaborate with teammates and provide a holistic view of important findings. “They help us understand the impact of our research, hosting evidence directly all within a digestible, engaging report.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making better product decisions through d&lt;b&gt;emocratized research &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just researchers who get to speak to customers. Everyone at Atlassian is encouraged to spend a few hours each week diving into raw customer research and insights within Dovetail. This initiative, known internally as &lt;i&gt;Exposure Hours, &lt;/i&gt;gives everyone the chance to build more context and gain a deeper understanding of exactly who they’re building products for. &lt;i&gt;Exposure Hours&lt;/i&gt; not only gives every team member the opportunity to hear customer feedback firsthand, but it&amp;#39;s also a powerful onboarding tool for someone doing research for the first time at Atlassian— or ever. Natalie explains, “regardless of experience, a new Atlassian researcher has access to a wide range of research data from seasoned pros who have been conducting customer interviews for years, to highly specialized researchers for specific findings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Whenever I share customer videos, I inevitably hear back from a designer or engineer saying how illuminating it is, or how much more something makes sense to them. I love that I can easily extract a reel of customer interviews on the same theme to share with the team or create a collection of highlights in a story for stakeholders to self-serve.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah, Lead Researcher, Melbourne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlassian’s &lt;i&gt;Exposure Hours&lt;/i&gt; are attended by a good mix of engineers, designers, and product managers, according to Sarah, a Lead Researcher based in Melbourne. While certain data is protected, the right people can access the “full picture”. Natalie explains that research is often distilled into recommendations, but if someone wants to understand the ‘why’ behind them, they can jump into Dovetail and gain context by watching a few interviews. Since everyone can access Dovetail, research has greater visibility and can influence more decisions and drive more value across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;b&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing like actually seeing how someone uses your product to get an understanding of what it is that they&amp;#39;re trying to do, what troubles they might be having.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie, Lead Researcher, Sydney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As innovators in the research space, Atlassian is ahead of the curve by already having an established culture of continuous research and customer closeness. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.co/resources/continuous-research-report/#continuous-research-practice&quot;&gt;Maze’s Trends to Watch Research report in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, user insights are the leading driver of innovation. Looking ahead to the future of research at Atlassian, the company has no intention of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I’m pretty jazzed about some new segmentation work the quant team has started working on. I’ll be looking forward to bringing those findings into the architecture of our repository in Dovetail so we can more closely inspect data through that lens.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah, Lead Researcher, Melbourne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail helps Canva empower the world to design, one customer insight at a time]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/canva</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/canva</guid><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment they launched in 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canva.com/&quot;&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt; has been on a mission to empower the world to design anything and publish anywhere.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;The global visual communications platform enables individuals and teams to design, work, share, and collaborate on everything from presentations to social media graphics to video and print products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Design research at Canva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even successful products require generative or foundational research to unlock new innovation opportunities—and Canva is no exception. With a crazy big goal like ”empowering the world to design,” Canva is constantly exploring the roadblocks to empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canva’s researchers are embedded in product teams. They prioritize projects based on the company’s strategy, where the most significant knowledge gaps are, and where they see the biggest opportunities to improve the user experience. Researchers plan, conduct, and analyze research, bringing their team along for the journey and helping them to get closer to the users and their world. They then share their findings, run workshops, provide recommendations, and help teams incorporate insights into their roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While customer obsession and usability testing have been part of Canva’s DNA from the beginning, their dedicated Design Research team is relatively new. Design researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/uxbeckywhite/&quot;&gt;Becky White&lt;/a&gt; joined in early 2020 and has helped grow the team to seven (and counting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canva.com/careers/design/&quot;&gt;check out their open roles here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canva is a fast-paced, hyper-growth company. Before a dedicated research team existed, designers and PMs would conduct ad-hoc research, like customer interviews, on their own. They’d focus on getting information and making decisions from the insights, but not much thought went towards where video recordings, transcripts, and findings reports lived afterward. This made it challenging to track down previous research or understand where findings had come from. New starters struggled with discovering past research and often found out about previous research reports through word-of-mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Canva’s research repository&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big reason for Canva’s pull to Dovetail was the promise of a central research repository. Dovetail was one of the first tools that Becky set up. Now, researchers and other product team members store their moderated research recordings and transcripts in Dovetail and use it to create transcriptions quickly, start to tag their data, find emerging themes, and analyze data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having this repository helps new and existing Canvanauts quickly get up to speed on previous projects or topics of interest. They can re-watch full research sessions or simply conduct searches for terms of interest. For example, PMs can review quotes from users about topics like &lt;i&gt;creativity, templates&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;collaboration&lt;/i&gt;. New designers can watch usability sessions to see where users are struggling with existing flows. Even content designers use Dovetail to get an immediate picture of user sentiment around messaging and copy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this can easily be done by Canvanauts on their own, without the aid of a researcher.  For a global, fast-paced team, that level of accessibility and flexibility is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Power of video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Becky, the research team finds video clips extremely powerful when presenting their findings; far more effective than reading a quote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to see a user’s face, hear their voice, and sense their emotion when they’re talking—is incomparable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos are so loved in the Canva product team that the researchers often won’t wait until the final report to share great video clips. If the product team wasn’t able to observe the session, they send a Dovetail link to the clip via Slack. This enables everyone to get on the same page and have a great discussion about the product implications and opportunities in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Democratizing research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky and her team are excited to nurture a research culture at Canva, but they can’t conduct all the research themselves since they’re still a small team. So, part of a researcher’s role at Canva is empowering other people to conduct quality research. They hold office hours, have created templates and guides, and conduct training on research best practices. Whenever designers and product managers conduct interviews, the research team recommends using Dovetail to transcribe and store sessions. They are then able to tag quotes, analyze data, and identify prominent themes before reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever designers and product managers conduct research, the researchers recommend using Dovetail to transcribe their sessions and analyze findings. Breaking quotes and observations down into this level of granularity, then re-combining them to identify themes is often something non-researchers haven’t done before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially for non-researchers, Dovetail makes getting started with research analysis more approachable and even fun. Product teams can analyze in whichever way is best for them and their study. When they start to see those emerging themes and insights from the data: that’s the real power of Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hear Me Out translates qualitative data into quantitive insights with Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/hear-me-out</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/hear-me-out</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hear Me Out talks to employees one-on-one, confidentially, about their experiences at work. The interviews are structured to give employees a safe space to share detailed, nuanced, and candid feedback. The team uses Dovetail to find patterns that recur across interviews, and with insights from the research, partners with the leadership to design programs that make work more rewarding for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhjackson/&quot;&gt;Ben Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, the founder, has been in tech for over two decades. He’s done everything from co-running an agency in Brazil, to working on the iOS team at the New York Times, to running mobile at Vice Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Employee feedback&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s currently a problem in how organizations manage their employee feedback: Few practitioners tasked with making sense of the feedback have experience capturing, storing, and finding patterns in qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This less structured approach to research causes all kinds of issues. To start, employees rarely know what they’re getting into: without an informed consent process, as far as they know, their data could end up anywhere. Some (or many) may not feel comfortable participating. Adding to that, interviewers rarely record or transcribe conversation, and often rely on notes or broad takeaways. Because of this, the insights often lack the necessary depth and context to make a real impact when presented to leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The leadership challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often when leadership teams get critical feedback about their team, it’s one or two comments from a survey or a second-hand recount of a manager’s check-in with their report. It’s difficult not to take that feedback personally. If you are a company’s founder and people complain about the company, aren’t they complaining about you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, when many executives hear one piece of critical feedback about their organization out of context, their first instinct is to delegitimize it. They might: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litigate specific language choices or terminology like ‘what does this person mean by bad management?’ or ‘What do they mean by toxic culture?’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to guess the source of anonymous comments and dismiss them as coming from a squeaky wheel or employees with unrealistic expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question the frequency or the severity of the issues raised in the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a tool like Dovetail, doing qualitative research with employees, and tracing those patterns across interviews is that at the end of the study, I can credibly say to the leadership team that 80% of your employees indicated this and 45% of your managers aren’t confident of that. When they hear that, the information takes on a different tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Qualitative analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing qualitative data, you want to bring structure to unstructured data through coding. Historically, researchers used large, unwieldy spreadsheets. But those don’t scale, they aren’t intuitive for collaboration, and they make it hard to keep track of everything. Ben stressed that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is faster when I’m using Dovetail, a platform built for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take the focus off specific comments, Hear Me Out presents a curated reflection of their analysis. The team typically records employee interviews in Zoom before transcribing the audio in Dovetail and redacting all identifiable information: names, office locations, project titles, team names, department names, and anything else that might be recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tool like Dovetail helps you take data that is impossible to visualize and turn it into something you can visualize. Coding takes a long time. Even when I’m going at top speed, it typically takes as long as the original length of tape. Being able to quickly create, organize, reuse, and rename all of those tags is incredibly helpful. Without taking my hands off the keyboard, I can capture a highlight, find an existing tag, and then do that three more times in the space of five seconds. It makes a huge difference because I sometimes deal with hundreds of individual tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hampr harnesses customer insights to build exceptional workplaces with Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/hampr</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/hampr</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hampr is the one-stop solution for workplace needs. The team partners with office administrators to spark a positive and productive environment at work, whether they’re remote or coming into an office or workplace.
This is how Dovetail is helping to power Hampr’s mission to create exceptional experiences in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting started with Dovetail in minutes, not hours&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hampr team is obsessed with providing the best customer experience possible. Whether they’re delivering one-on-one support to their 250+ customers, organizing corporate catering, designing events and celebrations, setting up team activities, or improving the Hampr UX, the growing organization has a lot to look after. This is why Albert Chu, Head of Growth, and his team at Hampr opt for simple, user-friendly tools that make their lives easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using Dovetail, Albert and his team didn’t have a central platform to house, analyze, and make sense of their customer research data. After hearing about Dovetail through an industry connection, Albert decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised when he could sign up and start using the research platform right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hampr is growing quickly. Their current headquarters are in Sydney, having already expanded their services across Australia within a couple of years and more recently offered services into New Zealand and Singapore. Having a platform like Dovetail to house all of their research is important as Hampr continues to scale. That way, customer research insights can be easily accessed and visited over and over to pull out key takeaways and findings as they continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uploading, transcribing, and tagging customer research with ease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hampr is a platform that helps office managers, people managers, or executive assistants easily order catering, pantry items, or organize events for their teams. Hampr users can order everything in one place without having to reach out to different suppliers or vendors and action invoices all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Hampr, Dovetail is a single, centralized platform that makes life easier for those who use it. If the Hampr team has a new project, they kick it off within Dovetail, developing their research plan, including the approach and interview questions, and attaching documents that add context. Albert and his team found Dovetail could streamline their process and fit naturally into their existing research ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding inspiration from a global research community&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with features like transcribing and tagging, Albert and his team find value in Dovetail’s resources. Along with weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/events/live-demo/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;live demo sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;free Slack community&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with 6,000+ other people who conduct research, Dovetail also has a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;blogs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for tips and tricks to help master your research.

From the demo to the Slack community for Dovetail, I’ve had all my questions answered around UX and UI. I’ve also liked the open communication, so I can share feedback and feel like my opinions are heard.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert Chu, Head of Growth, Hampr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for more?

Their platform helps connect people with disability and older Australians with independent Support Workers who operate as small businesses. UX and research sit under Customer Experience at the company, which represents the voice of the customer. As a cross-functional team it&amp;#39;s crucial they’re always conducting research to put the people first, understand how best to support them, and communicate this to product. The team focuses on qualitative research and insights to deliver excellent experiences through design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consolidate data, standardize process, unify tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before establishing their Customer Experience team in 2020, Mable conducted only a small amount of customer research and information was stored across various storage solutions rather than a single place. When the CX Team formed, their research tooling, similar to many other start-ups, was fragmented across different platforms. Insights and knowledge were trapped in isolated documents and siloed in specific teams or individuals. A lot of manual work was needed to search for and locate data across different projects and documents. This process couldn’t to scale, especially to support growth ambitions at Mable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail was introduced at Mable as a single repository for all research notes, transcripts, customer interviews, synthesis, and insights. Data is more organized, faster to find, and easier to share. Locating and extracting past interviews, insights, and key quotes allowed the team to build on customer knowledge instead of repeating research. With everything in one tool, they can structure and streamline the process to save time. Dovetail templates and tags have helped the team standardize flows for different research types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing powerful insights to influence stakeholders and drive user-centered design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, it was difficult for the Mable team to extract quotes or data to share while still having it link back to themes or transcripts. Communicating insights to stakeholders and other departments wasn’t as efficient or impactful as they needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now with Dovetail, the team can create more influence and affect stakeholders with powerful highlight reels and insights reports. Consolidated findings and themes can be traced back to granular bits of data—interviews, video clips, and quotes—which are shared out as Dovetail links. Then, anyone who wants to can deep dive into the full session notes or audio recordings. This helps drive customer empathy inside and outside the CX team and fosters a culture of user-centered decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of a centralized research repository, the business has developed a culture of referring to customer insights to find answers and explanations. Mable no longer focuses solely on quantitative measures but also on understanding the whys. One clear shift has seen the CX team now often receiving requests to provide insights or conduct research on initiatives rather than needing to convince teams to run research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis that connects the dots and empowers different ways of working&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When research was spread across different tools and physical mediums, it was challenging to tie everything together and form a holistic picture. Teams were quantitative data-focused and reacted to metric fluctuations without a deep understanding of the insights behind the data. Many experiments or features were executed based on assumptions rather than customer insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Dovetail repository started to be used, learnings were pulled from multiple research projects, past and present, to provide multi-faceted insights. Now, new initiatives marry qualitative with quantitative to drive forward product decisions. When teams hold different views around product or performance, Dovetail helps them discover insights that point to the root problems and disprove false assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s canvas view allows different ways of mapping and grouping data into themes. The tool’s flexibility has encouraged synthesizing to fit multiple research methods, which has been extremely powerful for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Careship gains a competitive advantage with fast customer insights]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/careship</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/careship</guid><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careship’s mission is to “fundamentally change the way care is delivered”, according to Anne Büttner, a User Experience Researcher at the Berlin-based startup. Anne says Careship know that user research is critical for them to become “the largest and most used platform for care booking in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Careship, user research is employed at every step of the product development process. In the discovery phase, researchers dig into their target group’s needs and pain points to identify product opportunities. They continue with prototyping and testing to see which ideas solve their target group’s problems best, and for their finished product, Careship conducts usability testing to continuously improve their user’s experience with their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting others in front of research is a key tactic in how researchers share their work, as Anne highlights: “As a researcher I am the user advocate, but never see myself as an expert who educates others on the user’s needs. Instead I invite colleagues to frequently participate in user testing sessions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want everyone at Careship to engage with our users and have their own first-hand learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is growing. Within the last six months Careship almost doubled in size—going from a small startup to a medium-sized business—and the process of sharing knowledge and insights from user research has to be adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are beginning to work more closely with Careship’s two business intelligence engineers which allows them to first identify behaviour patterns in quantitative data early on, and then understand the underlying motivations with in-depth qualitative research later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are starting to enable product managers to conduct their own usability tests. This frees up Anne and the research &amp;amp; design team to give them more time to engage in long-term strategic research projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Dovetail helps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail enables us to make use of research data even while the study is still running. This allows us to turn insights into actionable advice without a time lag. As a startup in a quickly changing market this is a strong competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of creating long reports at the end of a study, Dovetail enables Careship’s product team to store, share, and collaborate on research findings while they’re still in the middle of the study. This means they can operate a faster research process, avoid lengthy reports that almost nobody reads, and get more research done in the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My vision is that I can empower every employee to consult the user data with Dovetail for decision making on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail has solved a number of challenges for Careship’s research team, like centralizing data (“No more chaos! Raw data, insights, audio files, video files, photos and sketches all in one place), research analysis (“Quick, easy and adjustable! With the tagging system I can quickly gather all data of interest for very different teams”), and real time collaboration (“I feed all my data into Dovetail immediately so my colleagues can review it”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all, Dovetail lets Anne and her team share bite-sized user research insights with the rest of the organization, while keeping them directly linked to the raw source material. This lets Careship efficiently share knowledge around, helping them offer customers and caregivers the best tools to effectively organize, deliver and manage individual care across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to share insights in digestible bites. When more background information is needed we can access the context of the insight with just one click&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/static/a4c723b4c0bdb1a83bbe7696f0d1ad67/cbe2c/7.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail fuels world-class research at Harvard Business Publishing]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/harvard-business-publishing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/harvard-business-publishing</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a global name in the leadership development publishing space, Harvard Business Publishing (HBP) is a benchmark for quality and distinction. Read on to get a peek at the research that HBP conducts and how Dovetail helps them centralize and democratize their findings while still enabling teams to stay agile and aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Centralized research to stop repeating work and start building on what is known&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, research at Harvard Business Publishing (HBP) has been a priority. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harvard University, HBP has three market groups: Higher Education, Corporate Learning, and the Harvard Business Review Group. Because of these separate entities, their products were built in silos. Teams weren’t able to access each others’ work to gain context and ultimately build better products and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of agile teams within each of HBP’s market groups would be working in sprints around a feature, either running user testing or conducting surveys, and all of this information was captured across multiple platforms with a variety of tools. In the past, research was spread across Google Drive, Wikis, Excel files, JIRA, emails, Survey Monkey, and even written on napkins. While research data was extensive, it usually never left the confines of each team, and as individuals moved teams or left the business, it meant that invaluable research data would be inaccessible and eventually lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of project teams at HBP grew quickly, and the amount of knowledge isolated within these teams grew. Teams were constantly being slowed down by inefficiencies that grew from not having visibility into other research initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid the double-up of this work and to improve efficiency, HBP made plans to prioritize UX and research processes. The company introduced Dovetail to centralize their research data and build a shared brain across cross-functional teams. Dovetail helps these teams collaborate effectively and make informed decisions about the products being built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Democratizing research: Share invaluable findings with teams and stakeholders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of each two-week sprint, project teams at HBP share reports with their stakeholders. Before introducing Dovetail, this report looked like a traditional PowerPoint or PDF that summarized high-level learnings. This summarization presented challenges for the research teams since it would be digested without much context by a few people and then often be forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research has always been valued at HBP, the research team is working on expanding its impact beyond immediate stakeholders. Teams want to inspire employees outside of the research team to explore data and get closer to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Dovetail, HBP researchers can share their findings via one singular and accessible platform. The accessibility means research is democratized, and everyone at HBP can do their own research or explore a library of existing data whenever they need. Packaging the research findings as interview highlight reels and digestible insights within Dovetail means research content is easy for anyone to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking ahead: Standardizing research to keep teams agile and aligned&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of teams working across multiple projects and using a mix of methods meant research was not standardized at HBP. It was difficult to compare research studies and understand nuances within— like how a question was posed, or who participated. It was difficult for the team and stakeholders to compare research studies since the full context wasn’t easily discoverable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of Dovetail, HBP standardized their research process so that anyone could absorb the data to build context. Since the raw data is now organized, HBP team members can quickly browse key takeaways or fully immerse themselves in the granular data rather than having confusion over where the research lives and what content is relevant to them. Standardizing this process also means new team members can be guided through HBP’s research findings to support their learning environment and help in getting them up to speed faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sonder scaled Dovetail fast across every Product Manager, Designer, and Researcher]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/sonder</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/sonder</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sonder provides innovative 24-7 organizational wellbeing and safety support. They’re on a mission to give global access to personalized help, both mental and medical, for every situation by breaking down barriers and helping earlier. As a B2B2C company, they serve customers from large corporations to small businesses and universities, and provide services for their employees, or students. It’s crucial for the team to conduct research to understand what their members pain points are, how they’re reaching out for support, and what they need to build trust and confidence in Sonder. The research and design team aims to bring in user-centricity through exploratory research on new features and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start-up to scale up—scaling research democratization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of Sonder, design teams would conduct research on an ad-hoc basis using a range of tools including google docs, confluence, notes—and store them as slide decks. This worked when the org was small, but these processes were not repeatable and made research challenging to find. As Sonder began transitioning from start-up to scale-up, its operations began to mature, and needed a more specialized tool to scale research quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, the team could build out their research ops and democratize research across the business. Starting with the design team and later product—it was easy to onboard members to the tool by sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@HiDovetail/videos&quot;&gt;Dovetail’s educational video content&lt;/a&gt; and having the guidance of senior internal researchers. Team members started as observers, took notes in Dovetail, and collaborated on tagging, highlighting, and creating insights. They often reached an ‘aha’ moment when sharing insights with stakeholders, seeing the tangible value and impact of their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From one to fifteen—now all product managers, designers, and researchers are confidently and actively contributing to the Dovetail repository. They’ve successfully grown their research practice from ad-hoc to process-oriented, empowering many to be involved, collect information, and contribute to a rich library of feedback from users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Centralize to learn—Building products based on better research, stronger insights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data was not centralized when research was done on an ad-hoc basis. The longevity of the research’s value suffered as it was often lost after completion. Insights made were influenced by the researcher’s interpretation and weren’t traced back to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail’s repository, Sonder has centralized their data to quickly build context and serve their customers better. Now, all video interviews are uploaded and transcribed in Dovetail, insights are created, and relevant files and data are stored in projects. This provides a holistic view and allows anyone to dig deeper and build their own context. With everything in one place, the team continuously learns and accesses past data to build upon, and insights truly capture the voice of the customer. Evidence-based decision-making drives design and product decisions, creating more confidence in what they’re building to provide global access to personalized safety, medical, and mental health support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supercharging cross-team collaboration and spreading customer empathy at Sonder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the old systems, collaboration was complex, and it was challenging to get research out to stakeholders not immediately in the product circle. Research stayed within silos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since implementing Dovetail, collaboration across teams has improved immensely both within product and outside. Now when conducting research, members can pair and collaborate on multiple projects and cross-share insights, which help the team work more efficiently and effectively. The sharing experience has extended outside of even product, with marketing, sales and more, who love being exposed to more insights and feedback from customers and members. The team can share very specific and relevant data, as they’ve created specific tags for different departments when analyzing, and can bucket information for later use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, insights have injected more customer empathy. It’s now the norm to present with Dovetail and share insights that show their real users within the company. Empathy is a core value for the organization, and with highlight reels, employees can see customers talk about their needs and pain points with the product, truly empathize and know that what they are working on is valuable for the end user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zoco Design builds trust and legitimacy with traceable customer insights in Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/zoco-design</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/zoco-design</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ZoCo Design is a UX and product design studio with a mission to champion human-centered technology. They work with customer-centric software companies—from big corporations across industries like healthcare, finance, retail, and more, to rapidly growing, high-potential startups—all with the goal of creating meaningful and positive experiences for people. The team conducts a mix of quantitative and qualitative research, with special expertise on the latter, and uses those insights to shape the strategy, architecture, and design of digital products. Research is crucial at ZoCo to remove bias and assumptions about what customers want and make confident and traceable decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From an art to a science—legitimizing research with a visible process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ZoCo’s research practice began taking form, it evolved into something more art than science. Presentations to stakeholders involved pictures of sticky notes with handwriting and insights which were impossible to tie to the source. Clients couldn’t visualize how researchers got to their conclusion and raised questions about the validity of insights. ZoCo’s team was looking for a tool to demonstrate the merit of their craft and bring greater transparency to the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail’s clear and structured workflow, ZoCo was able to create tangible insights that connect back to the customer. Now 100 percent of interviews are transcribed in Dovetail, which helps reduce human bias, as well as workload, and creates a single source of truth for all themes and bigger ideas. Clients are more bought in because they can picture the steps it took to get to the insight, including transcription, highlighting, tagging, and affinity mapping. Insights that informed the final design solution were proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, stakeholders love Dovetail reports as the format is flexible, creative, and engaging, making insights easier to digest. Graphs, pictures, articles, and powerful customer videos and quotes are nested into insights, helping to legitimize and strengthen recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail operates as a repository that the client can continue to build from, even without ZoCo, and serves as a single point of truth for their customer insights. It’s a living, breathing thing that can change over time, and align cross-functional teams to what researchers are learning in real-time. ZoCo’s clients experience so much information siloing on their large product teams, but Dovetail makes it easier to share and evolve insights over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Easy to get started and contribute, easy to enjoy and experiment &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a small design company developing its research capabilities, ZoCo’s initial processes were scrappy and inconsistent. Individuals had different approaches to research processes, which made it difficult for new teammates to get up to speed and start contributing. Manual and unstandardized tasks such as transcribing and affinity mapping were daunting to learn, time-consuming to conduct, and complex to elevate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since implementing Dovetail, the research process has become less intimidating because it guides users step by step. From transcribing customer videos to analyzing and organizing data to reaching valuable insights, Dovetail makes research more enjoyable with a beautiful UI experience. The tool is simple and intuitive enough that no training is needed for new teammates at ZoCo who find it easy to jump in, contribute, and understand clearly when a research objective has been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once onboarded, it’s not long before members become power users. Dovetail is flexible and accommodating such that researchers can experiment and find new ways of working—building taxonomies and identifying patterns across projects. The ZoCo team has been able to hone their craft and showcase their work in a way that builds as much excitement with clients as it does internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bringing manual tasks and physical collaboration into the twenty-first century&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZoCo’s old way of working was manual and not very collaborative—think fast short-hand note-taking, post-it notes that fell off the board and got lost, and live affinity mapping where you just had to be there. These tasks were extremely time-consuming, and the team needed a way to bring their research process online with the movement to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Dovetail helps ZoCo save time and collaborate remotely with digital highlighting, tagging, and affinity mapping. Transcription enables the team to speed up their process and creates a paper trail that always leads back to why decisions were made. The project readme section quickly gets team members onboarded to the goals, hypothesis, and approach. It’s intuitive to move across themes and insights and build on their colleagues’ work. Though the team is now hybrid and often works in the studio, these processes have stayed in Dovetail. ZoCo champions the modern age of research which prioritizes customer feedback in a collaborative, sharable, and seamless way so that they can focus on getting to the heart of customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[DoubleCheck Research outshines the competition and wins clients using Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/doublecheck-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/doublecheck-research</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DoubleCheck helps B2B technology and manufacturing companies better understand why they win some deals yet lose others through detailed buyer and customer interviews. Whether it’s product, competitive, brand, or even sales experience feedback, DoubleCheck aims to truly capture the buyer’s experience and ultimate decision drivers and package their findings in such a way to enable their clients to drive positive change within their organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoubleCheck’s founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansorley/&quot;&gt;Ryan Sorley&lt;/a&gt; takes us through how Dovetail helps influence his clients’ short and long-term go-to-market strategies. Ryan likens their work to a romantic breakup. “The breaker-upper tries hard not to hurt the others feelings and lets them down easy, ‘it’s not you, it’s me,’ but in reality, it is them. Then the breaker-upper shares how they really feel about the other person with their therapist,” says Ryan, explaining why his clients use DoubleCheck to run interviews. “That’s where we fit into the business world. We’re the therapist. We’re the neutral yet experienced third party. As an independent research firm, we strive to create an uber-safe environment for each person we’re interviewing. In that environment, they tend to open up a whole lot more with us than with our client directly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uncovering Dovetail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given DoubleCheck’s business model relies on conducting and analyzing such a high quantity of customer interviews, Dovetail was a logical solution. “As a services business that conducts qualitative research day-in and day-out, we were looking for a way to easily take unstructured data and structure it so that we could identify and track research themes across a set of interviews,” Ryan reflects. “We were leveraging Qualtrics’ automated text tagging capabilities and ended up spending way too much time fixing a bunch of irrelevant system-generated tags when we stumbled upon Dovetail and had this moment. It was like the universe answered our prayers. It felt so much like Dovetail was built just for us. It checked all of our boxes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dovetail has enabled us to increase the value of our client engagements exponentially. It’s also become a powerful differentiator and has led to many new clients signing up with us over alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we’re going through the onboarding or sales process with new clients, we highlight Dovetail as a research workspace that they’ll get access to, adding a greater level of value to each engagement,” says Ryan. “The fact that Dovetail is easy to use, has a beautiful interface, and is approachable is a huge differentiator. Unlike many traditional analytics tools, you don’t need a degree in data science to use the platform and quickly understand what you’re looking at!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer intelligence, centralized&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan tells us that DoubleCheck’s clients have traditionally struggled to centralize buyer and customer intelligence in a way that’s consistent, easy to access, and easy to analyze. “Research is most valuable when you’re able to identify clear insights and opportunities and package the findings in a format that is easily shared, understood, and consumed by many,” says Ryan. “Not overly complex, not hard to follow, and not something that requires a detailed explanation.” Dovetail has enabled the team at DoubleCheck to create “bite-sized chunks” of insight and provide them to their clients. “People in sales leadership, product management, competitive intelligence, marketing, customer success, and the C-suite depend on those little nuggets of information to gauge their effectiveness, inform their strategy, and make strategic decisions and investments,” asserts Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A research hub for each client&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoubleCheck starts by interviewing a buyer from a company that either did or didn’t select their client. Then their editorial team reviews the transcript, summarizes the interview, and writes a set of key findings. Ryan indicates that DoubleCheck “ultimately creates a series of deal reports within the insights page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the DoubleCheck team tags each report within the data page.” Ryan explains that “DoubleCheck clients can read each detailed deal report, end-to-end, to learn about what happened in a particular deal. They can also hop to the data page to review the tag groups to identify what’s trending across the set of interviews, or they can jump straight to the charts page for that all-important data visualization which they often need for internal planning meetings.” Ryan goes on to explain, “We include learning objectives in each report and have corresponding tag groups for those areas. We create research alerts, short summaries of a competitor, or key topics such as price or sales experience feedback. We might create an insight card with both positive mentions and negative quotes or sound bites. We also regularly drop in charts that we created in Dovetail and often provide our written analysis and recommendations at the top of the alert. Clients love them!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan outlines the process of presenting the executive summary and findings from a set of interviews. “We’re typically in the room with the C-suite. That’s when they’re able to hear how they’re doing, how the sales team is performing, what buyers are saying about competitors, and where their greatest opportunities for improvement exist. It’s the moment where we take all of the little bite-sized chunks of information we’ve collected through our research and weave them together to tell a story that should result in our client taking measurable actions to improve outcomes across their business. What’s great about Dovetail is that the platform makes our job exponentially easier. As most of our programs are ongoing, we’re able to weave those stories together from one quarter or year to the next!”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SafetyCulture puts the customer at the heart of decision with Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/safetyculture</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/safetyculture</guid><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SafetyCulture is a global technology company that supports businesses to do their best work every day. Its flagship products, &lt;a href=&quot;https://safetyculture.com/iauditor/&quot;&gt;iAuditor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edapp.com/&quot;&gt;EdApp&lt;/a&gt;, help organizations achieve safer and higher quality workplaces all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Customer obsession&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think customer: Hold the customer at the heart of everything we do. We give a s#!t,” is one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://safetyculture.com/about/&quot;&gt;the four values&lt;/a&gt; SafetyCulture operates by and leaves no ambiguity when it comes to putting the customer first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of Design &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/manojverghese/&quot;&gt;Manoj Verghese&lt;/a&gt; attributes the evolution of SafetyCulture’s products to how firmly ingrained customer obsession is in their DNA. He recounts a saying that SafetyCulture’s founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-anear-9b331835/&quot;&gt;Luke Anear&lt;/a&gt; lives by and a principle Manoj advocates for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ever not sure about what you’re doing at work, talk to a customer, and you’ll figure it out; the answer will come, you’ll know where you have to focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Designer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/juleslipman/&quot;&gt;Jules Lipman&lt;/a&gt; is unwavering on the importance of leadership driving customer-centricity, “If it doesn’t come from the top, it’s very difficult to generate,” she says. “Luke lives and breathes the customer journey. He wants to hear customer stories. That’s how he makes decisions. I don’t think I’ve been at a company where the customer has had more focus than here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Managers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hindsmatt/&quot;&gt;Matt Hinds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-wolf/&quot;&gt;Natasha Wolf&lt;/a&gt; mimic the sentiment. “For us to achieve our mission, we need to see that customers are getting value from using our tools,” according to Natasha. Matt is unequivocal; he says that everyone rallies behind the customer. They sit at the core of SafetyCulture. “We spend a lot of time talking to our customers,” he says. “It’s super important to ‘think customer’ when we’re making any decision, it’s where everything starts from, and it’s how we measure impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SafetyCulture’s research journey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SafetyCulture’s early research efforts were “scrappy and nice,” according to Manoj, who’s been at SafetyCulture for close to six years. They used several tools, including Confluence, Google Hangouts, Google Meet, and they had a Slack channel for incoming Intercom messages. Finding relevant information was done using Command-F, collating the answers, and putting it together on Confluence. “Then our researcher left, someone new came in, and it was hard to find that information,” he says. As their product and customer base changed, Manoj acknowledged that a new approach to research was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt and Jules, who have joined more recently, also noticed changes in the research process. Matt described having to sift through seemingly endless spreadsheets of feedback when he joined in late 2020. Jules dug deeper into the root cause, highlighting a problem around how they kept research. “It was kept on Confluence, we had different Google docs, teams were not necessarily recording their videos, and it wasn’t all being kept in the same place. It was very challenging at that point to find and re-find information about different areas,” Jules explains. “The team recognized there was a problem, so it was easy to say we’re going to start trialing Dovetail and set expectations for what we wanted from designers, PMs, and the rest of the team. It was a well-supported journey, and everyone was excited to use it as a solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manoj reflects on the adoption, “We needed a system to house our research. We tried many tools and processes, but nothing worked until Dovetail. As we grew from a team of 50 to 150, and then 150 to almost 500 in multiple regions, there was design, product, customer success (which was now becoming a proper team), support (which is becoming a bigger team), all talking to the customer,” he says. “This left us with scattered pockets of information with no alignment, and we wanted to collate it all together in one place so that there were no wasted efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is key so that we have one place where we have the voice of the customer stored, and people can go in there and add to it or consume it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Centralized source of truth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone at SafetyCulture wants to develop a deeper customer understanding, so creating a centralized source of truth was a no-brainer. Matt highlights the impact it has on product managers. “A source of truth that gets everyone on the same page quicker is an absolute game-changer for someone like a product manager whose entire role revolves around that,” he says. Natasha also feels the impact of having a research repository at SafetyCulture. “Anyone in the team can dive into your research space, access the same data you’re accessing, see the volume metrics around different kinds of requests, and view customer interviews,” she remarks. “This means they can deeply understand the problems they’re solving in a way that giving them a feature request doesn’t accomplish. Having a source of truth makes the voice of the customer accessible to everyone, and we’re all expected to keep up to date with a single, easy-to-use tool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules amplifies this sentiment, commenting on the ease of using Dovetail and getting everyone on board:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail has everything in one place, meaning you and the rest of the team only need to remember one link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of a research repository lies in its accessibility. People across many different functions can connect with the customer and use that enhanced understanding to drive business decisions. Staff Quality Engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyakonnur/&quot;&gt;Divya Konnur&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Design &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/manojverghese/&quot;&gt;Manoj Verghese&lt;/a&gt;, and DesignOps Manager &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/riachan/&quot;&gt;Ria Chan&lt;/a&gt; all see Dovetail as a centralized source of truth where they can uncover research and foster a deeper understanding of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From research to roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer knowledge is pivotal to product development and helps answer burning questions around prioritization and validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research findings are the headlights that should drive all product decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritization seems to be the thorn in every product manager’s side; Natasha Wolf is no different, “I can’t see in front of me without the research shedding light on what’s coming up. They’re the headlights to how I define the direction I should be heading in.” Natasha points to the importance of strategic resource allocation as the business scales. “We need to ask the questions, Why would we build this? What’s the problem we’re solving for the customer? Are we confident that this is a solution that will get the outcomes they need for their lives to be improved?” she says. “Customer research is essential to understand who our customers are, what problems they have, and validate that our solution will solve those problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt chats about the importance of risk and validation in a scale-up business. “When we’re taking a product to market, validation through customer research is how we can de-risk the process and ultimately validate whether it’s worth taking to market,” he says. “It’s about validating the investment that we’re going to make, which is particularly important for our stage of business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules reflects on how she was able to influence the product roadmap with research, even as she joined SafetyCulture remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. “When I joined SafetyCulture, I worked from home straight away. The engineers who had been in the team for a while had a perception of what the roadmap would look like for the product. We started doing research and uncovered that there was another route we should be following,” she explains. “We didn’t have the ability to build rapport with the team in person, given that we were remote. What helped was being able to share foundational information along with the actual one-on-ones that we did. The team could watch them, read the transcripts, and see how we’ve tagged them during remote workshops.” Jules emphasizes how significant solving customer problems is for the engineers in her team and how she was able to answer their many questions about prioritization and the customer journey by engaging them with the end-to-end research process. During this time, she says, a good deal of trust was built across the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Include everyone in the organization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SafetyCulture team highlights how everyone uses Dovetail for various purposes and how getting the whole organization on board supercharges the platform and places the voice of the customer at the center of everything they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher, Jules is provided with a moment of joy when she realized other teams were self-discovering research. In particular, she recounts how SafetyCulture’s sales team engages with the product. “They’ve been going into Dovetail and finding interviews with customers they deal with and seeing some of the updated prototypes. It’s been great for our team to feel like a much bigger unit that values feedback from all inputs.” Ria also shares her experiences with other functions using Dovetail to enhance their customer understanding. “We’ve been sharing customer interviews to the sales, marketing, and success functions. It’s great that other people who aren’t in the product function can go into Dovetail and quickly find videos, interviews, or feedback that could be relevant to their customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech Lead and Staff Software Engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/waleedusman/&quot;&gt;Waleed Usman&lt;/a&gt; and Staff Quality Engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyakonnur/&quot;&gt;Divya Konnur&lt;/a&gt; chat about their self-service experience with research. Waleed emphasizes how Dovetail has helped him digest information from customer interviews. “I’m able to better participate in product discussions by relating to what I’ve heard from customers,” he remarks. Divya echoes this sentiment, illustrating how Dovetail provided an easier way to consume the totality of customer feedback and ask better questions during planning. “It helped us gain confidence in identifying customer problems and picking solutions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Project44 streamlines data overload with Dovetail’s centralized insights hub]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/project44</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/project44</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Project44’s mission is to make supply chains work. They do this by creating a connected, predictable, and sustainable world. Read on to learn how Alyssa Kreer, Research Ops Manager, and her team at project44 team tackle research with Dovetail to improve products, processes, and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than sticking to one research approach, project44 adapts to the needs of each customer from a wide range of industries, including consumer goods, food and beverage, retail, manufacturing, and life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Juggling high volumes of research in a customer-obsessed team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has always been a huge part of what project44 does. Alyssa orchestrates high-quality research across their design team and people who do research (PWDR). The organization empowers the team to be curious about their research and the people they’re solving problems for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since project44 is obsessed with their customers, research is highly prioritized. To create exceptional product experiences, the team is encouraged to learn from customers and really understand their needs and challenges. Their approach is collaborative and driven by curiosity and empathy. Every research project starts with a designer speaking with customers, using different research methods to gather insights. Insights then inform every design decision the project44 team makes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each initiative is a priority at project44. This means one of the teams’ biggest challenges is juggling many research initiatives simultaneously. Project44’s teams— from product designers to project managers—are constantly interacting with customers, whether it be in the field or conducting remote research feedback sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A flexible repository to adapt for every project44 customer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the project44 team members are conducting guerrilla research at a truck bazaar in Turkey or leading research sessions with their many European and North American customers, it’s important that they have a flexible tool to meet them where they are. With Dovetail, designers can develop research plans, upload research artifacts on their time, house notes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/highlight-and-tag-project-content/&quot;&gt;pull out themes with tagging,&lt;/a&gt; then share and socialize findings with internal stakeholders. Without a centralized platform like Dovetail, the team would need to take more time to collect, make sense of, and share their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Dovetail, the project44 teams have a unified place where they can store &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;their research data. It’s essential to have a tool that works as a repository for research findings, as well as a tagging system to synthesize qualitative data. Dovetail also has built-in features to create insights and share out their research findings or takeaways with stakeholders. Alyssa says, “This is so validating when it comes to product feature iterations we’re working on, which is constant at project44.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saving time by simplifying a complex research approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is project44’s core research tool. The designers and PWDR use Dovetail every day, saving them time on juggling different research platforms that make it hard to pull out key takeaways or find older research content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the project44 team can have around 20 research projects on the go at any given time, they have an established process in place. The team kicks off a project by interviewing their customers and uploading that qualitative content into Dovetail. From there, they synthesize that data and either develop a robust research findings document or they’ll use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-findings-insights/&quot;&gt;insights feature&lt;/a&gt; to summarize takeaways from that particular research phase. Finally, they easily share these research findings with their stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For project44, housing all their research artifacts in one platform is ideal. It means there is one single source of truth, and the content can be visited and revisited again and again. Dovetail has helped the project44 team to understand their products and features and what features to design and build next. The Dovetail platform has also helped cross-functional visibility within project44’s greater product organization, so colleagues on different product pillars have access to the takeaways and outcomes from hundreds of customer sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, project44’s goal is to continue focusing on building out an interactive, functional research participant panel. To achieve this, Alyssa and her team are thoughtfully and deliberately creating a process to run simultaneous, qualitative research initiatives, bypassing the manual process of scrambling to find multiple participants and avoiding contacting the same participants too often. This panel, hosted in Dovetail, will be a centralized place for the design team and PWDR to search for and source customer participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kickstarter ignites action with viral customer insights in Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/kickstarter</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/kickstarter</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kickstarter’s mission is to help bring creative projects to life. From artwork to camping gear to tabletop games, anything that feels like it’s missing from the world. Their research team works to understand creators and backers and how best to empower and serve them, help spread awareness, and build an audience for respective creative projects. Their research, design, and product teams work extremely closely to conduct concept and product testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stop repeating research—centralize data to prevent good insights from going to waste&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using Dovetail, research at Kickstarter was scattered across Google Drive folders and different platforms, making it incredibly challenging to find data for researchers. This limited the life of the data itself because nobody could discover or rediscover the relevant information when needed. Often teams would be halfway through a project and realize similar research had already been done by a member who’d departed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, Kickstarter centralized all its research into one powerful and searchable tool. Now, when getting to the bottom of a customer problem, they’ve got a bank of insights at their fingertips, and the first step of the process is to look for historical reports and build on existing work. In some cases, dozens of pieces uncovered meant the team could progress without designing an entirely new study. At Kickstarter, they’re building a rich and constantly growing repository of raw data and reports in Dovetail that compounds in value and means the team never has to repeat work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A viral sharing experience where the research drives itself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Kickstarter, there was no standard for sharing out research, and it was difficult to bring stakeholders into the process or engage them with long reports. Scheduling a large presentation was the only method to gain a lot of attention, but it was incredibly time-consuming. Only a limited number of people were aware of some research findings, and they weren’t always those who would benefit most from the information. Research was conducted, ingested, and forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kickstarter’s research is now readily accessible in Dovetail, making it easy for stakeholders to self-serve relevant findings. Because everything is interlinked and structured, stakeholders have the option to take in the high-level key insights or dig deeper and listen directly from the participants themselves. Readers found the blog-style format of the reports more digestible, transparent, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, employees share research independently of explicit efforts to circulate it. Small clips of customers can go viral in the organization, driving empathy across the company and creating greater research interest and buy-in. Before adopting Dovetail, people were eager for research and user feedback, but results were rarely shared or discussed. Within the first 18 months of implementing Dovetail, their research team of 3 has shared 106 reports—more than one a week—driving hundreds of views of highlights and customer videos and sparking discussion across Slack and team meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A simple, streamlined tool that elevates the research craft&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kickstarter’s research process was spread across multiple platforms, tools, and spreadsheets. It required manual note-taking and tagging, which was often too disorganized, complex, and technical for people who could otherwise contribute. As the function wasn’t fully mature yet, the lack of formal research background meant there was no standard process, no one organizing or guiding discussions, and no technical oversight. This risked decisions being subject to bias or based on invalid data. Dovetail provided a simple solution to streamline the research process and made it easy to onboard and elevate their research craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, Kickstarter was able to automate manual tasks like transcription and speed up other tasks like grouping and finding themes. The structured workflow cultivated more direction on how to tag and extract quality insights. Now there’s an intuitive, speedy, and organized tool that new starters find easy to learn and follow, empowering them to contribute from day one. Kickstarter has found the tool encourages the team to conduct richer and more reliable research than they would without it. Dovetail legitimizes the work being done and builds more confidence in the health of Kickstarter’s research programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mathspace unifies five tools into one, driving efficiency with Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/mathspace</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/mathspace</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mathspace’s mission is to be the right help at the right time for every student. The team conducts research on a diverse range of students from many backgrounds to remove bias and try to meet the needs of every student out there. Mathspace is focused on building simple, useable, and extremely engaging products for both teachers and students. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building a roadmap with evidence-based findings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has always been crucial at Mathspace, but as a small company, they lacked the capacity to scale user interviews and feedback analysis. The growing company invested in Dovetail to streamline and standardize processes and get through large amounts of research to increase confidence in what they were building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail’s analysis and synthesis tools, Mathspace can distill its vast amount of research data into key insights, turning qualitative customer input into measurable output. Quantifying tags and highlights allow the team to identify important themes, align on core problems, and prioritize areas with the highest impact. It’s now much easier to build consensus and buy-in from stakeholders around a research-informed roadmap that points directly to findings and customer quotes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making research insights stick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathspace used to share out long paper reports or disparate Trello boards that summarized the more granular elements of research but left out the more compelling and emotionally motivating parts to support the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since switching to Dovetail, stakeholders can view insights that directly link to individual video snippets or a collection of related notes, allowing them to go as high-level or as deep as they need. This approach has made the research more visible, tangible, and digestible. More importantly, the insights stick with stakeholders and have a much more profound effect. The sharing capability is so seamless and impactful that even teams outside of research are demonstrating interest and buying in to the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data to insight in one tool, not five&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathspace had a lot of input coming in from multiple different sources—interviews, surveys, support tickets, in-app feedback, and NPS—but they didn’t have a good tool to manage data from so many sources. Doing big batches of research meant lots of time spent chewing through it all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail’s video integration and transcription, Mathspace can radically streamline their research process and get to the work they didn’t previously have bandwidth for. Now, thousands of student feedback pieces can be read and grouped with affinity maps and 100 percent of user interviews are reviewed and tagged in Dovetail. Their team transformed Dropbox folders with endless interview files into Dovetail note boards, and with all their data organized in one tool, the team can get to valuable insights much faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Honeycomb Works supercharges development and innovation with Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/the-honeycomb-works</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/the-honeycomb-works</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At The Honeycomb Works, they’re on a mission for everyone at work to feel like they belong and are free to invent. They work with organizations to build cultures of inclusion, diversity, and innovation. They provide consultancy services, training, and events, but their core focus is their Honeycomb platform which is both an impact measurement tool and supports people to develop new positive habits based on the science of behavior change. User research is the core of what they do and how they create impact as the team constantly strives to gain a deep understanding of people, their behaviors, actions, thoughts, needs, and challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UX and research team work in an agile development cycle with lots of iterative learning and experimentation with qualitative research—academic research, usability testing, and user interviews—at the forefront.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Transcription for all accents—80% accurate, 30% faster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honeycomb conducts research across a diverse set of users to understand how to build cultures of belonging and inclusion. The previously used transcription tool was costly and inaccurate, especially when trying to parse different accents of customers whose first language was not English. This creates more work for the team, who regularly have to go back and listen to the audio, edit, and correct errors in the script. When a big project came up, the team realized it was time to switch to a more effective and cost-efficient transcription solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail transcription was precise—even with accents—and affordable. It cut down process time by a third with ninety-seven percent accurate transcription for the team to start their analysis from. Dovetail&amp;#39;s custom vocabulary allowed keywords used in the project to be defined, helping transcription become even more accurate. The team now confidently transcribes using Dovetail, knowing only small details will need to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Say goodbye to silos with a transparent and collaborative tool &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across separate tools at Honeycomb created challenges in keeping stakeholders aligned and teams from working in silos. When a project started, responsibilities were delegated to individual product team members: setting the hypothesis, defining the taxonomy, running interviews, tagging, writing notes, and generating shareable insights. This process worked the team was still small. But as the maturity of UX grew, they needed a tool to foster a stronger culture of collaboration across their body of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting Dovetail aligned with Honeycomb&amp;#39;s new direction in elevating how their teams build knowledge collectively. With a centralized structured tool, the research process was transparent and allowed for flexible, real-time, and remote collaboration. It was easy to bring people into the platform with an intuitive user experience and a short learning curve. Across projects, teams can now refine tags and taxonomies as they go to identify more patterns and trends. Teams can work on projects together—adding notes, comments, and affinity mapping at the same time — which helps keep stakeholders aligned. Now, when thinking about solutions, the team starts with the research to drive product direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better decision-making with a simple, efficient, and reliable end-to-end research process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has always been a worthwhile, albeit time-consuming, investment at Honeycomb. The company is constantly striving to design a more intuitive, impactful, and user-centered product. However, the workload from analyzing qualitative data could be overwhelming at times, and the tools they were using didn&amp;#39;t make it easier. It was very manual and inefficient to move data from audio, video recordings, and transcripts to Miro or sticky notes on walls, before eventually sharing reports out. Data would sometimes get lost along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail was easy to use, sped up the research, and helped the team more accurately and holistically understand the data. By bringing the process into one place, they were able to reduce manual labor and switching pains between tools when synthesizing and never lose data again. Dovetail was extremely visual and end-to-end—from transcribing, tagging, and affinity mapping, to presenting the insights—creating a richer experience for consolidating more data, faster. With Dovetail&amp;#39;s workflow structure, it&amp;#39;s very clear whether a goal or objective is hit from a business perspective, and the team has more confidence that the research findings are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eucalyptus uses Dovetail to democratize customer research and shape the future of healthcare]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/eucalyptus</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/eucalyptus</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Eucalyptus dreams, builds, and runs digital healthcare companies. Over 250,000 patients trust their five healthcare brands, including men’s healthcare brand Pilot, women’s fertility and telehealth service Kin, skincare brand Software, sexual wellness company Normal, and women’s healthcare brand Juniper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eucalyptus’ brands, known as “digital clinics,” specialize in areas that can be stigmatized in a traditional healthcare system. The innovative organization takes product development very seriously, so naturally, customer research plays a huge role. Read on to learn how Lyena Fi, Senior Product Manager, and the Eucalyptus team are revolutionizing healthcare through customer closeness - made possible by Dovetail’s centralized research platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Patients across our brands love us, and they inspire us to do our best work every day.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revolutionizing healthcare through customer closeness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eucalyptus creates digital healthcare companies that flip traditional healthcare services on their head. Whether it&amp;#39;s men’s health, skincare, women’s obesity, fertility, or sexual health, traditional healthcare systems often fall short in providing the care that’s needed. That’s why Eucalyptus is committed to creating specialized treatment and healthcare advice so that &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; has access to the care they need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Eucalyptus, getting closer to their customers is what helps them build brands, services, and products their customers love. To do this, they use Dovetail to manage all of their customer research. Lyena and her teammates speak to their customers about the problem spaces of healthcare. Their feedback becomes the foundation of the product strategy that gets built to solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, the team carries out a robust research approach by identifying goals and creating questions that align with them. This is worked into their strategy, along with who they’ll be speaking with to hear this feedback. After the research is conducted, the team then analyzes their findings with things like trends, categorizing different patient identities, and identifying which point they’re at in their unique customer journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I love the highlight feature in Dovetail. It makes it really easy to highlight a trend across multiple projects.“&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyena Fi, Senior Product Manager, Eucalyptus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supporting continuous research through one centralized platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eucalyptus moves quickly, as they’re constantly evolving their digital clinics to deliver the best experience for their customers. To keep up with their growth, it’s important to have a centralized platform to keep research organized, secure, and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eucalyptus works cross-functionally, so having the ability for anyone to find, absorb, and revisit findings is really important. If the organization is doing research on side effects, for example, the product team can create medical interventions— a treatment or action to prevent or treat disease or improve health, to track those side effects easily. The medical team is then able to deliver more specialized advice for those interventions. Their marketing team can share that information in their communications to customers, so they have expectations set early on how to prevent side effects. Since research is stored in Dovetail forever, the Eucalyptus team can re-watch customer interviews to improve their customer experience continuously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Democratizing research across marketing, data, creative, and engineering teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their obsession with their customers, Eucalyptus encourages everyone to participate in research. While researchers are responsible for leading and synthesizing the research on any given project, nearly every function at Eucalyptus is involved with customer research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of their function, everyone at Eucalyptus is working towards the same goal. That’s why every team member is given the opportunity to understand their customers on a deeper level by building context and empathy through raw customer data. Since it’s all hosted in Dovetail, anyone can browse key takeaways through &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-findings-insights/&quot;&gt;insights&lt;/a&gt; and reports. Eucalyptus shows no signs of slowing down, with plans to take on more digital clinics. So having a point of reference as they continue to build and nurture more products makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Our product-led engineers have said they’ve found Dovetail really valuable. After being on customer calls, they’re able to make decisions that cater to our customers to surprise or delight more when they’re building a feature.“&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyena Fi, Senior Product Manager, Eucalyptus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netguru reclaims 38+ hours per week by centralizing insights with Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/netguru</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/netguru</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Netguru is a digital acceleration agency that specializes in designing, shipping, and scaling beautiful products—efficiently. Tischner European University lecturer and Netguru Senior UX Researcher &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ewelinaszczepaniakwenting/&quot;&gt;Ewelina Szczepaniak-Wenting&lt;/a&gt; uses Dovetail to collaborate on projects with stakeholders spread across the globe. As a result, Dovetail helps Ewelina save over 38 hours of manual work every week and shares more than three insights a week that stakeholders and clients love to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Juggling multiple research projects across teams with ease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With clients ranging from vehicle manufacturers and investment banks to real estate agents and healthcare organizations, the team at Netguru needs a platform that’s flexible to cater to their range of clients as well as accessible to keep all of their content organized. They approach every project as a team, so having a platform like Dovetail means anyone can hop in and contribute asynchronously without missing a beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ewelina and the team at Netguru use Dovetail as their customer insights platform to host, examine, and share key research findings in a safe, data-protected environment. Whether it be interviews, usability testing, market research, or anything in between, Dovetail is built to house and pull insights from all kinds of customer data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Netguru’s projects are diverse in nature, the flexibility of Dovetail means each project is easily adapted to suit their client’s needs. Features like built-in video transcribing also mean they don’t need to waste time hopping between different platforms; Dovetail can &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/transcribe-video-and-audio/#Supported-languages&quot;&gt;transcribe interviews in 30+ different languages&lt;/a&gt; in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Researching efficiently and effectively to save 38+ hours of work weekly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Dovetail, Ewelina and her team spent hours manually switching between multiple platforms, pulling out and editing important callouts—risking information loss with each step. Today, Dovetail helps keep all their research data organized and searchable from one repository, saving her over 38 hours of time every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netguru knows Dovetail keeps their data safe with their gold standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/security/&quot;&gt;security features&lt;/a&gt;, including data encryption in transit and at rest, full GDPR compliance, and administrative access controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the digital acceleration era, Netguru has to move quickly. So much so that for the fifth time in the annual FT 1000 ranking recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://hubs.ly/Q01PHkms0&quot;&gt;recognized them as one of the fastest-growing European companies&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, Dovetail is built for scale, so the platform can grow alongside Netguru rather than slow them down. Features like global tag boards, custom templates, and a customizable home page allow Netguru to standardize their research approach. Custom data retention helps keep the organization safe and data-compliant as they scale. With Dovetail’s built-in features like global tag boards, highlights, and custom data retention, the team at Netguru can continue to add new projects while keeping their content organized across their workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing digestible research insights that stakeholders actually want to read&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing insights was once challenging, says Ewelina. But with Dovetail, she and her team are empowered to share insights with stakeholders easily. Netguru can tell compelling evidence-based narratives with multi-column layouts, video clips, images, and text for every project. Within six months, the team has shared 20 insights—more than three a week, driving hundreds of views of customer highlights and video clips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since insights in Dovetail have the option to be shared publicly, the team at Netguru doesn’t need to rely on dull PowerPoint slides or wonder if anyone will actually read the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they’re not sharing insights that could compromise their data in any way, the team at Netguru also uses Dovetail’s accessibility features. This means the team has full control over &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/access-controls/&quot;&gt;who can access any given project&lt;/a&gt; and for what amount of time-based on user roles or individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dovetail makes it so easy to create insights for our clients and stakeholders. Now, they can see key takeaways backed by short video clips all from one link. We’re able to show rather than tell our findings in a beautiful and digestible format, and we’ve heard feedback from our stakeholders that they’re actually excited to see our insights, which is so impactful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ewelina Szczepaniak-Wenting, Senior UX Researcher, Netguru&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Applying Dovetail in university classrooms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of her work at Netguru, Ewelina also lectures in a post-graduate program for designers at Tischner European University in Krakow. Before using Dovetail, Ewelina taught her students about tagging taxonomies with a platform that required post-its, manual grouping, and manually changing the colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Ewelina uses Dovetail to show her students how to construct analysis by tagging, which automatically connects the text to video clips and statistics, all in one organized page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Okta securely scales customer insights across 30+ teams]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/okta</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/okta</guid><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From seamlessly accessing applications in day-to-day work, to buying a ticket for a baseball game or booking a flight, Okta exists to enable anyone to use any technology securely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over two hundred Dovetail users, Okta champions a mixed-method approach leaning heavily on qualitative research. The nature of their product is built on trust, so customer insights are their lifeblood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Right access, right time, security first&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okta’s research team works in partnership with legal and data privacy ops on handling the sensitive information that forms the foundation of their product. With strict policies in place to meet requirements like GDPR and CCPA, best practices have become increasingly important and are continuously iterated on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Okta, Dovetail’s custom data retention was a game-changer and fit their compliance model. So much data was coming in from different sources, which had to be manually removed on a regular basis as soon as the raw data was no longer needed for functional purposes. Now, this process is automated. It’s clear when something is uploaded when the expiration date is, and the full value of the data can be extracted before deletion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous repository tools required a heavily manual process to turn access on and off for individual users. Now, the team saves time on tedious backend admin by creating user groups in Dovetail to implement and manage permissions at scale. At Okta, they believe provisioning access to folders or projects based on role or group is one of the fundamental tenets of how people get the most value out of a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A powerful home for an insightful roadmap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dovetail, Okta can finally consolidate all their research material in an accessible centralized repository where stakeholders can self-serve. Generating insights and making them durable and shareable throughout the organization has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okta’s custom home acts as a living document that is constantly updated. It sets the context of what Dovetail is and how the team uses it, shows how to get started and where to search, and directs stakeholders to finished insights reports and relevant projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search and feed blocks help the team get a sense of what’s new. Okta’s goal is to build a culture with Dovetail where people don’t wait for quarterly summaries but actively jump in and keep up to date—particularly for insights in their feature area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each quarter, the product teams identify areas to explore and work collaboratively to build roadmaps fuelled by insights. These insights are shared directly with the team, in Slack, or even turned into slides, which are then uploaded as PDFs back into Dovetail as valuable, searchable artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening Dovetail up at scale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 30 teams in Dovetail, and growing, democratization is a hot topic at Okta. They were searching for tools that supported a mix of methodologies for full-time researchers to anyone who came into contact with customers and had valuable insights to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now researchers, product managers, designers, and more are brought into analysis and even lead projects in Dovetail. Having the relevant help docs, supporting tutorials, and Dovetail templates help make running projects an approachable and repeatable process. The ability to become multi-player has been invaluable at Okta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail was like a welcoming front door when they opened it up to the whole product org—a custom home, easy navigation of projects, and a simple UI. The future at Okta looks like getting more stakeholders driving collaborative approaches to learning and research from all sources in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Make magic with your customer data in Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-dovetail-helps-you-make-magic-with-your-customer-data</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-dovetail-helps-you-make-magic-with-your-customer-data</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;No matter the industry you’re in, product teams of all shapes and sizes are faced with the same fundamental question every day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;What are we going to build next for our customers?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s iterating existing products and features to improve user experience, discovering ways to stand out in a competitive market, or just building the next big thing, everyone in the product team is constantly looking for the magic wand that helps them quickly understand how their customers and the market perceive their solutions so they can build the product strategy that helps their company win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there is plenty of data to help answer that question. Whether it’s customer calls, support tickets, usability testing, surveys, NPS scores, and more, there are plenty of ways you can listen to what your customer is saying. But how do you make sense of all of that data without drowning in spreadsheets? How do you avoid the pitfalls of recency bias without wasting valuable development cycles trying to gather and analyze disparate data sets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, Dovetail has been on a journey to become the customer insights hub for product teams - the single source of truth for all of your customer knowledge to help you build products people love. But just because all of your customer data lives in Dovetail doesn’t automatically make it useful. That’s why we have been focusing on delivering the magic wand your teams need to uncover the insights hidden in your messy customer data, and share them with stakeholders to drive alignment. In this blog we will explore the ways our solutions delivers on that promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dovetail helps you use magic to uncover insights faster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative customer interviews (such as sales calls, usability tests, and others) are a treasure trove of valuable insights. However, these data points are also the most time-intensive to analyze. It seems that every video conferencing solution can spit out a basic transcript, but the reality is that no one has the time to comb through these assets and pull out key themes and takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail got its start as a powerful transcription solution, but we have delivered more features that magically transform this unstructured data into the insights you need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you upload a call into Dovetail, you can generate a summary of the transcript, complete with timestamps that quickly bring you to the sections that matter most to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also introduced features that help reduce the time it takes to further analyze the rich data points that you uncover in your data. Magic cluster reviews all of the highlights in a canvas view, and using AI classifies them into thematic groups. Decrease the time you spend trying to make sense of highlights across various sources, and let Dovetail give you the map to finding the treasure lying buried in your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dovetail gives you the magic wand to align stakeholders on the voice of your customer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No good product decision was made in a silo. That’s why Dovetail is creating magic in not only the way you uncover insights in your data but also how you share those insights across a variety of teams and stakeholders to drive the alignment needed to successfully build and launch products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever wasted time trying to finesse all of your customer feedback into a consumable format? What if you could just let the customer speak for themselves? Dovetail lets you do that by magically stitching together video highlights and creating engaging reels that literally bring the voice of your customer to life. No video editing experience required!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve got this magic highlight reel, you need to be able to share it and meet your stakeholders where they are. Dovetail has built integrations that ensure those reels can still pack a punch with minimal effort. Quickly share highlight reels via our embed link, which makes them instantly playable in tools like Slack, Notion, or wherever your team works. No troubleshooting needed from your side, it’s just magic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about teams that need to ensure compliance with sensitive customer data? It can be even more time-intensive to redact transcripts and blur video, effectively creating a barrier to sharing those insights that are simply too high to scale. But not with Dovetail! Our magic redact capabilities magically give you the power of a seasoned video editor, and help you instantly blur videos and redact sections of your transcript so you don’t have to hold back valuable insights from the rest of your org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic redact is currently in an open beta for all customers on an Enterprise plan with Dovetail (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/beta-features/&quot;&gt;learn how to opt-in&lt;/a&gt;). If you are a current customer on any other plan, and interested in trying out magic redact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/contact/?type=ENTERPRISE_SALES&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=blog+post&amp;utm_campaign=magic_2024&quot;&gt;contact our sales team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;We are just getting started with the magic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this has been a great start, we have been listening to our customers who want to decrease the time spent on analyzing and sharing insights &lt;i&gt;even more&lt;/i&gt;. That’s why we are excited to harness the power of AI and ML technologies to magically transform the way our users:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlight key moments in call transcripts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sense of high-volume feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search all of their data in Dovetail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Present insights to align with key stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are excited to showcase what we have been up to in our first-ever community conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dvtl.link/43yuuPa&quot;&gt;Insight Out&lt;/a&gt;.

As a product manager, you need to create confidence for the right stakeholders, whether it’s in constructing a roadmap, meeting business objectives, or rallying the team to build the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer insights are the key to all your problems, and the secret sauce to the ultimate goal—delivering products that users love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a never-ending triage of tasks and competing priorities in your continuous product discovery, here are four ways Dovetail can get you to actionable insights, fast and help with your biggest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solving the right customer problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipping the right features for your customers is imperative. Finding product-market fit takes more than a gut feel. Eliminate the guesswork and validate your assumptions by uncovering concrete themes across all of your customer feedback to reveal jobs to be done, pain points, and sentiment shaping the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail helps you build your roadmap and tell a story with confidence using tangible customer insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connect Dovetail&lt;/b&gt; with your favorite tools and data to generate insights from the full picture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevate important points and key moments with &lt;b&gt;highlights and tags&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group and uncover customer themes in &lt;b&gt;canvas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tie all your data together in compelling &lt;b&gt;insights&lt;/b&gt;—and answer what to build next easily!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get to actionable insights, fast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your attention is being pulled in too many directions at once. From stakeholder meetings, product standups, to customer interviews—you’re working against the clock. Conducting robust user research takes time and you don’t want to cut corners to deliver results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streamline your workflow with a bit of Dovetail magic to get to reliable, actionable insights faster, and focus your efforts on more high-impact work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly &lt;b&gt;transcribe video and audio recordings &lt;/b&gt;to analyze from, and skip the manual note-taking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summarize&lt;/b&gt; key takeaways from interviews, feedback, and documents on the fly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sense of large amounts of data by &lt;b&gt;automatically clustering&lt;/b&gt; highlights by theme in canvas in seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t start from scratch with hundreds of &lt;b&gt;templates&lt;/b&gt; for you to kick off your project from&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Win over stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve built your roadmap, now comes the challenge of rallying the team, or even the company behind it. When customer knowledge is disjointed between sales, customer success, marketing, product, and anyone else with a customer touch point, there’s no single source of truth, and everyone has their own story about what the ‘right’ thing to build is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail helps your org share knowledge cross-functionally by bringing it all together. Influence stakeholders with evidence-backed insights that connect straight back to the source. Rally your team by amplifying the “why” behind the “what”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let your customers do the talking. Compile and share highlights as&lt;b&gt; a single powerful reel &lt;/b&gt;and get buy-in with compelling narratives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put your findings where they’ll pack a punch. &lt;b&gt;Embed highlights, insights, and reels&lt;/b&gt; into the tools your team already lives in—Slack, Notion, or Confluence, Jira, and Trello&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influence and align stakeholders with &lt;b&gt;magic summaries&lt;/b&gt;. Craft engaging overviews to hook readers into the insight before they dive deeper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scale your product intuition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landscape of your market is changing every day, so staying ahead of the curve is crucial. You want to build a growing library of customer insights so that you can scale your product intuition over time—and share it with your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is the customer insights hub that lets you do just that. Champion continuous product discovery by storing what you’ve learned and build on it with easy access to past data.

When faced with navigating emerging tech and shifting conditions, we did what we do best: relied on customers like you, alongside teams like Atlassian, Okta, Gitlab, Porsche, and Dyson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You told us you want to make sense of customer feedback faster, present insights in more engaging ways, and connect your insights hub across more teams and tools. With this, we set out to make Dovetail faster, more connected, and more secure than ever before. We want every team—from one-person startups to the world’s largest organizations—to have the insights they need to make better decisions to build what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on for a recap of what we released over the past 12 months, and get excited for some of the biggest ever changes to Dovetail landing this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making magic ✨&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can’t write a product update in 2024 without mentioning the elephant in the room! We can confirm we have spent &lt;i&gt;a lot &lt;/i&gt;of time working with customers to define how we integrate AI into Dovetail. We didn’t want to bolt it on, rather, we wanted AI to weave seamlessly into how you work, reducing the time it takes to go from messy, unstructured data to a summarized, sharable insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our customers told us they need more insights, but finding connections in data still takes too long. We introduced &lt;b&gt;magic cluster &lt;/b&gt;in canvas to help you uncover themes automatically. Try it when you want to get a head start on your analysis or uncover big ideas you might have missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We heard you want to share quick takeaways with your team moments after you finish a call. Introducing &lt;b&gt;magic summarize &lt;/b&gt;that transforms customer conversations and insights into instantly digestible outputs&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Keep your team connected to the customer without them having to dig through long transcripts and endless highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flexible, fast analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You told us you want to get more use out of the documents and presentation decks you store in your insights hub. Now it’s possible to &lt;b&gt;highlight and tag documents&lt;/b&gt; in Dovetail to bolster your customer insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know you like canvas—it’s by far the most popular view in Dovetail. But you want it to be &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;. You want highlights organized in a way that matches your mental model. &lt;b&gt;Groups in canvas &lt;/b&gt;helps you organize your highlights, making your work more accessible to you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers from around the world asked us to improve transcription. Now, there are an additional &lt;b&gt;ten transcription languages&lt;/b&gt; with automatic language detection, including Vietnamese and Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create engaging insights &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to share insights, Dovetail makes it easy to create engaging, delightful, and consumable outputs. Focus your team on what matters to build a customer-first culture and drive the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help your team get straight to the point by &lt;b&gt;simplifying references&lt;/b&gt; in insights. Now you can ensure your team has just the right amount of context by hiding bits you don’t need, like text and tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We heard you ask for improvements to how your team navigates to insights. Now you can surface &lt;b&gt;published insights in folders&lt;/b&gt;. That means your team no longer needs to dig into a project to find that golden nugget to steer their next product decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Connect the tools you love&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t want anything to get in the way of your team connecting with your customers. That’s why we&amp;#39;ve been working hard to make Dovetail more connected to the tools your team use and love every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;b&gt;eight new integrations&lt;/b&gt; like Notion, Jira, Confluence, and Productboard, your insights hub is plugged into the way you work. Instantly import interviews and files from Teams or OneDrive. Then, share the insights directly in Confluence, Notion,  Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your team doesn’t have time to jump around to find the latest insights. Now they won’t have to—because sharing the important bits got a whole lot better with &lt;b&gt;playable highlights embeds&lt;/b&gt; in Slack, Confluence, Jira, Trello, Notion, and Microsoft Teams. Your team can connect with their customers easily while still being able to trace back to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scale insights across your organization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is the insights hub for the world’s largest organizations. To support our growing enterprise customer base, we’ve made our product even more secure, safe, and scalable to support our largest customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magic redact&lt;/b&gt; lets you redact video&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to hide faces and names, silence audio, and remove sensitive information from transcripts.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Analyze participant expressions before sharing securely with your team. For our larger customers, this is our most requested feature of the past 12 months!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We heard that as your organization scales, you need a way to keep insights organized. Clean up your projects and organize them in a way that reflects your team structure by creating &lt;b&gt;folders within folders&lt;/b&gt;. Combined with new user groups, you’ll be able to maintain control over sensitive data at a project or folder level across your whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know you need to keep some projects private. Now you can add or revoke access to many users at once. Organize your &lt;b&gt;user groups&lt;/b&gt; in a way that works for you—this could be by team, project, or level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if your team uses Okta, you can now automate user provisioning with our latest &lt;b&gt;SCIM integration&lt;/b&gt;. This means you can centralize user permission updates and streamline onboarding and off-boarding. Microsft Azure is coming next—so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GDPR is important for our European customers. It’s easier than ever to adhere to GDPR with our &lt;b&gt;new EU data region&lt;/b&gt;. When you create a new workspace, you can choose where you want to store your data, in the US or EU. Our European data region is part of an ongoing commitment to security and compliance that includes a SOC 2 Type II report, and our HIPAA-compliant solution for storing sensitive healthcare data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supporting our community&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no one way to organize customer insights. That’s why we’re connecting customer-obsessed product people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many approaches to organizing customer insights across teams, we’re always being asked for best practices and a peek into how other teams use Dovetail. We launched the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://dvtl.link/3uOW0uD&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dovetail community&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—a first-of-its-kind marketplace for you to exchange and learn different approaches to uncover customer insights. Find and try hundreds of project templates, insight templates, and tag boards from Dovetail and leading teams like Kickstarter, Maze, and Sprig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dvtl.link/3OYgqIu&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dovetail Academy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for you to learn best practices, tips, and tricks whether you’re just getting started or a power user. Plus, a brand new &lt;b&gt;champion program&lt;/b&gt; to nurture leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The year ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product people want to find answers to customer questions fast. They shouldn’t have to wade through tonnes of meaningless data to get there. They shouldn’t have to speak to everyone in a customer-facing role across the organization. And anyone on the team should be able to do it—not just specialist researchers and experienced designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, our mission is to make it possible for all teams to immerse themselves in customer insights. From faster, lightweight analysis to improved discovery, it will be easier than ever to uncover customer insights and find answers across teams and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re making magic. And you’re invited to see it at Insight Out—our first global conference for customer-obsessed product people.

Dovetail&amp;#39;s Canvas view lets you affinity map in the same place your research lives. Here&amp;#39;s how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gather your data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step one is to gather your data: survey responses, interviews, customer feedback, or any other qualitative research you may have done. Make sure you collect enough data to get a good sense of the patterns that may exist. Combining data sources leads to a deeper analysis and a more nuanced understanding of user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlight and tag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags and highlights structure data that would otherwise be difficult to interpret. Tagging in Dovetail is incredibly simple—for a complete walkthrough, click &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/highlight-and-tag-project-content/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set up your Canvas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your data has been highlighted and tagged, set up your Canvas in Dovetail. To create a Canvas view, click &lt;b&gt;Add a view&lt;/b&gt; under &lt;b&gt;Highlights&lt;/b&gt; and select &lt;b&gt;Canvas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affinity map your data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your canvas is set up, start grouping related highlights into clusters. It’s easy to make this a group exercise—Canvas view supports collaboration with unlimited teammates as long as they have a Contributor or Manager account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a quick start on your synthesis. Clicking &lt;b&gt;Smart Arrange&lt;/b&gt; will automatically group your highlights by &lt;b&gt;Tag&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Note.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refining your clusters from here is as simple as dragging and dropping highlights into new or different groups. To get started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify the types of insights you want to cluster. Are you looking for patterns in user behavior, attitudes, or preferences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read through your data and make the first pass at grouping similar highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create named themes for the different groups you have identified. You can add labels using the &lt;b&gt;Text &lt;/b&gt;button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each theme, consider if it relates to others. If applicable, simplify further by grouping these similar themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have identified the different clusters, add visual representation. Provide clear visual borders between groups by using the &lt;b&gt;Rectangle &lt;/b&gt;tool, or add labels to each theme by clicking the &lt;b&gt;Text&lt;/b&gt; button. This will help you better understand the relationships between your themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summarise patterns into insights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve organized your data, it&amp;#39;s time to summarize it into insights. Select a theme, and click &lt;b&gt;Add to insight.&lt;/b&gt; This newly created insight will contain all of the highlights in your theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights are important, and a great insight can radically update how stakeholders see the world. When creating insights, it can be helpful to follow a few principles. At Dovetail, we believe that insights should be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surprising.&lt;/b&gt; If everybody immediately nods their head, it isn’t an insight. Insights should reveal something that wasn&amp;#39;t previously known or expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Empirical. &lt;/b&gt;Insights should be grounded in data, not subjective bias. This allows stakeholders to draw conclusions based on the evidence rather than relying on intuition or guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple.&lt;/b&gt; Insights should be written in plain English—direct and free of jargon. Simple writing builds trust, as the reader is more likely to trust you if the message is easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tailored. &lt;/b&gt;Insights should be written with your specific audience in mind. By understanding your stakeholders and their needs, you can tailor your writing to be more persuasive and engaging, making it easier for them to understand and act on your message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recommendation-based.&lt;/b&gt; Without a clear recommendation, it can be challenging to understand what should be done with your insights. Recommendations provide a framework and actionable steps to address the issue, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share your results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it&amp;#39;s time to share your results with the rest of your team. You can share your insights directly with stakeholders or by using the Dovetail Slack integration. Alternatively, share your raw affinity diagram with your team or stakeholders to review and discuss. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to understanding user needs, preferences, experiences, and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affinity mapping is an invaluable tool for any researcher or analyst. With Dovetail&amp;#39;s Canvas View, you can quickly and easily visualize your data and uncover valuable insights. Following the six steps outlined above, you can make the most of the tool and get the most out of your research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail in the Details: 21 improvements to influence, transcribe, and store]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-the-details-21-improvements-to-influence-transcribe-and-store</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-the-details-21-improvements-to-influence-transcribe-and-store</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’re wrapping up the year with twenty-one early Christmas presents. In this edition of Dovetail in the Details, I’ll be sharing little but powerful changes to help insights pack a punch, connect Dovetail to your workflow, and transcribe smoother than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the best things come in small packages, so let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Influential insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to inspiring your team to solve customer problems, Dovetail insights are key. We’ve made formatting engaging insights easier. Plus, it’s now more accessible for your team to track and discover their next insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Content added to insights will automatically sit in a layout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Published insights are now non-editable by default&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Discover more insights at the bottom of published insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Discover following published insights more easily with a new bell icon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Unfurl Dovetail links as reference cards in insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. View all published insights within a specific folders’ projects*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Insights where you work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t let anything get in the way of your team and the customer. Bring insights to where your team already work with more powerful previews and integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Unfurl links in Dovetail from Google Drive, Miro, Mural, and Notion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Get a more detailed text preview of Dovetail highlights in Notion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Play highlights in Slack, Notion, Microsoft Teams, and Atlassian tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Create a new note straight from Slack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The smoothest transcription experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every moment between your conversation and analysis risks valuable insights slipping through the cracks. Don’t waste time trying to recollect your thoughts by analyzing in Dovetail right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. Video captions are always legible as they scale to window size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. We’ll auto-detect language for transcription&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13. 10+ new transcription languages launched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14. Transcribe files automatically when imported into a note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Powerful projects and folders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your projects tidy and organised for you and your team. We’ve made navigating between projects and folders easier and more intuative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15. Don’t lose your scroll position when your return to a project or folder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16. Choose which folder you want to install a blank project or template into&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17. Pinned projects have a fresh, clean new look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18. Managers can pin folders in a workspace for everyone to find&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But that’s not all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;19. Quickly join a new workspace when opening a shared link&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20. New “Your work” page to access recent and favorite projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21.

You empower everyone in your organization to deliver and scale the research craft—from researchers to designers, to PMs, to anyone who comes into contact with the customer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All your work happens in the background seamlessly, but its impact is crucial. Tooling, enablement, governance, insight management, and advocacy are some key responsibilities, but as the team scales, so do the challenges. We’ve got solutions for each key problem you’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stop repeating research, centralize all your data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’ve got customer interviews, NPS scores, survey responses, and more stretched across different tools, insights can slip through the cracks—research gets lost, and it gets repeated. Your team’s valuable time and resources are wasted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centralize all research data in Dovetail to build a rich and growing repository of knowledge that the team can continuously learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curate and store all your customer data in one with &lt;b&gt;projects, insights, and notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never lose anything again with &lt;b&gt;search&lt;/b&gt;. Use filters to surface relevant current and past research data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make information accessible and easy to find. Organize and structure your workspace with &lt;b&gt;folders&lt;/b&gt; to reflect the way your team works best&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Empower your team with standardized practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many customer conversations happening—things can get out of hand quickly. Trying to make sense of inconsistent notes, feedback, and insights only adds more to your team’s plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By standardizing research practices, you can provide guidance and structure to empower new starters, streamline analysis, and improve the quality of outputs. Build a strong foundation for your team to produce robust findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a clear tagging structure and system for your team. Create custom &lt;b&gt;workspace fields and tags&lt;/b&gt; that span across your projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get started on the right foot with &lt;b&gt;Dovetail templates&lt;/b&gt;. Standardize research across your team quickly by setting up templates for projects and insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Show research value with stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your team is doing amazing work, and you want people to know it. Research shouldn’t be happening in silos. You need to ensure your team has the right support to make their valuable insights engaging, discoverable, and impactful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give stakeholders &lt;b&gt;insights&lt;/b&gt; in a digestible, customizable format. Embed compelling references to data from the analysis or past findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let your customers do the talking with &lt;b&gt;highlight reels&lt;/b&gt;. Your team can compile and share highlights as a single powerful video for stakeholders to watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give insights the attention they deserve and keep stakeholders up-to-date. Put findings where they’ll stick with our &lt;b&gt;Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Atlassian integrations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show the impact of your team’s work with &lt;b&gt;insight metrics and workspace analytics&lt;/b&gt;. Discover what’s resonating and track output over time—from projects to notes, highlights, tags, insights, and people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unblock blockers to meet security and compliance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want the best tools for your team, but they have to meet certain standards. Here’s how Dovetail unblocks security and data blockers so you don’t have to compromise on anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streamline access with built-in &lt;b&gt;single sign-on&lt;/b&gt; capabilities for Google and Microsoft accounts. Plus, the option to configure your own managed identity provider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comply with your internal data policies with &lt;b&gt;custom data retention&lt;/b&gt;. Set up auto-deletion of original videos without losing the video highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet &lt;b&gt;HIPAA compliance&lt;/b&gt; with access controls and features to manage PHI, such as advanced restrictions on sharing, access, and data exporting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unblock local regulations by choosing to &lt;b&gt;store your customer data in the USA or EU &lt;/b&gt;when creating a new workspace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tools that scale with the team—manage workspaces efficiently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing the team from one to many is a task in itself, you need a tool that scales with you. Access and permissions should work hand-in-hand with the way your company already operates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how we can help speed up that process, give stakeholders the right access at the right time, and eliminate some of your administrative burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save time and grant access in bulk by organizing &lt;b&gt;users into groups&lt;/b&gt;—by team, project, or level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage all your permissions from one place with our &lt;b&gt;SCIM integration&lt;/b&gt;. Automate user provisioning and streamline your onboarding and off-boarding process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create the perfect landing experience. Direct stakeholders to relevant insights, highlights, and projects from your &lt;b&gt;custom home and feeds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give your team the best of the best, and try Dovetail today.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engaging insights in minutes: launching five new features to speed up analysis]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/engaging-insights-in-minutes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/engaging-insights-in-minutes</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are two types of insights. Deep customer insights help you generate ideas and inspire innovation. Fast customer insights give you a pulse check on customer problems. Both motivate your team toward an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is the customer insights hub that makes deep customer insights easier—and fast insights possible. Today, I’ll walk through how to go from raw data to insights in minutes with five new features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your highlights organized with &lt;b&gt;groups in canvas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streamline references by &lt;b&gt;hiding tags, text, and video&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip the setup with &lt;b&gt;insight templates&lt;/b&gt; from the Dovetail community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make insights easily discoverable by &lt;b&gt;adding insights to folders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share&lt;b&gt; playable highlights &lt;/b&gt;in the tools your team already use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From data to insights in three minutes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketers love making claims about fast analysis. From “data to insights in minutes, not hours” to “save 10 days on analysis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know it’s possible to make an insight in minutes in Dovetail, but—what kind of insight? What would it be useful for, and how might you use them in your work? Today, we’re testing fast insights. Three minutes starts now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Automatically identify themes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I’m a product manager analyzing user feedback. First up, I import my CSV file. &lt;b&gt;Automatic sentiment analysis&lt;/b&gt; neatly groups them into positive and negative themes. We’re 40 seconds down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On canvas, &lt;b&gt;automatic clustering&lt;/b&gt; groups my highlights by theme. Now, I can select a group and quickly create an insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summarize key takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the insight easily digestible, I create an &lt;b&gt;automatic summary&lt;/b&gt;, then surface the insight for my team by hitting publish, and sharing a link in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The result—a fast insight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All up, it took just under three minutes and here’s what we’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Insights that go deeper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about when you need to get to the root of a customer problem or influence a strategic decision? Imagine you’re looking to get buy-in for next quarter’s roadmap. You’ll want to spend a little more time building a story that not only reflects your customer’s needs, goals, and pains but connects with your team too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don’t start from scratch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packaging up your insights in a clear way that motivates your team takes time. After you’ve played around with formatting and content, you’re wondering if there’s a better way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you don’t need to start with a blank insight. Try an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/insights&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;insight template&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Dovetail community for user insights, customer success stories, survey results, and more. You can skip the setup, build confidence, and take inspiration from the Dovetail team and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;Team plan and above&lt;/a&gt;, create &lt;b&gt;workspace insight templates&lt;/b&gt; just for your team to guide and standardize their approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Focus your team on what matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can focus stakeholders on what’s important by &lt;b&gt;simplifying references&lt;/b&gt; in insights. When you reference highlights, you can ensure your team has just the right amount of context by hiding bits you don’t need, like text and tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make insights easy to find&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you create and layer customer insights, they have the potential to paint a better picture of your customer, covering more perspectives over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made them easier to find by &lt;b&gt;surfacing published insights in folders&lt;/b&gt;. That means your team no longer needs to dig around projects to find that golden nugget to steer their next product decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, sharing the important bits is about to get a whole lot better with &lt;b&gt;playable highlights embeds&lt;/b&gt; in Slack, Confluence, Jira, Trello, Notion, and Microsoft Teams. Your team will be able to connect with their customers easily while still being able to trace back to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes, you need fast insights. Other times, you need deep insights. Dovetail is here to help you create, manage, and share both.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Try Dovetail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; for free today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Built to scale: introducing video blurring plus four more features for security and collaboration ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/built-to-scale</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/built-to-scale</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep customer understanding is the secret weapon of the world’s leading organizations. But on the way to creating a customer-first culture, it’s important that your team is equipped with the right tools to do it in a secure, collaborative, and accessible way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Starbucks to Volkswagen, Atlassian, and Shopify—Dovetail is the customer insight hub of choice for organizations looking to scale their research efforts and create a culture built around their customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we outlined a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-2023/#a-scalable-standardized-insights-hub&quot;&gt;vision for the future of customer research&lt;/a&gt;. At the heart of this vision was a new way for large organizations to experience the compounding benefits of a customer insights hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re excited to share what we’ve been working on. From user groups that allow you to manage permissions across large teams to protecting PII by blurring video, Dovetail just got a lot more powerful for organizations looking to scale and standardize customer insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empower your team with these five new features built for scaling customer understanding. Plus, hold on to the end, where we’ll let you in on an exciting feature in closed beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unlock access to insights at scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing permissions across multiple large teams, functions, and projects drains your time away from doing more important things. So we’ve made it easier to manage permissions while protecting sensitive projects and PII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add or revoke access to many users at once by creating &lt;b&gt;user groups&lt;/b&gt;. Organize your user groups in a way that works for you—this could be by team, project, or level. It’s a simple way to ensure everyone has access to important projects while keeping others locked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if your team uses Okta, you can now automate user provisioning with our latest &lt;b&gt;System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) &lt;/b&gt;integration. This means you can centralize user permission updates and streamline onboarding and off-boarding. Microsft Azure is coming next—so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tailor your stakeholder experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know you’ve been asking for a better stakeholder experience so that your team can come in, explore, and uncover customer insights. Create a culture of curiosity with new features that make organizing projects and surfacing findings simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean up your projects and organize them in a way that reflects your team structure by creating&lt;b&gt; folders within folders&lt;/b&gt;. Combined with new user groups, you’ll be able to maintain control over sensitive data at a project or folder level across your whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back by popular demand—&lt;b&gt;feeds&lt;/b&gt;! Ensure stakeholders’ first experience of your insights hub packs a punch. Feeds allow you to direct stakeholders to relevant insights, projects, and highlights in your teams’ custom home. Team members can even hit follow to get instant updates in Dovetail, Slack, or by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Store your data in Europe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made GDPR compliance easier than ever for our European customers with a new data region based in Ireland. When you create a new workspace, you can choose where you want to store your data—in the US or EU. 

Our European data region is part of an ongoing commitment to security and compliance that includes a SOC 2 Type II report, and our HIPAA compliant solution for storing sensitive healthcare data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protect PII by blurring video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming soon, you’ll be able to protect participants’ privacy by&lt;b&gt; blurring videos to hide faces and names, and redact sensitive information from transcripts. &lt;/b&gt;Analyze participant expressions before sharing securely with your team. This will be rolling out to all Enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;These new features are available to customers on our Business and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/scale/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; plans—with the exception of video blurring and SCIM, which are Enterprise-only. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/contact/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Speak to our team&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; about upgrading to scale insights across your whole organization.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail in the details: 24 improvements to automate, tag, and share]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-the-details-24-improvements-to-automate-tag-and-share</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-the-details-24-improvements-to-automate-tag-and-share</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another edition of Dovetail in the details—your go-to place to discover all the small but mighty improvements we’ve made to our product, in hopes of helping you build better products too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, our powerful customer insights hub just got even more powerful, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ai/&quot;&gt;new AI features&lt;/a&gt; for you to play with.

Here are three ways it might come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Save time on BAU: &lt;/b&gt;dragging your feet while writing research summaries? Now these tedious tasks don’t have to be as time-consuming or manual. Automatically generate a paragraph or bullet summary of your transcripts, documents, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Level up your deliverable game: &lt;/b&gt;don’t wait until the end of your project to showcase your progress. Share more outputs by creating concise summaries of your interviews, feedback, and more so that stakeholders can quickly reference and grab takeaways before you’ve reached the final report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Influence with summaries: &lt;/b&gt;mold your words to impact by automating first, then tweaking the output. Craft engaging overviews to hook stakeholders into the insight before they dive in deeper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, there’s more. Here are three features to drive stakeholder buy-in home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Straight from the customer’s mouth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add some extra oomph to your insights with reels.

Playback evidence for your team to build confidence in what they’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Invite everyone to the party&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nowhere to hide from insights with easy sharing. If you’ve got a juicy insight, highlight, or note, now you’re able to send it directly to a team member, whether they’ve got a Dovetail account or not. You can even make an insight public so everyone can join in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Never miss a thing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have stakeholders follow projects to keep them up-to-date and insights front of mind. Get notifications via Slack or in-product every time a new insight is published or comments are left. Start getting more eyeballs across the research and spark important conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ai/&quot;&gt;newest AI features&lt;/a&gt; are here to help streamline your process and get stakeholder buy-in at every step of the way. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uncover themes faster than ever in canvas, now with AI clustering]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/uncover-themes-faster-than-ever-in-canvas-now-with-ai-clustering</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/uncover-themes-faster-than-ever-in-canvas-now-with-ai-clustering</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding themes from your interviews, usability tests, and feedback can be overwhelming. It’s hard to know where to start. And once you’ve started, tricky to retain the important parts needed to find connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail can help with that. Now you can harness the power of machine learning to find themes for you. Read on to learn about AI clustering and three other features that will help you uncover themes in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uncover themes in seconds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kick off your affinity mapping process by automatically clustering highlights by theme in canvas. Here are three ways to leverage AI thematic clustering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Themes to action: &lt;/b&gt;working against the clock? Cluster your interview highlights and feedback around common themes in just moments. Auto-generated titles will appear to describe each cluster which you can then transform into insights and roadmap items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Discover new ideas: &lt;/b&gt;if you’re worried that you might have missed a trend or two, recluster as many times as you’d like and let AI suggest new groups, patterns, and perspectives to compare. Control the breadth and depth of your clustering by adjusting how broad or specific you want your themes and how rigidly highlights should be assigned to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Dive in deeper: &lt;/b&gt;have full control of all your outputs and craft quality, granular clusters. Start by grouping with AI, then go more in-depth by manually breaking down and further refining these clusters—exposing powerful and instructive themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three extra features to help you get from highlights to insights in as little as seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drill down on themes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give a method to the madness by structuring your synthesis with filters. By applying filters across multiple canvas views based on fields, tags, date created, and more, you can analyze highlights by month, product, customer type, phase of the user journey, and any other category to streamline the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Find exactly what you’re looking for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember a keyword, pain point, or topic that came up several times? Use &lt;b&gt;Search&lt;/b&gt; in the toolbar to find every relevant highlight and group them under a single tag with bulk tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turn clusters into insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate insights the moment you spot trends. Bulk select your grouped highlights and click &lt;b&gt;Add to insight&lt;/b&gt; to send them straight to an existing or new insight. Now you’re ready to present and put them into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ai/&quot;&gt;more machine learning technology into Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; to help you get to insights in record time. Stay tuned for exciting features on the horizon, and uncover themes faster than ever today.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The qualitative research process, end-to-end]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/the-qualitative-research-process-end-to-end</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/the-qualitative-research-process-end-to-end</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;The qualitative research process: step by step guide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although research processes may vary by methodology or project team, some fundamentals exist across research projects. Below outlines the collective experience that qualitative researchers undertake to conduct research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Determine what to research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in doing research is determining what to research. Researchers will look through any product roadmaps, strategy documents, data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/customer-research/customer-feedback-analysis/&quot;&gt;customer feedback&lt;/a&gt;, and conversations with stakeholders to identify potential knowledge gaps or research opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a researcher has determined a list of potential projects to tackle, they will prioritize projects based on the business&amp;#39;s impact, available resourcing, timelines &amp;amp; dependencies to create a research roadmap. For each project, they will also identify the key questions they need to answer in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher should identify the participants they plan to research, and any key attributes that are a &amp;#39;must-have&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;nice to have&amp;#39; as these can be influential in determining the research approach (e.g. a niche group may require a longer timeline to recruit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will generally aim for a mix of project types. Some may be more tactical or requests from stakeholders, and some will be projects that the researcher has proactively identified as opportunities for strategic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Identify how to research it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researcher has finalized the research project, they will need to figure out how they will do the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the researcher will look through secondary data and research (e.g. analytics, previous research reports). Secondary analysis will help determine if there are existing answers to any of the open questions, ensuring that any net-new study doesn&amp;#39;t duplicate current work (unless previous research is out of date).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After scoping the research, researchers will determine if the research input needs to be &lt;b&gt;attitudinal&lt;/b&gt; (i.e. what someone says) or &lt;b&gt;behavioral&lt;/b&gt; (i.e. what someone does); as well as if they need to &lt;b&gt;explore&lt;/b&gt; a problem space or &lt;b&gt;evaluate&lt;/b&gt; a product – these help &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/research/mixed-methods-research/&quot;&gt;determine the methodology&lt;/a&gt; to use. There are many methodologies out there, but the main ones you generally will find from a qualitative perspective are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interviews &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Attitudinal / Exploratory]&lt;/i&gt; – semi-structured conversation with a participant focused on a small set of topics. Runs for 30-60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contextual Inquiry &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Behavioral / Exploratory]&lt;/i&gt; – observation of a participant in their environment. Probing questions may be asked during the observation. Runs for 2-3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Attitudinal / Evaluative]&lt;/i&gt; – gathering structured information from a sample of people, traditionally to generalize the results to a larger population. Surveys should generally not take participants more than 10 minutes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usability Test &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Behavioral / Evaluative]&lt;/i&gt; – evaluating how representative users are, or are not, able to achieve critical tasks within an experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out these articles for more information about different methodologies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/&quot;&gt;When to Use Which User-Experience Research Methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;UX Research Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usability.gov/&quot;&gt;Usability.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.design/design-research-kit-fed36125a713&quot;&gt;Design Research Kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Get buy-in and alignment from others&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a researcher has determined what they will be researching and how they will research it, they will generally write up a research plan that includes additional information about the research goals, participant scope, timelines, and dependencies. The plan is typically either a document or presentation shared with stakeholders depending on the company and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the research plan is complete, researchers will share the plan for feedback and input from their stakeholders to ensure that the stakeholders have the right expectations going into the research. Stakeholders may ask for additional question topics to be added, ensure that research will be executed against specific timelines, or provide recommendations on how the study will help make product decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At organizations where there is a research team, researchers may also share their plan with other researchers informally or through a &amp;#39;crit&amp;#39; process. Generally, researchers will provide feedback on the research craft, such as methodologies, participant mixes, and the research goals or questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researcher feels confident in their plan, they will either begin to plan the research, or in the case of more junior researchers, get approval from their manager to begin the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Prepare research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step is where the researcher will get all of their ducks in a row to execute the research. Preparation activities include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equipment:&lt;/b&gt; Booking venues, labs, observation rooms, and procuring any appropriate equipment needed to run the study (e.g. cameras, mobile devices).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants:&lt;/b&gt; Sourcing participants from internal / external databases, reaching out/scheduling participants, managing schedule changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incentives:&lt;/b&gt; Find budget, identify incentive type (e.g. Amazon gift card? customer credit? gift baskets), and purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assets:&lt;/b&gt; Building relevant designs / prototypes (with design or design technologists), creating interview / observation guides and other research tools needed for sessions (e.g. physical cards for in-person card sorts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legal &amp;amp; Procurement: &lt;/b&gt;Participant waivers or NDAs preparation to ensure they are sent in advance of the research session to participants, vendor procurement, and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Research Operations exists within an organization, they will generally take on most of the load in this area. The researcher will focus on assets required for executing research, such as interview guides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, vendors may be engaged for some of these requirements (e.g. labs, participants, and incentive management) if resourcing is not available internally or if a researcher wants a blinded study (i.e. the participant doesn&amp;#39;t know what company is running the research). In this case, additional time is incorporated to brief, onboard, and get approvals to work with the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Execute research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the researcher gets to research!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will generally aim to execute research activities for 1–2 weeks, depending on the methodology to ensure they can be efficient in execution. In some more longitudinal methods (e.g., diary studies), or if a participant type is harder to recruit, it may take longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In consumer research, there will usually be back up participants available in case of no shows. However, in business or enterprise research, researchers will engage will all recruited participants as participants will generally have relationships with other parts of the company (e.g. sales). It is essential to maintain those relationships post-research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sessions, in a perfect world, there is one facilitator (principal researcher). In some cases, a secondary attendee who takes notes – this can be a stakeholder or a more junior researcher who can then learn soft skills from the primary researcher. By delegating note-taking, the principal researcher can focus on driving and managing the participant&amp;#39;s conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in most cases (especially if there is a &amp;quot;research team of one&amp;quot;), researchers will try to have to do both facilitation and documentation – this can lead to a clunkier conversation as the facilitator attempts to quickly write notes between trying to think of the next question. If a researcher decides to record a session instead, they will have to spend additional time after the research listening to the full recordings and writing notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In qualitative research, researchers may begin to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/&quot;&gt;see patterns in the findings after five sessions&lt;/a&gt;. They may start to tailor the research questions to be more specific to gaps in their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers may also set up an observation room for stakeholders (or share links to remote sessions) to attend live. Generally, researchers will have a backchannel (e.g., slack, chat, or SMS), so if a stakeholder has a follow-up question to an answer, the researcher can dig deeper. In some cases, researchers will give stakeholders an input form to take their notes that can be shared with the researcher afterward - this can be useful for the researcher to understand how the stakeholder views the research and what the stakeholder perceives as necessary to the research insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 6: Synthesize and find insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the research capture is complete, the researcher will then aggregate findings to begin to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/research/thematic-analysis/&quot;&gt;look for common themes&lt;/a&gt; (in exploratory) or success rates (in evaluative). Both of these will then lead to insight generation that researchers will then look to tie back to the project&amp;#39;s original research goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As analysis can be one of the most high-effort tasks in research, researchers will lean towards how to be efficient in their study, generally using digital tools, hacks, or workarounds. Researchers will usually create the analysis process they refine throughout their careers to help them become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where researchers are looking to get buy-in for research or capture stakeholder input, they may seem to more visual approaches (e.g. post-it affinity analysis) in war rooms. This process can take longer to process (especially if there is a high volume of data). Still, there can be a higher impact on analyzing research in this way – especially if the researcher is looking to get buy-in for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 7: Create research outputs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a researcher identifies the key themes and insights, the researcher will reframe these findings to a relevant research output to ensure that stakeholders understand and buy-in to the outcomes. Outputs may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Report:&lt;/b&gt; Outlines vital findings from research in a document or presentation format. Will most likely include an executive summary, insight themes, and supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Videos:&lt;/b&gt; A highlight reel of supporting evidence from crucial findings. Generally seen as more useful and engaging compared to just a report. In most cases, the video will help the research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ux/what-is-a-persona/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;A written representation of a product&amp;#39;s intended users to understand different types of user goals, needs, and behaviors. Also used to help stakeholders build empathy for the end-user of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ux/journey-map/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journey Map&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;A visualization of the process that a person goes through to accomplish a goal. Generally created in conjunction with a persona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concepts / Wireframes / Designs:&lt;/b&gt; If research is evaluative, designs can visualize recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Storyboarding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a researcher makes the output, researchers will spend time planning the structure and storyboarding. Storyboarding is incredibly essential to help researchers define information requirements and ensure they present their findings in the most impactful way to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Having a point of view in outputs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, researchers have tried to stay neutral to the data and not try to have a strong opinion or perspective to let the data speak. However, as researchers become more embedded in the industry, this has shifted to stakeholders wanting a strong point of view or recommendations from researchers that can help other stakeholders (especially product managers and designers) decide the knowledge captured as part of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a strong perspective helps researchers have a seat at the table and appear as a trusted advisor/partner in cross-functional settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 8: Share and follow up on findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the research outputs are complete, some researchers will do a &amp;quot;pre-share&amp;quot; or walkthrough with key stakeholders or potential detractors to the research. The purpose of these meetings is to align with stakeholders&amp;#39; expectations and find potential &amp;#39;watch-outs&amp;#39; (things that may derail a presentation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will generally have to share their findings out multiple times to different stakeholder groups and tailor them for each audience. For example, executive meetings will be more higher level than a meeting with a product manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After sharing, researchers will follow up with key stakeholders (especially those who provided input to the research) to confirm they understand the findings and identify next steps. Next steps may include incorporating results in product strategy documents, proposals / PRDs, or user stories to ensure that the recommendations or findings have been reflected or sourced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[11 common challenges you face as a researcher]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/11-common-challenges-you-face-as-a-researcher</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/11-common-challenges-you-face-as-a-researcher</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As much as I love being a researcher, we experience some challenges when we try to lead research. Below I will share some of the common pain points other researchers, and I have faced within our roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the problems faced by researchers during research?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Research is slow and expensive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research as a separate team is relatively new compared to engineering, product, or design, many stakeholders may not have worked with researchers in the past and understand the value that a researcher can bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because some research methodologies take time to execute or require external vendor support to get the best insight, there are perceptions that research is slow or expensive and will be a barrier or blocker in building or shipping products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These can lead to research not being included in product conversations early, or at all, limiting the ability for analysis to provide strategic or directional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other cases it may lead to research not getting the right budget to effectively perform their work, leading to researchers having to be scrappy, hacky and de-prioritize research that may take up a significant percentage of their budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Research teams of one, or silos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When research is not valued, organizations will not invest in a group. Many organizations will have an individual researcher across the entire company or multiple product areas, which can strain the researcher to rigorously prioritize what projects they work on and lead to frustrations with other teams if they are not getting research support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where research teams exist, researchers may be embedded in discrete or separate product areas, making it hard for researchers to collaborate or pair with other researchers on projects. When researchers come together to attend crit or share feedback and experiences, researchers spend time setting the context of what they&amp;#39;re working on with peers (especially in non-consumer facing experiences) to ensure peers can provide meaningful feedback to support their projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Research execution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, after a researcher has spent the time and effort creating a robust research report, it isn&amp;#39;t used. A research report is usually not used because of a mismatch in expectations of the stakeholder and researcher. Researchers need to ensure that stakeholders are taken along the research creation journey to ensure there is alignment and buy-in from stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, researchers may &amp;quot;throw research over the fence&amp;quot; in that they may not invest the effort in creating research outputs that resonate with stakeholders or take the time to have conversations and presentations with stakeholders to open a dialogue about the research and help the stakeholder understand how to leverage the research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Research not used&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other cases, product priorities may have shifted, or new dependencies now prevent the research findings from being integrated into products and design. Inaction on research can make it harder for researchers to feel like they impact their team when their work doesn&amp;#39;t create change in the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers must determine other ways to generate value from the work that they have done. Value might be in the form of looking for broader opportunities to share findings outside of the direct stakeholder team or share with their research team, where outputs have the chance to be used for related work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Too much effort to add and search for previous work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can spend a lot of time looking for past research or data to support a stakeholder or research project. Because researchers have to quickly jump from one project to another to ensure they can continually provide value, &amp;#39;meta work&amp;#39; such as knowledge management is usually deprioritized in the research process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers may actively try to stay up to date with knowledge management activities. As each researcher may have a different mental model for how to tag and store insights, other researchers can find it difficult to find research unless they know the right search keywords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the format a researcher presents in (such as a presentation or report), it will be the same format that it is stored. An inconsistent storage format can be hard for future researchers to parse for insights, leading researchers to have to go through every individual report on a topic to determine if there are relevant insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Service model requests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although stakeholders are critical to ensuring the value of research is understood, some stakeholders may come to a researcher with an explicit research request (e.g. &amp;quot;I want to do usability testing on this feature&amp;quot;). This experience puts researchers into a &amp;#39;service model&amp;#39; and prevents researchers from providing real strategic value and looking for opportunities that may be blind spots from stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing service model situations from happening requires researchers to build strong proactive relationships with their stakeholders, so researchers are on the pulse of potential research opportunities and teach them how to come with questions, not solutions, to researcher conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Institutional knowledge inhibits new research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many stakeholders may have domain or institutional knowledge about the area that they are working in, they may make assumptions about customers or products, leading them to drive product decisions on their own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although stakeholders might have daily interactions with customers, they are not customers. Their underlying biases and assumptions based on their experience may not always align with actual customer pain points and needs. Researchers must figure out ways to tactfully push back on these decisions to ensure that research can provide guidance, or analysis, to ensure customer needs are clearly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Insight of one&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If stakeholders are customer-facing, or are part of customer conversations, they are likely to receive feedback on the stakeholders&amp;#39; product or experience. Customers may also &amp;#39;solutionize&amp;#39; (i.e. provide suggestions on fixing the product) during these conversations. If a customer is high value, stakeholders are more likely to reactively decide to change or re-prioritize work based on the customer&amp;#39;s insight or product suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robust stakeholder perspective may be challenging for researchers when they are looking to propose work that may be on a similar topic, as a stakeholder may be adamant that the insight they captured as part of the customer conversation covers the need to conduct additional research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. More time in operations means less time to research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of effort for research operations activities &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/what-is-researchops/&quot;&gt;generally spikes right before, and right after research execution&lt;/a&gt;. When research teams are small or scrappy, they are less likely to invest in having a dedicated research operations resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of all organization and operational activities are then put on the researcher, leaving them less time to focus on ensuring high-quality research throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a dedicated research operations resource also enables them to focus on other ways to improve operations in planning, to run, and synthesizing research that can provide longer-term efficiency gains for researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Recruiting participants is high effort&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large part of a research operations&amp;#39; role is managing the participant recruitment process. If a research panel with customers who have proactively opted to participate in research is not available (either internally or through a vendor), alternative sources have to be used to identify potential participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email open rates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-is-a-good-or-average-email-response-rate-for-email-marketing/https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-is-a-good-or-average-email-response-rate-for-email-marketing/&quot;&gt;generally average 15-25%&lt;/a&gt;, so if there is a niche participant type, it&amp;#39;s even more challenging to recruit enough of the relevant participants to match the required sample size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may also be situations where participant types are not digitally active (e.g. truck drivers), which means potential participants need to be called and manually scheduled individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, managing participants can take more effort: in most cases, confirmation calls are conducted with participants the day before a research session to minimize the potential of no-shows, and allows participants to reschedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. Managing vendors through onboarding processes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors support research in two key ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recruitment &amp;amp; Logistics:&lt;/b&gt; Managing participants, including recruiting, scheduling, and incentive management. Vendors help when there is difficulty finding participant requirements, non-customers / users of a product or if the study is blinded. They may also rent out research labs for researchers to facilitate sessions if internal facilities are not available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research execution:&lt;/b&gt; Running full research projects, including planning, recruiting, execution, and synthesis. These are useful when there is a scoped project with little to no ambiguity (e.g. competitive review, usability testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, vendors need to go through procurement to agree on the work, cost, and expected outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are usually questionnaires related to security, privacy, and operational structures for larger or enterprise organizations that one or more internal teams may manage. In these cases, the researcher / research ops must become the middleman, working across both the internal teams and vendor to prevent timeline slippage of projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procurement can become more complicated if organizations have stringent privacy or data protection processes, as there are strict requirements on what data sharing with external parties (e.g., personally identifiable information or PII off-limits).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is data that the researcher needs to recruit with and they are denied access because of company policy, it can lead to the researcher and vendor having to determine workarounds that may risk the quality of participants or research output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to connect Jira, Confluence, and Trello to Dovetail ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-connect-jira-confluence-and-trello-to-dovetail</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-connect-jira-confluence-and-trello-to-dovetail</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Unlock the power of your findings in the three tools your teams are in every day.

Below is an internal blog that I shared with our team that emphasizes a few changes in how we will operate from now on, in order to give us the best chance at achieving our mission of improving the quality of every thing. The blog has been edited slightly for a public audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote an internal blog called ‘An enduring, purpose-driven and values-based organization’ where we launched our new purpose—to improve the quality of every thing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ultimately, we believe that the outcome of effective customer research is higher quality products and services which often meaningfully improve people’s day-to-day lives. Brad and I look to other companies that focus on making quality and enduring things like Pixar, Apple, Spotify, Steinway, and Rockstar Games, and the impact this focus has on the world in terms of driving innovation, creating lasting experiences, and improving lives. Quality things create a more enjoyable, less frustrating world. Quality things last and are enduring.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Improve the quality of every thing’ is a moonshot. Moonshots move the world forward. They are challenging. They require smart, passionate teams to succeed. “We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies have ambitious missions that aren’t taken seriously. If we choose to take our mission seriously and build software that enables &lt;i&gt;all kinds&lt;/i&gt; of teams to improve &lt;i&gt;all kinds&lt;/i&gt; of things, we will be stretched to heights that few teams have achieved; challenged as individuals more than our friends; and have a lasting impact on ourselves, our peers, our customers, and our end-users, professionally, financially, and personally. By 2030, I would love to say that 1 in 10 companies globally are using Dovetail to power product perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have great customers today, we’re only scratching the surface of our potential. Our greatest work is still ahead of us. For example, when we started Dovetail in 2017, a collaborative editor was an exciting, new technology. Now AI could make the very idea of using an editor completely redundant. Brad and I both got into tech to be on the forefront of technological advancement. We’re not being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, we have created a good company. We’ve led the charge in defining a new category of software—innovating, by definition, as the first mover—and have all the scars to show for it from many poor decisions. We’ve made great progress to date, winning incredible customers. From two people, we have built an exceptional team of 100 smart, highly capable problem solvers who care deeply about our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a good company—but not a great one. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we will co-create one of the best teams in the world. We will excel at all and any technical challenge; move at extreme speed while maintaining an extreme quality bar; be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility&quot;&gt;antifragile&lt;/a&gt;, made stronger by threat or change; execute across all aspects of our business from marketing to reliability to financial operations better than all else; and retain laser focus on doing the things—and only those things—that enable us to achieve our goals and fulfill our purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working at Dovetail will be a rewarding and exciting journey—a place where you are stretched to do the best work of your career. We’ve assembled an incredible group of talented, skilled, and intelligent problem solvers. Let’s make a good company, great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been extremely fortunate to grow up in a great economy. We’ve attracted world-class investors and raised capital in a world flush with cash. But now we find ourselves among ever-growing challenges. We are six years into our journey, facing extreme economic uncertainty in rising interest rates, drastically lower startup valuations, a tougher fundraising environment, and consistent stories of layoffs and shutdowns. We have more competition: startups nipping at our heels; the continued advancement of successful horizontal products; and new, existential technology threats like AI, which have the potential to completely upend our business. We also face many tactical issues across which threaten to distract us and slow us down every single day, including technical debt, slow builds, long meetings, process overhead, missing data, missing peer feedback, and a struggling self-service business, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has never been a more important moment for Dovetail—not only to reflect on how we’re running our business today, but to choose how we want to run our business tomorrow. I am fired up to face these challenges head on, as a team, and excited to share a few things we’re doing this year to give us the best chance of achieving our purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Putting customers first&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tell the world that putting customers front and center leads to more innovation and better products and services. Well, shit. We need to practice what we preach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll be best-in-class users of Dovetail, with a single team taking ownership over our workspace to ensure we use Dovetail properly ourselves. Key product roles and leadership will spend significant time with customers and our customer-facing teams every month, researching and co-designing. We’ll center customer stories in internal comms at all-hands, on our website, in founder updates, and on the walls of our office. We’ll increase visibility of data on wallboards in meeting rooms; and be laser-focused on feature usage, user behavior, and funnel metrics. Obsessing over customers will be a key part of most people’s roles from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Choosing to do hard things&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are making the choice to take our purpose seriously. We recognize how hard and long this journey will be. We understand that this ambition is not for everyone. Our Series A valuation reflects our status as a Moonshot startup, and our traction and growth puts us in the category of incredible companies. We will stay in this category. It will be hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is where the best people do the best work—a place where ambitious, smart, motivated, and highly skilled builders from a diverse range of backgrounds create an innovative future, together. To encourage bolder, more innovative ideas, Make It will now be a full week every six months. We’ll introduce a new performance-based bonus program to celebrate and reward excellence; raise expectations (and provide better support) for all people managers; provide role clarity through clear accountabilities; create a culture of continuous feedback through a mix of structured performance reviews, 360 reviews, and ad-hoc feedback; and continue providing context through events like kick-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Speeding up to stay relevant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What separates mediocre companies from those that define the leading edge is the ability to iterate rapidly, evolve ways of working, and bring meaningful things to customers faster and better. Paul Graham, the co-founder of Y Combinator, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1250061898671947777&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the “Mere rate of shipping new features is a surprisingly accurate predictor of startup success. In this domain, at least, slowness is way more likely to be due to inability than prudence. The startups that do things slowly don’t do them any better. Just slower.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must keep the urgency up. Speed and pragmatic risk-taking is written in our value “Do the thing”. We do not do this by working day and night and burning out. Instead, we’ll rework our operating rhythm. Expect faster decision-making and more urgency to ship to customers; encouragement to take initiative to change processes; more clarity on priorities with clear focus areas and data-driven goals; and efficient planning cycles to drive context and alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Disciplined financial management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must operate with greater discipline to ensure we can fund our mission indefinitely, even if it means cutting back on things we’ve grown accustomed to. This means intentional shifts in how we allocate our finite resources to serve the long-term success of our business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have scaled back hiring, with a clear stack-rank of necessary roles. All hiring will be done at the company-level for the time being to ensure our functional leaders work together to manage tradeoffs. We will forego an all-company annual retreat in favor of smaller and more focused team off-sites; shift budget from perks and benefits to performance-based salary increases, skill training, and learning and development budget; cut the number of tools and software spend across the company; require all travel to have clear goals and itineraries to maximize the value of international trips; and reduce real estate expenses by taking on reduced scope fit-outs, sub-leasing unnecessary space, and recycling everything that’s not screwed to the floor when we move to our new premise on Oxford Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these changes will feel uncomfortable. However, operating in a financially disciplined and sustainable way is the right thing to do to ensure that we stay in control of our future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Playing as a team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we embark on this journey together, we’ll continue to celebrate what has made Dovetail special and successful to date. But because it doesn’t have to be binary, we’ll also embrace change and risk. We’ll make mistakes—I’ll make some of the biggest ones. But we’ll learn together. We’ll share in our wins, there for each other in our losses, and each hurdle we overcome will be all the more special because we did it as a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re all stakeholders—not just financially, but in the pride we take in building something that’s bigger than any one of us, and more impactful together than the sum of our parts. We’d happily sign our names to our work, and it’s through the impact we make that we derive a tremendous sense of fulfillment personally and professionally. It’s not going to be easy—but the things that are impactful and worthwhile never are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great teams are defined by how they face their toughest challenges. We have the chance to create a long-lasting, antifragile culture—an enduring, purpose-driven and values-based organization—that if successful, will have a positive and real impact on us, our customers, and the world. If we don’t strive for something, what is the point of anything?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 ways to make user research part of your team’s daily life]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/five-ways-to-make-user-research-part-of-your-teams-daily-life</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/five-ways-to-make-user-research-part-of-your-teams-daily-life</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The success of a product or service heavily relies on the degree to which the people creating it &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/solution/user-research-platform/&quot;&gt;understand their users&lt;/a&gt;. This task usually falls to designers and researchers, who have the difficult challenge of getting into the heads of users and deeply understanding their needs, behaviors, pain points, and emotions. While user research can be time-consuming, when done right, it will make or break your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large percentages of users will halt business with a company after just one negative experience. Conducting proper user research will provide valuable insights that help you retain users and generate leads. Without it, you may not be able to pinpoint the needs of your users or understand the context of their use. In a nutshell, user research allows companies to marry their product and business strategy with the needs of their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product managers, developers, and the rest of the product team are key players when it comes to user research. They know the product better than anyone else, so involving them in your user research process bridges the (sometimes wide) gap between your team, your stakeholders, and the end-users. It helps them fully understand what it’s like to be on the other side of the product. Here are a few easy ways to get them involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Set up an email newsletter to share recent insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights are most effective when shared directly with your team, and what better way than a summary sent directly to their inbox. Key summaries of recent research findings from usability testing, customer interviews, or survey results will help your team operate more efficiently and with a clearer understanding of your user’s needs. While this research can be divided up between individual departments, a company-wide email newsletter creates a centralized dialogue that allows your user’s voice to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Cover top support themes during retro&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprint retrospective is a place for your team to come together and reflect on the past sprint or milestone. While it’s great for reviewing internal processes and wins / losses, why not make it more customer-centric by sharing a few themes from customer support?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you don’t have easy access to the support inbox, try presenting a summary of any testing or interviews that were completed during the sprint. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/insights/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&amp;#39;s insights&lt;/a&gt; becomes a powerful way to summarize and share insights in a bite-size form without unnecessary detail from your raw notes or analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Get colleagues to participate in usability testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usability testing is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users. When your team members and stakeholders participate in usability testing, they are exposed to how well the product fares with real users in terms of ease-of-use, intuitiveness, memorability, navigation, delight, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suggest teams capture notes collaboratively in real-time on platforms. Dovetail is great for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/analysis/&quot;&gt;aggregating and analyzing&lt;/a&gt; the findings across sessions before finally creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/insights/&quot;&gt;short, sharp insights as a summary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Take teammates with you on customer visits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly meeting and observing people using your product will have a huge impact on building user empathy and deepening your teammate’s understanding of user needs. This is especially true for those who aren’t in regular customer-facing roles like developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach out to a few local customers and ask if you can visit their office. Bring one or two teammates along as a photographer and note-taker. Users are typically happy to share their voice, and in giving them the opportunity, you also provide an avenue in which the user feels valued, thus strengthening their bond with your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Make analysis collaborative and get everyone tagging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;User research is a team sport! Collaborative research analysis boosts the effectiveness of your research and improves your internal research practice. Working as a team means that all interests are covered. All roles and maintain a stake in both the collection and analysis, the result of which will benefit all parties. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/analysis/&quot;&gt;Collaborative tagging&lt;/a&gt; in Dovetail provides a fun and intuitive way for everyone to get involved in research analysis and helps you break down longer documents like transcripts or notes in less time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail for documents: unlock the power of desk research with document tagging and highlighting]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-for-documents</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-for-documents</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There’s an untapped gold mine of cost-effective, quick, and informative desk research just waiting to be analyzed. Before, you couldn’t do this without inefficiently and manually reformatting your documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with Dovetail for documents, all the features you know and love in Dovetail are applicable to anything in a PDF format and more. It’s a first-of-its-kind feature that allows you to bring your valuable desk research into the mix and analyze everything in one place. Strengthen your research with more types of data to create powerful, multi-layered insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start analyzing documents efficiently&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that manually copying, pasting, and formatting documents to analyze is a painful process.

Beyond PDF (.pdf), we also support Microsoft Word documents (.docx), Powerpoint (.pptx), Keynote presentations (.key), and Apple Pages (.pages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of what you can bring in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerpoint / Canva / Keynote presentations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market and competitor reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic papers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venture capital pitch decks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal contracts or documents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;News articles, internet searches, and white papers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Search files seamlessly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t get lost across all this new data you’ve brought in. We’ve improved the search experience to make it easier to surface the information you’re looking for and pinpoint exactly what you need. Now you can filter your search by data type and find keywords deep within files—we’ll even take you to the page of the document that the text or highlight appears on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;P&lt;b&gt;owerful insights are like onions, they have layers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that there’s no one way of doing research, that’s why Dovetail is a mixed-method platform that can flex to your way of working. With all these different sources of information, you can form powerful multi-layered insights that paint a full picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desk research is utilized to understand and narrow down the problem space in research projects. Now you can tie this context into your insights and show your end-to-end process, have all your research and supporting evidence together, and be able to trace it back to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyze PDF documents and more in Dovetail.

For the foreseeable future, this new technology will increasingly be part of the way organizations build products and serve their customers. And Dovetail is no exception—we’re working hard to be at the forefront of this exciting new step in product evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of our vision for AI is a new workflow that speeds up manual tasks and gives you tools to work with data and insights more efficiently. The foundation of customer understanding is a deep connection fostered on empathy for the people you build for. With this in mind, AI will support rather than replace—complementing and augmenting the way you work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Speed, accuracy, and discovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, we will use AI to speed up analysis and reduce bias. Large language models are unparalleled in their ability to hold and interpret data. We will harness this potential to give you a broader and more unbiased perspective of your customers than ever before possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, we’re testing an AI-powered feature that enables you to automatically cluster highlights into themes on a canvas view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, you’ll also be able to summarize data from various sources. For example, simplify &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/templates/projects/4Eie6XYk1BbPRNDzzbfGqe&quot;&gt;a lengthy support conversation&lt;/a&gt; or turn an hour-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/templates/projects/6YvBh4aNkIqV0V3VsEzs4w&quot;&gt;customer interview transcript&lt;/a&gt; into a few bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we’ll even surface relevant tags for faster analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our vision extends beyond simply speeding up workflows. In the future, AI will automatically create draft insights, find related insights, provide increased accuracy for automatic classification, and allow you to quickly search your insights hub and answer questions about your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protecting your privacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand research data contains a lot of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and participants trust you to keep it secure. With fears around privacy, we’re seeing organizations like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-20/using-chatgpt-at-work-nearly-half-of-firms-are-drafting-policies-on-its-use&quot;&gt;limit or ban the use of ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re committed to protecting your data privacy. We limit the number of sub-processors we use, and our AI features are powered by tailored AI infrastructure on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS), meaning your data will always belong to you. Your data won’t be used to train models for other Dovetail customers or AI tools like ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make your data compliance more manageable, eventually we will use AI to automatically redact sensitive information, such as faces and names, before you share insights with stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Working hand-in-hand with AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AI will play an increasingly important role in generating and sharing customer insights, there are limitations to what it can do. Every company is different, and every customer has different needs. Dovetail must be flexible, allowing you to work hand in hand with AI. With our features, AI will support you with suggestions you’ll be able to review, redo, and make changes according to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re working hard testing and tweaking our AI features in Beta, including cluster in canvas, sentiment analysis on notes, and soon summarization in notes and insights. Try them out and share your feedback to help us improve, and stay tuned for more soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about our exciting vision for AI-powered products, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-ai-is-changing-research/&quot;&gt;this Outlier video&lt;/a&gt; for a deep dive into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Four templates to simplify product discovery]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/four-templates-to-simplify-product-discovery</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/four-templates-to-simplify-product-discovery</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Product discovery is an essential step in creating successful products.

We’ve created a list of five community templates that will help you turn that scattered feedback into insights that your team can use. Install a template, import your data, and start finding themes. Let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/projects/6LLitOOZioWYHbjnykqasV&quot;&gt;Streamline product feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/projects/6LLitOOZioWYHbjnykqasV&quot;&gt;product feedback template&lt;/a&gt; is perfect for gathering all sorts of feedback.

Standardizing your approach to creating customer insights doesn’t have to be dull or repetitive. Giving your team shared frameworks means that you can create a common language. Your team will save time because they don’t have to figure it out from scratch every time. Plus, you can drive focus by easily connecting your team’s work to organizational goals and themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s stopping you? Read on to learn three ways you can start standardizing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Connect cross-project themes with workspace tags&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding connections across projects can be hard. Workspace tags make it easy. They enable you to create global tags that span across many projects and standardize tags across your team. This is great for things like shared feature requests, jobs to be done, competitors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admins and users can convert tag boards within a project—just click the ••• next to the tag board in your project sidebar, then &lt;b&gt;Convert to workspace tag board&lt;/b&gt;. Explore &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/tags&quot;&gt;tag boards in the Dovetail community&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Slice data consistently with workspace fields&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;See your data from different angles. Fields allow you to add structured data to notes and insights so you can easily filter and search down the track. Workspace fields allow you to standardize fields across your workspace to make finding, organizing, and reusing data easy. Use workspace fields for things like persona, role, and date. Insights fields are great for surfacing insights by team or insight type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admins can create, organize, and manage your workspace fields in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/settings/fields&quot;&gt;workspace settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Skip the setup with project templates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your team on the same page. Project templates help you standardize and communicate your team’s approach by creating a starting set of data, tags, and fields that your team can get started with. It’s a great way to speed up the process of setting up new projects and create alignment, especially if you’re repeating projects like usability testing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admins can create and update templates in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/settings/templates&quot;&gt;workspace settings&lt;/a&gt;. See how other teams set up and manage their &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/projects&quot;&gt;projects in the Dovetail community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pro tip: try them all together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use all of these tools together to standardize your workspace. Create a project template that includes a workspace tag board to ensure that teams are reusing standardized tags. Link workspace fields to the project template to ensure that teams are standardizing the note and insight fields, which can aid in searching for and discovering data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re working this way, it’s easy to surface tailored content using feeds. For example, if you use a workspace and everyone standardizes their insights, you can set up feeds based on the workspace fields that will notify each team when a new insight relevant to their team is created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These features are only available on Team, Business, and Enterprise plans.

Add them to any project and start tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grow with the community&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continue to learn with the support of your community.

While it’s still early days, here are some of the things we’ve learned from our community so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, look how easy it is to connect themes across NPS, in-product feedback, and more with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/projects/6LLitOOZioWYHbjnykqasV&quot;&gt;product feedback template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or how using canvas to map different stages of activation is a breeze with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/projects/2KMPgpjnZXP1pQRXU8Kcus&quot;&gt;Kickstarter’s customer engagement template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also learned how charts can take survey analysis to the next level with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/projects/6d3b6T1AI0cVspcempVgrQ&quot;&gt;NPS response analysis template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/projects/1cdnzqqCyTlnltZMi9iYuY&quot;&gt;Maze’s unmoderated usability testing template&lt;/a&gt; makes using fields to slice up data by browser, language, and more look easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learned how to differentiate the behavioral patterns of users and non-users with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/tags/3Y0F3LapibvnJBMSsnd6f&quot;&gt;creating personas tag board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, we saw how to group tags to identify areas of improvement, pains, and themes with&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/templates/tags/5Alf2WxteD6ecIBO3WWct6&quot;&gt; Sprig&amp;#39;s CSAT tag board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Set your methods free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community isn’t just a place to explore and try templates.

It aims to uncover insights behind customer decisions, perceptions, and requirements to drive innovation for improved experiences and new offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a VoC program helps utilize all the valuable feedback go-to-market teams receive from customers and drives empathy across an organization. Teams to get involved (but are not excluded to): Product, Marketing, Customer Success, Support, and Sales. Any team that interacts with the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to get started&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a kick-off session to discuss and decide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which customer feedback channels are important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which teams will be involved, and at what stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will own what tasks e.g. importing data, tagging, analysis, sharing out reports, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the output from this program will be (usually a report or insight within Dovetail), as well as its cadence, objectives, and key stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What data to include and how&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common types of VoC data include in-app feedback, NPS scores, and support tickets. Others channels of data could be customer interviews, sales calls, social media engagement and comments, and community conversations e.g. via Slack. Use our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/connect-apps-to-dovetail-with-zapier/&quot;&gt;Zapier integration&lt;/a&gt; to connect and automate importing data from apps like Airtable, SurveyMonkey, Hubspot, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail/integrations&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;. You can also easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/import-structured-spreadsheet-data/&quot;&gt;import any structured data directly from a Csv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Start building it out in Dovetail&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a VoC project to store and analyze all of your data. Identify your main listening channels (channels where you hear from the customer) and create a separate note view for each channel to start importing data into. Organizing your data well at this point will streamline the rest of the process significantly. Some tips for this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add fields to your notes to structure the data e.g. participant, role, persona, company, research round, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One field to add is the time period to group by e.g. monthly or quarterly, and this will depend on the cadence you’ve chosen. Each board should align to a period e.g. March 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find an example of a note view below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Turning high-volume feedback into succinct insights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide on a tagging taxonomy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing all the data you’ve imported, decide on a tagging taxonomy or global tag board that you will use (this can be defined in the kick-off). The tags should reflect logical themes such as by customer sentiment, core product features, customer personas or customer problems, etc. Your taxonomy will change and evolve as your company and project grow. Find an example to start from below, or use our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dt-marketing.dovetailapp.com/templates/tags/3ajICN072XP0mBoFLPCV5E&quot;&gt;Voice of the Customer tag board template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyze and synthesize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to highlight and tag up your data. Make sure you’re clear about what teams are responsible for what channel e.g. Marketing is responsible for NPS feedback analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various ways to synthesize your data, and Dovetail is flexible enough to suit many mental models. The most common approach is through grouping highlights with affinity mapping on canvas view to identify common themes e.g. a specific feature request, a common pain point, a persona that appears over and over, etc. Some tips here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use additional views for affinity mapping e.g. for each team or each core part of the product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the bulk tag function to quickly group highlights together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make affinity mapping collaborative in Dovetail. Bring different teams in, like Customer Success, Marketing, Sales, and even your Engineers, to participate in this task to expose more of the company to feedback and develop more customer empathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From these themes that you’ve identified, you can produce individual insights. These can be granular findings or act as more big-picture ideas; both have pros and cons and depend on the process your team has decided on. To create an insight, you can directly go to the insights section of your project, click ‘new insight’ and start pulling in highlights, tags, and other supporting data. Alternatively, you can select relevant highlights from any view and create an insight straight from those. Tips for this process:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use fields for insights e.g. findings, VoC report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an example insight template for consistently formatted findings that are easy to comprehend. Use headings, highlights, and references&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have someone in charge of creating the final VoC report from these individual insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have in mind what your final VoC report or output will look like to guide how you structure your insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Structuring your report for impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group your insights in your report in a way that makes sense to your organization. For example by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product (for multi-product orgs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact (high, medium, low)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer sentiment. Make sure to show some customer love too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your report should be clearly structured, each section with a maximum of 2-3 key insights to keep it concise and impactful. You can also get creative with these reports and add more context with graphs, images, and videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to maximize VoC impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share your report where your teams are&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s working well, a VoC begins to create a culture of customer obsession and can help influence product ideas and business decisions. Start by bringing it to where your team is e.g. sharing in Slack, Notion, Confluence, and more with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;Dovetail’s integrations&lt;/a&gt;. You can also present in team demos or even organize a company-wide watch party for a monthly VoC session. When you define the key stakeholders and objectives at the kick-off, this should determine where and how you share the outputs and measure success. For example, the number of views, watches, and reactions, number of comments and conversations sparked, or the number of insights actioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recycle your research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a rich hub of customer data, you can do anything with it. When you’re kicking off a new project, use your VoC as desk research to start with. When a new starter is onboarding, point them towards your VoC to bring them closer to the customer. Over time, the VoC can also be directional in discovering or guiding new research projects and areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Taking the show on the road: Bringing persona-lity to SXSW]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/sxsw</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/sxsw</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to massive multimedia festivals that encompass the arts, technology, and a good old-fashioned cultural bender, few compare to Austin’s South by Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The festival is a nine-day deluge of music, film, interactive art, and tech. And as a company that values all things creativity and technology, we had to find a way to take part in the festivities. So we cracked out the checkbook and signed up to sponsor the Interactive Opening Party. And boy, did we have a blast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s lineup included huge names like comedians Eric Andre and Chelsea Handler, music acts like Armani White and Balming Tiger, and impressive sponsors (and favorite customers of ours) Volkswagen and Porsche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know, we know—it’s hard to compete with such amazing names. But still, we brought our best selves to the opening night and kicked off the festival in style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give SXSW festivalgoers a little taste of the research and design world, we built a 15-foot mural of playful personas. Because the host city’s motto is “Keep Austin Weird,” we thought it would be fun to celebrate the wonderfully offbeat SXSW denizens by bringing them to life with a twist on our usual Dovetail art style. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because we’re all about empowering people to research in all manner of ways and methods, we brought physical Dovetail tags to life and allowed people to tag themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the heart of good personas is real customer data—so we sourced ours from quick interviews with Dovetailers who had attended and backed up our assumptions with secondary research we found in and around the old SXSW archives. Though we followed this &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; rigorous approach, we wouldn’t advise using these personas for anything other than kicking off a party. (Though if you &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; want to, our brand team set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://expert-armadillo-3ryv.dovetailapp.com/templates/tags/2Mih4CMiunZLDxXry0TGE9&quot;&gt;this tagboard&lt;/a&gt; in the Dovetail Community so you can give it a try).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were lucky enough to attend, give us a yell and let us know what you thought of our mural. And if you didn’t—never fear, we captured some of the highlights for your viewing pleasure right here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fantastic DJ brought the vibes. He did not, however, play Darude &lt;i&gt;Sandstorm&lt;/i&gt;, no matter how many times it was requested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This partygoer showing us how it’s done with some unintentional product placement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tag, you’re it. These folks making good use of the IRL Dovetail tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To everyone we worked with—thank you for helping bring this to life! We can’t wait to do it again even bigger and better next year. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to contribute to the Dovetail community]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/contribute-to-the-community</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/contribute-to-the-community</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://dovetailapp.com/community&quot;&gt;Dovetail community&lt;/a&gt; is your place to connect, learn, and share with like-minded people and level up your practice. By contributing, you’ll join industry leaders helping to push the craft forward as well as elevating your approach, team, and organization. Together, we’re building the future of research—and we want you to be a part of it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can you get involved? It’s simple—follow these four steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose to contribute a project template or a tag board &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find your best project or tag board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hit submit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share it with the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Project or tag board?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, pick what you’d like to contribute. You can either share how you organize a project end-to-end with a project template or show off your tagging taxonomy with a tag board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project templates&lt;/b&gt; include everything that’s in your project. They include Readme, views, tags, layouts, and more—users just need to add data. If you’ve got a project or workspace project that guides you or your team to get insights sooner, this is your opportunity to share it with the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tag boards&lt;/b&gt; are a way to share your tagging taxonomy. You’ll find tags (of course), groups, colors, descriptions, and ordering. Community tag boards can be applied to any existing project. If you’ve got a tag board that helps you and your team find themes, now you can share it further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Pick your &lt;b&gt;project or tag board&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to choose your best project template or tag board. You might already have a tried and tested workspace template or tag board that you want to share. If you want to make some tweaks or are starting from scratch, here are some tips to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tips for choosing the right project template&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great project template is clear and easy to use right away. Here are some things to think about when you’re creating your template:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;b&gt;Readme &lt;/b&gt;to include information like goals, plan, interview questions, and any other tips you have&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;b&gt;fields &lt;/b&gt;that match your use case to make it easy to slice and dice results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try out different &lt;b&gt;views&lt;/b&gt; organize content in a way that suits your approach. You can create as many views as you like using different layouts and filters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep it clear of raw data so it’s more secure for you, and the user doesn’t need to spend time deleting content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: keep your project organized by hiding unnecessary information (like notes, highlights, or charts) in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tips for choosing a tag board template&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great tag board is organized and tailored to a particular use case, goal, or industry. Here are some things to think about when you’re creating your board:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply clear &lt;b&gt;tag names &lt;/b&gt;that are easy to understand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;b&gt;groups &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;colors&lt;/b&gt; to organize tags. It will make them easier to navigate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drag to reorder tags in a way that makes sense to you. Common organizational methods include alphabetical order or frequency of use &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: upload custom Hex codes to match your brand colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Go on, submit!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re almost there—it’s time to submit your project or board. Anyone in your workspace with edit access can do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To submit a project template&lt;/b&gt;, hover on the project name, then click &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;•••&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This will reveal a menu where you can select &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publish to community&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/community-submissions/#:~:text=would%20any%20other.-,Publish%20your%20project%20template,-Coming%20soon!&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To submit a tag board&lt;/b&gt;, hover on the board name, then click &lt;code&gt;•••&lt;/code&gt;.

From interviews, support tickets, and sales calls to NPS, CSAT, usability testing, app reviews, and churn reasons—it feels like we have data coming in from everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While getting your hands on customer data has never been easier, getting the most out of it is hard. With each type of data, there is a different source which means anyone wanting an accurate look at their customer needs has to navigate a chaotic and fragmented data landscape. What’s more, as long as raw data sits in its original collection tool, it remains mostly unanalyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re working hard to bring you the perfect solution that transforms fragmented customer data into a single source of insights your whole organization can use. We’re giving you more control over how you organize projects. With customizable views, layouts, and a flexible sidebar, you can now structure projects to accommodate any type of data and research method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get you started, here are three examples of things you can bring into Dovetail today. If three isn’t enough, stay tuned to the end—we have a surprise coming your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Store past research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t lose your old reports. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-bring-research-reports-into-dovetail/&quot;&gt;Bring past research into Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; for your team to discover again and again.

The path to customer-centricity begins with great customer research—and we’re uniquely positioned to help teams achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We help teams consolidate and understand disparate customer research data through analysis, synthesis, and summarization features. By providing value in these stages of the research journey, we help teams build their research repository organically from the bottom up, enabling them to drive compounding value and continued impact from their investment in research. This is a new category of software that aims to connect data from a variety of fragmented research methods and tools and help teams draw connections between data to form insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our current focus is on researchers and designers working in 100-plus person technology companies who conduct continuous research. These groups comprise a large and fast-growing segment with an acute need for our product, and—unlike their peers in product management, marketing, or customer experience—researchers and designers have fewer alternatives for rapid analysis, synthesis, and summarization of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve spoken to hundreds of researchers and designers over the years, and we know from our research that there are endless opportunities to solve pain across the entire research journey from planning to archival. However, in order to achieve our mission, we’re focusing our efforts on the middle of the journey—analyze, synthesize, summarize, and share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Identify, plan, prepare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that already solve for these phases of the journey, which involve activities like creating a research plan, defining learning goals, creating project timelines, documenting participant criteria, aligning stakeholders, recruiting and managing participants, and scheduling research sessions. Tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/software/confluence/&quot;&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/docs/about/&quot;&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://userinterviews.com/&quot;&gt;User Interviews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://askable.com/&quot;&gt;Askable&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://consentkit.com/&quot;&gt;Consent Kit&lt;/a&gt; have this covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is opportunity for us to integrate with these tools to create a seamless user experience across the journey, this isn’t a priority right now, and so we’re “avoiding” this part of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Execute&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Execution of research is where the actual data is collected. This could be in an interview, a survey, a usability testing session, or a support ticket. This is a mature, crowded, and fragmented market often split by method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tools are primarily focused on productivity for individuals which limits the long-term revenue potential from team-wide engagement. However, it’s critical that our customers can import data from these tools for their journey to continue in Dovetail, so rather than “avoiding” this phase entirely, our strategy is to integrate with the solutions we know people love in order to make it easy to ingest data and proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples of some tools in the “execute” phase that we may integrate with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interviews:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.google.com/meet/&quot;&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usability testing:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://usertesting.com/&quot;&gt;UserTesting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.com/&quot;&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.com/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://optimalworkshop.com/&quot;&gt;Optimal Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surveying:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://typeform.com/&quot;&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sprig.com/&quot;&gt;Sprig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://surveymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;SurveyMonkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qualtrics.com/&quot;&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/forms/about/&quot;&gt;Google Forms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://front.com/&quot;&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zendesk.com/&quot;&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://servicenow.com/&quot;&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/&quot;&gt;Jira Service Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NPS/CSAT:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://delighted.com/&quot;&gt;Delighted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://asknicely.com/&quot;&gt;AskNicely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medallia.com/&quot;&gt;Medallia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sales:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gong.io/&quot;&gt;Gong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://outreach.io/&quot;&gt;Outreach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chorus.ai/&quot;&gt;Chorus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Analyze, synthesize&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have built strong domain knowledge and technical expertise in these phases and have invested in many powerful features to help teams make sense of their unstructured data, from video transcription and highlights, to segmentation with views, and deep search within files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know from our own research that many individuals currently use flexible, horizontal “substitutes” to solve for data analysis and synthesis—tools like Google Docs, Google Sheets, Airtable, Miro. However there are significant challenges with using these tools that are specific to research, and we believe that Dovetail offers significant value beyond what these tools can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Efficient analysis.&lt;/b&gt; Tools like Google Sheets and Miro require significant effort to structure raw data. Dovetail leverages structured data to automatically group content and identify themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traceability of data.&lt;/b&gt; Retaining a link between research outputs and the original data source helps researchers build trust with stakeholders, resulting in greater buy-in. Traceability is also important for reusing research, and preventing misinterpreting data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discoverability of prior research.&lt;/b&gt; The flexibility of horizontal tools means they often aren’t intentionally structured to help teams find research based on specific topics, teams, or product areas. This makes finding and analyzing past research difficult, prevents stakeholders from self serving, and leads to teams doubling up on research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collaborative research process.&lt;/b&gt; Involving stakeholders in the research journey is important for building buy-in, but many horizontal tools are not collaborative. Researchers end up exporting data to other places, meaning inefficient reformatting and resulting in lack of traceability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Managing participant privacy.&lt;/b&gt; Data privacy is an increasing concern for organizations, and researchers are at the forefront. When data is spread across several tools, it’s very difficult for organizations to adhere to privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility in the research process.&lt;/b&gt; Horizontal tools usually restrict researchers to analyzing just one kind of data, often specified by the tool rather than their needs. Analysis and synthesis of mixed methods research (like survey data and customer interviews) isn’t possible, preventing researchers from creating a complete and coherent understanding of their customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, given the horizontal nature of these tools, they’re unlikely to invest in purpose-built solutions for research—this means we can develop significant product differentiation in this area, playing to our strengths as a product-led company. For example we may choose to build video anonymization features where Airtable would never build something that specific for their customer base. Differentiated product features, a strong technical moat, and our existing momentum with our brand and product in this phase makes it difficult for a fast-follower to compete with us. We will continue to invest in these phases of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summarize, share&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research isn’t valuable until the insights that come out of the research are shared. We’ll continue to invest in summarizing (e.g. highlight reels and insights), collaboration features (e.g. comments and notifications), and sharing features (e.g. public links). We’ll also integrate with collaboration tools like Slack and Confluence to meet stakeholders where they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measure, store&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After research is completed, many teams “archive” their data and reports for the future. Often that happens in tools like Google Drive, Dropbox, Sharepoint, or Confluence. We also hear researchers ask for better ways to measure the impact of their research, through features like engagement analytics and integrations with product management tools like Jira, Productboard, and Asana to close the loop. In the immediate term, focusing on the earlier phases of the journey above will allow us to learn more about the customer needs in these phases and will expand our investment here in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking to the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, we’ve focused mainly on solving for the needs of researchers and designers (methods like interviews and usability testing). But we know that customer-facing research is much more than solely interviewing customers over Zoom. For example, product managers will analyze product feedback, customer success managers and support teams might handle complaints, and account executives might capture sales demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help teams consolidate their data and build a compounding research repository, we’re expanding what data we support in Dovetail. We’re investing in solving for other common research methods like surveys, product feedback, NPS, and more. Driving flexibility and expanding the methods and data formats that Dovetail supports will allow us to expand to more roles and teams doing different kinds of research, as an essential research tool across the business.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to bring research reports into Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-bring-research-reports-into-dovetail</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-bring-research-reports-into-dovetail</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for an efficient way to store and manage these reports, look no further. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to gather, upload, organize, and share this existing knowledge so that you can stop repeating research and start getting repeated value from your insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gather your existing research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you can import your existing user research into Dovetail, you need to gather all the relevant documents and data. For many orgs, this knowledge is fragmented across shared drives, company wikis, emails, and hard drives, and centralizing it can be quite a chore. In these circumstances, we recommend a more incremental approach, prioritizing the migration of key research findings first. To do this, we recommend that you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sort user research reports by date, with the most recent reports at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritize reports that are most important to ongoing projects, such as those related to key features or areas of focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include reports that are part of a larger research project, such as those that contain data from multiple sources or that provide an overall summary of research findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, prioritize any reports that are due soon or are tied to an upcoming deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Format your existing research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gathered your user research, you need to make sure it’s in the right format for import. For reports, this means making sure the files are in PDF, CSV, PowerPoint or Excel format. This will ensure that the contents of your report will be fully searchable from within Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Set up your Dovetail workspace&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you can import your user research into Dovetail, you’ll need to configure your workspace. This means creating relevant projects for your reports, plus setting up user accounts and assigning roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating projects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dovetail, projects are flexible and can house both raw data and insights. We recommend storing your reports as &lt;b&gt;Insights.&lt;/b&gt;  To do so, you can create as few or as many projects as you need. For instance, if you have four key customer personas, you may decide to make four projects to house your existing insights about each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assigning permissions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail has a flexible permissions system that allows you to set different levels of access for each user. For example, you can allow a user to only view certain projects, or give a user full administrative access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Import your research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can begin the actual import process. Dovetail makes it easy to upload user research documents and data into your account in bulk, allowing you to quickly and easily search for key words and topics. To import a research report, create a new &lt;b&gt;Insights view,&lt;/b&gt; then drag and drop your files into the view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of your uploaded files will be stored as a separate insight, with the title of the insight mirroring your file name. From here, you can add&lt;b&gt; fields&lt;/b&gt; to group and organize your insights however you would like.  For instance, you could create a field named &lt;i&gt;Research style &lt;/i&gt;to group your insights by &lt;i&gt;Generative&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Evaluative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get repeated value from your research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve imported your research, Dovetail automatically makes their contents entirely searchable from the &lt;b&gt;Search and discover &lt;/b&gt;bar at the top of your workspace. This allows you to quickly and easily find for trends and insights hidden deep within your files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it! Now that you know how to gather, upload, organize, and share your existing knowledge, jump into Dovetail and give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to import structured spreadsheet data into Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-import-structured-spreadsheet-data-into-dovetail</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-import-structured-spreadsheet-data-into-dovetail</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheet data is also helpful in tracking product feedback, survey responses, and quantitative usability testing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to leverage the power of structured spreadsheet data in your Dovetail projects, you’ve come to the right place. In this blog, we’ll discuss the basics of importing structured spreadsheet data into Dovetail, so you can get up and running quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Formatting your spreadsheet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll need to do is ensure that your spreadsheet data is appropriately formatted. This means that the data should be organized into rows and columns in a way that makes sense. For example, suppose your data contains customer information with product feedback. In that case, you’ll want to ensure that each row represents a customer and each column represents a particular piece of information about that customer (e.g., name, job role, written feedback, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to save your spreadsheet data as a CSV with less than 5000 rows. Dovetail does not support XSLX or Numbers files, but it’s straightforward to export most file formats to CSV from tools like Excel or Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Importing your spreadsheet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your data is properly formatted, you can import it into Dovetail. Start by navigating to a Dovetail project. In general, structured data is best viewed in a table—you can create a Note Table by clicking &lt;b&gt;Add a view&lt;/b&gt; under &lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt; in your left sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To import a spreadsheet, select the option to &lt;b&gt;Create from a spreadsheet&lt;/b&gt;. From here, you’ll be able to drag and drop your CSV. You’ll also have the opportunity to specify the format of the data, as well as any additional mapping options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mapping your columns&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two mandatory columns are required for mapping: &lt;b&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Content&lt;/b&gt;—these two columns correspond to the title and qualitative feedback within your note.  When you’ve mapped a column, it will go green. If you’d like to compare and contrast different segments of your data when you analyze, map your chosen segmentation variables as &lt;b&gt;Single-Select&lt;/b&gt; fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyzing user sentiment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze customer feedback, measure customer satisfaction and identify potential areas of improvement. To automatically analyze the sentiment of your &lt;b&gt;Content&lt;/b&gt; column, tick the &lt;b&gt;Analyze sentiment&lt;/b&gt; box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyzing data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you’ve clicked &lt;b&gt;Import,&lt;/b&gt; Dovetail will bring your feedback into the &lt;b&gt;note table&lt;/b&gt; you created earlier. Positive or negative sentiment will show up in the &lt;b&gt;Tags&lt;/b&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, you can flexibly view your data however you like. For example, to browse through product feedback from different customer segments, create a &lt;b&gt;Note board&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Group by&lt;/b&gt; your segment of choice. Analysis and synthesis can proceed as usual—check out the rest of our guides for some best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to it! With just a few simple steps, you’ll be able to import structured spreadsheet data into Dovetail easily. Now that you know the basics of importing structured spreadsheet data into Dovetail, you’ll be able to take advantage and take your high-volume research to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to integrate Dovetail with Slack]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-integrate-dovetail-with-slack</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-integrate-dovetail-with-slack</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sharing research is often a challenge—especially when you’re working with multiple teams and stakeholders.

This can be done by visiting the Slack App Directory and searching for “Dovetail.” Once you’ve found it, click &lt;b&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/b&gt; and follow the instructions to add it to your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can install our Slack integration direct from Dovetail. Under &lt;b&gt;Settings,&lt;/b&gt; click &lt;b&gt;Integrations, &lt;/b&gt;then the &lt;b&gt;Connect &lt;/b&gt;button beneath Slack.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Dovetail is added to your workspace, you can start sharing, viewing, and searching for research with your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Receiving research notifications and comments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail will notify you of comments or updates to any piece of research that you have followed or commented on. To follow a Story, click the &lt;b&gt;Follow&lt;/b&gt; button in the top right hand corner of your page. To reply to a comment, click &lt;b&gt;Reply&lt;/b&gt; and enter your comment in the pop up-up window, which will be sent directly to Dovetail once you click Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Searching for research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To search your insights hub for research, open any Slack channel and write &lt;i&gt;/dovetail search,&lt;/i&gt; followed by any keywords you’d like to find. For example, if you wanted to search for competitor analysis, you could write &lt;i&gt;/dovetail search competitor analysis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you perform a search from one of your Slack channels, you have the option to post Dovetail content directly to that channel. To do so, click the &lt;b&gt;Post to&lt;/b&gt; button under the piece of content you’d like to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Dovetail Slack integration installed, any shared research will unfurl with rich previews. If you’d like to unlock this functionality for everyone on your team, encourage them to install the Slack integration!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to it! With Dovetail’s Slack integration, you can easily share research with your team without having to leave the Slack workspace.

That’s why we’ve released three new features to speed up your tagging without sacrificing attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recent tags &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed up analysis when you’re tagging large volumes of customer feedback and applying the same tags over and over. Now, the three most recent tags used by you and your team live at the top of the tag menu for easy access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Snap to highlight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placing your mouse exactly where you want a highlight to start and end can be tricky—particularly when you’re moving fast. Now you can select anywhere within the word, and we’ll snap the highlight to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pop-out tag menu&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flexible new tag menu lets you position and reposition it as you go. You’ll be able to access your tags faster and keep your tag menu in the clear from covering important parts of your notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;That’s not all!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips from Dovetail’s very own researcher, Anna Nguyen, to make your tagging even smoother:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re tagging with a team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-fast-reliable-collaborative-analysis/&quot;&gt;sit together&lt;/a&gt; so you can build your taxonomy collaboratively. Add in a tag description and shout out when you’ve created a new tag because sometimes tags can mean different things to different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can, it helps to work with two screens when tagging. Use one to apply tags and the other for your tag boards, so you’re not jumping between tabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re tagging high-volume, repetitive feedback, don’t forget about the ability to search for keywords and apply tags in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now with all of the time you just saved, why don’t you check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;Slack community&lt;/a&gt;?

We can create all of the graphs, tables, and decks we like; but nothing builds empathy quite like hearing it straight from a customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video highlight reels give you an opportunity to bottle these experiences and bring them into the room with you. Reels can live in insights, they can be dropped into decks, or they can be shared as a short-form thought starters in Slack. In this guide, we’ll take you through all the steps required to create your first video highlight reel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to create a video highlight reel: top-down, and bottom-up. Both require highlighting and tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
Building top-down highlight reels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top-down highlight reels are perfect when you’ve decided to make a reel as an afterthought, perhaps at the end of of a project.  This approach starts with choosing your most critical tags, then uses filtering to progressively narrow down on your important highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Choosing critical tags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from one of your tag boards, click into a tag of interest. If you’re not sure where to start, it can be helpful to &lt;b&gt;Sort&lt;/b&gt; your tags by &lt;b&gt;Count&lt;/b&gt; to identify your tags with the greatest of number of highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve chosen a tag, you’ll be taken to its page. At the top of the page, you’ll see your video highlight reel, and at the bottom, all of the reels’ constituent highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
Refining your reel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, adopt a mindset of ruthless minimalism. When it comes to choosing highlights to include, less is more. To remove redundant or non-critical highlights, use the &lt;b&gt;Filter&lt;/b&gt; button. You can chain together as many filters as you need to drill down to your favourites. Potential options include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtering by word&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtering by participant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtering by demographic, psychographic, or firmographic field&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rearrange the order of your reel’s highlights, click the &lt;b&gt;Sort&lt;/b&gt; button. You can order your highlights by &lt;b&gt;Participant, Date Created&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Alphabetically.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sharing your reel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re happy with your highlight, you have two options: share it directly or export it as a .MOV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To share directly, click the &lt;b&gt;Share&lt;/b&gt; button in the top right. From there, you can copy a link to your reel, or share it directly with any teammate who has a Dovetail account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To export your reel, click the &lt;b&gt;Download&lt;/b&gt; button in the bottom right hand corner of your reel. Once you’ve downloaded your reel, it’s easy to drag and drop the file into a Keynote, PowerPoint, or Canva presentation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building bottom-up highlight reels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom-up highlights are the more intentional approach to reel creation. This is ideal for when you’re starting off a project, and want to explicitly build up content for your reel as you go through your analysis. This approach is much more straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Creating tags specifically for reels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From your tag board, create a new tag group, and name it &lt;b&gt;Reels.&lt;/b&gt; This group will be a container for the key video highlights you’d like to share with stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you intend to create several reels, create several tags within your new tag group: for instance, &lt;b&gt;Reel A, Reel B,&lt;/b&gt; etc. You can give these more descriptive names later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tagging highlights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you go through your analysis, keep your Reel board in mind. If you come across something important enough to include, use one of your new Reel tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Refining and sharing your reels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, all of the same principles apply as in the top-down case. Use &lt;b&gt;Filter&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Sort&lt;/b&gt; to iterate on the content and order of your reel, and the &lt;b&gt;Share&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Download&lt;/b&gt; buttons to share the finished product in the way that best works for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating and sharing reels can be one of the most powerful tools at your disposal for effectively communicating insights gaining research buy-in. Jump into Dovetail and create your first reel today.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail in 2023: visualizing our versatile and efficient product]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-2023</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-2023</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Placing customers at the heart of any organization is a huge challenge. While teams collect mountains of customer feedback (e.g. interviews, NPS surveys, sales calls, in-product feedback, app store reviews, usability testing), most are overwhelmed by analyzing it all efficiently. When insights emerge through arduous analysis, convincing stakeholders to take action remains a challenge. Moreover, stored insights are fragmented across cloud tools in disparate formats like structured survey responses, videos, or PDF presentations, making continuous learning difficult at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to improve the quality of every thing. We believe that teams who listen to their users create higher quality things. To help teams address these challenges, we’re building a versatile product that enables efficient analysis of data from any source, in any format, empowering our customers to create more engaging insights that drive action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2022&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year we released new features to help teams &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/introducing-files-in-dovetail/&quot;&gt;store, reference, and share files in Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, including full-document search within files like presentations, white-papers, and research reports. We shipped &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/introducing-views-affinity-mapping/&quot;&gt;five new ways to slice and dice data&lt;/a&gt; including a collaborative canvas for visual synthesis. We enhanced projects to&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/speed-up-analysis/&quot;&gt; support high volume data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/power-up-your-projects/&quot;&gt;more file types and customization&lt;/a&gt;, launched &lt;a href=&quot;/help/viewing-workspace-analytics/&quot;&gt;workspace analytics&lt;/a&gt; to measure stakeholder engagement, became &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/health-is-wealth-were-hipaa-ready/&quot;&gt;HIPAA compliant for healthcare customers&lt;/a&gt;, released &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/privacy-without-pain-data-retention-is-here/&quot;&gt;custom video data retention&lt;/a&gt; to drive compliance and participant privacy, and increased our transcription languages to 31 with the addition of Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin. In all, we delivered thousands of improvements to speed up Dovetail, fix issues, and make the platform more usable (see more of them at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/changes&quot;&gt;dovetailapp.com/changes&lt;/a&gt;). We also launched &lt;a href=&quot;/outlier/introducing-outlier/&quot;&gt;a digital magazine for product people&lt;/a&gt;; opened our San Francisco office, tripled our team to over 100 Dovetailers, and placed in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-secrets-out-were-officially-in-the-top-ten-of-australias-best-workplaces/&quot;&gt;the top 10 best places to work in Australia&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, our customers uploaded over 22 years of video and audio, created 3 million notes, 11 million highlights, and over 600,000 research insights in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2023&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Dovetail helps thousands of teams develop better products for people to use, better experiences for users to engage with, and better services for the public to rely on—see some of our customers and read their stories at &lt;a href=&quot;/customers/&quot;&gt;dovetailapp.com/customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, we’ll continue to invest in making Dovetail &lt;b&gt;versatile&lt;/b&gt; so you can house all research and feedback, &lt;b&gt;efficient&lt;/b&gt; to reduce the time to insight, &lt;b&gt;integrated&lt;/b&gt; with the tools you love, &lt;b&gt;scalable&lt;/b&gt; for large teams, and &lt;b&gt;connected&lt;/b&gt; to a community of like-minded professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supporting all research and feedback&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail will be the source of truth for all customer insights, no matter the origin, research method, or format the data comes in. Imagine being able to tag PDFs, screenshots, photos, screen recordings, or multiple choice responses in structured surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New features that enable analysis of all kinds of data will unlock efficient research for use cases beyond interviews and usability testing, into competitor analysis, market research, synthesis of support themes or product feedback, and even customer call analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re conducting interviews, building your insights hub, or collating competitor screenshots, Dovetail projects are flexible to support any workflow. Set up your project in a way that’s fit for purpose with a customizable sidebar, features you can toggle on and off, and built-in support for all kinds of data and file formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to share insights, Dovetail makes it easy to create engaging, delightful, and consumable outputs. New features in 2023 include editable highlight reels, automatic summarization, public links to specific highlights, improved invite flows and user onboarding, and integrations with collaboration tools like Notion and Jira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reducing time to insight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making sense of unstructured data is arduous and time consuming. In 2023, we’re focused on driving efficiency with new AI features to cut the time it takes to go from source data to a sharable, summarized insight. Here’s a few examples of what you’ll be able to do with AI assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Write research questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail provides a useful starting point—imagine using a product plan template to document your learning goals, and Dovetail’s AI assistance automatically writes interview questions for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summarize data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gathered your original data (e.g. by connecting Zendesk for support tickets, Zoom for video recordings, or Typeform for survey responses), automatic summarization makes it trivial to cut out noise and focus on the important takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Condense videos&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s AI will shorten videos to skip the fluff and only include the important parts of the conversation. Easily navigate videos with automatic categorization into chapters, identifying when there’s a screen being shared, and sentiment analysis on video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Suggest tags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed up your analysis of video, documents, images, or plain text with suggested tags based on your highlight. Simply select what’s important and Dovetail’s AI assistance recommends relevant existing tags from your tag boards, or suggests a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Find themes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthesizing large amounts of unstructured data is a manual process. Even knowing where to start is overwhelming. In 2023, Dovetail’s AI assistance automatically clusters your highlights into themes, and can even create ready-to-share insights for you, complete with a title, description, and AI generated cover image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Redact sensitive information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you’re ready to share insights and highlights, choose to protect the privacy of your participants and redact PII while retaining the actual content—Dovetail’s AI can automatically detect and redact faces, names, and other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Integrate the tools you love&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-party integrations with point solutions like Maze mean there’s no need to reformat data to prepare it for analysis in Dovetail. Connect Dovetail to dozens of point solutions like usability testing, video calling, surveying, and support desk software, and surface insights where your team works with collaboration, roadmapping, and task tracking integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using something we don’t support? We’ve got you covered. Just use Dovetail’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail&quot;&gt;powerful Zapier app&lt;/a&gt;, upload a CSV, or drop a folder of files into a project to upload them, convert them, and make them searchable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A scalable, standardized insights hub&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience the true benefit of a compounding, org-wide customer insights hub with a range of improvements to scale and standardize research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New features like folders, saved searches, and three levels of permissions (at the workspace, folder, and project level) help you scale Dovetail to thousands of projects and users across your organization. Workspace tags, fields, saved searches, and custom project and insight templates drive standardization of process, taxonomy, and organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved workspace tags (formerly extensions) allow you to synthesize themes across projects, while automatically generated global insights help teams build a holistic understanding of the customer from data across the entire workspace—without any manual work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s customizable branding, home, subdomain, and saved searches, allows you to curate the stakeholder experience, while deep search within video, documents, and text—along with AI assistance—allow stakeholders to self-service insights without bothering anyone. Simply write what you’re looking for and Dovetail returns results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is underpinned by world-class security and administration features like configurable user authentication, single sign-on, custom data retention policies, activity audit log, editor version history. Along with SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA readiness. In 2023, you can even choose whether your Dovetail data is stored in the US, Europe, or Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Dovetail community&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know there’s no one way to conduct research or make sense of customer feedback—everyone does it a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dovetail community contains thousands of templates created by people like you. Tag boards act as starter packs for a tag taxonomy—get started with a set of tags for your use case, from common symptoms in clinical trials to onboarding feedback for cloud products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project templates, insight templates, creative stickers, covers, and icons help you move faster and spruce up your research outputs. No matter your role, use case, or industry, there’s a template in the Dovetail community to kickstart your next research project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to templates, check out the Dovetail community for regular in-person events hosted all over the world. Find jobs, discuss best practices, share tips and tricks, and get support from over 6,000 people in &lt;a href=&quot;/community/&quot;&gt;our public Slack community workspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future is bright&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an exciting time to be in research. With more organizations embracing the value of insight-driven decision-making, and trends towards the democratization of the research practice—there is a lot to look forward to as more and more people conduct and consume research as a part of their day-to-day work. In 2023, Dovetail is proud to be supporting this growing community. We’re excited to take this next step with you all and look forward to delivering our vision for the future of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail in the details: 23 product improvements to lift your experience]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-the-details-23-product-improvements-to-lift-your-experience</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-in-the-details-23-product-improvements-to-lift-your-experience</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’re here to help you make better products, and it’s important we start in our own backyard by making Dovetail the best it can be. We’ve always been committed to quality and bringing delight to the way you work. Sometimes this means big, shiny new features that revolutionize how you approach your research craft. But more often, it’s the little things that really add up and make a difference over time. A tweak here, a polish there—our team is listening and sweating the details because we know even a one percent shift, made consistently, compounds in big ways for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the first in what will be many celebrations of the small things. In the details this edition, we’re sharing upgrades to canvas, new ways to filter your data, and some handy shortcuts to improve your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Canvas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Searching in canvas? Now use &lt;b&gt;⌘ F&lt;/b&gt; to quickly search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Outlines will track to your zoom so they’re visible up close or far away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The &lt;b&gt;Zoom&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Undo&lt;/b&gt; buttons are now easier to find&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. We’ve tweaked the background color to make cards more readable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. We’ve also added dots to the background so you don’t get lost in space&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Objects now snap to the grid so you can easily move and align them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fields, groups, and filters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Haven’t added fields to your notes yet? Use the &lt;b&gt;Uncategorized&lt;/b&gt; group!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Removing a filter is now intuitive with a trash can icon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Filter your insights by tag, tag group, or tag board to discover themes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. We’ve added a new creator field to notes or insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. Filter your notes, insights, and highlights by ‘Created by’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Boards, highlights, and insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. See the insights a highlight is already referenced in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13. You can now &lt;b&gt;Select all &lt;/b&gt;data in any project view to perform bulk actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14. Insights and note counts are now visible at a glance in board layout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uploads and video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;15. You can now import a CSV from Google Drive to tag boards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16. Drag and drop folders and files into notes, insights, and tags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17. Preview thumbnails for PDFs on notes and insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18. Now when you upload a video, it’ll play back instantly while processing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19. Press the new &lt;b&gt;Play&lt;/b&gt; button to start playback at a specific timestamp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other improvements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;20. Access your personal and workspace settings in the same place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21. We’ve cleaned up settings and combined integrations into one view&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22. Now it’s super fast to mark all notifications as read&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23. New handy shortcuts to save you from clicking and scrolling around!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more small improvements in the future! We love feedback too.

You’ve listened, understood, empathized, and summarized, all to get to that golden nugget of insight to focus your team on solving the most important customer problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a challenge. Focusing your team on the right problem requires buy-in, and buy-in requires insights stakeholders can trust. That’s why we’ve released five new features to make projects more powerful and help you focus your stakeholders’ attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simplify your sidebar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to have too much of a good thing. Particularly when your sidebar is starting to look like a laundry list of notes and highlights. You can now clean up your sidebar by grouping, hiding, and reordering your views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preview more file types&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add images and PDFs into notes, as well as insights. These new file types are deep searchable and can be displayed in their entirety as previews, or as more compact cards. Importing your files into projects is easier too—now you can simply drag and drop a folder of files into a view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hide fields&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t make your team endlessly scroll through your notes just to get to where the content starts. Quickly hide fields you don’t want to show so they can see the good bits at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create insights with impact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve simplified the editor toolbar to make formatting notes and insights a snap. Quickly embed up-to-date content into your insights, arrange and rearrange content, and highlight important points for your team. New layout, search block, and reference features in insights let you customize how your insight looks, while the ability to reference other insights from across your project or workspace helps you connect the dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insight engagement metrics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days of sending a PDF and hoping stakeholders get past the first page. Now, track how your insights have landed with likes, viewer read receipts, and more detailed engagement metrics coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope these improvements help you create more powerful projects, so you can spend more time delighting your customers and less time wondering if your stakeholders got past page two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love feedback too!

Ineffective home pages are poorly structured and unnecessarily complex, confusing stakeholders and researchers alike. Great homepages are structured and succinct, immediately signposting your stakeholders towards immediate value. In this guide we’ll dip into some principles for a great home page, ensuring your team’s research never gets lost, repeated, or wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principles for a great homepage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great homepages are simple and tightly structured. Structuring your research makes it easy for stakeholders to find what they need, and simplicity ensures your stakeholders don’t get overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have thousands of research objects—files, notes, highlights, and insights. Your first challenge is choosing how to group them. Optimally grouped information is MECE—mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. MECE grouping is made up of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutual exclusivity is a concept from probability theory that says two events cannot occur at the same time. When applied to information, mutually exclusive groups would be distinctly separate and not overlapping. For example, ‘generative’ and ‘evaluative’ are two mutually exclusive buckets of research; ‘qualitative’ and ‘interviews’ are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collectively exhaustive home page would include a group for anything that a stakeholder could possibly want. For instance, if you’ve chosen to group your research by persona, and your organization has identified five, a collectively exhaustive homepage would include them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simplicity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieter Rams, one of the most influential industrial designers in the modern era, created the 10 principles of good design. According to Rams, the tenth principle of a good design is “as little design as possible.” When it comes to presenting information, less is more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious tradeoff between simplicity and being collectively exhaustive. If your chosen grouping is too granular, being exhaustive will cause your home page to blow out in size. There is an art to choosing groupings that are granular enough to be useful, yet broad enough to maintain simplicity. Here are a few we’ve seen success with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer segment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer persona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job To Be Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research methodology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve decided on your groups, you can edit the home page by clicking &lt;b&gt;Edit home&lt;/b&gt; in the top right corner. From here, your toolbar will become visible. The toolbar lets you customize your page structure, content, and research objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blocks, blocks, blocks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine every piece of content you add to a page as a single building block, whether it’s text, an image, or a table of research. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want. Keep this in mind as you continue to build out your home page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make things newbie friendly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a clear &lt;b&gt;“Read me first”&lt;/b&gt; link is a great option for helping people onboard to your new insights hub. You can write your read-me within an insight, and link to it using the &lt;b&gt;Link&lt;/b&gt; button. It can be helpful to include information regarding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact information for your research team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief explanation of your research structure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Customize your layout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can customize the layout of your blocks by creating columns and adding dividers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating columns: &lt;/b&gt;To maximize your screen real estate with multiple columns, click and drag the &lt;b&gt;Layout &lt;/b&gt;button onto your page. From here, you can choose a two or three-column layout to flexibly display your research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adding dividers: &lt;/b&gt;To create clear boundaries between information, click and drag the &lt;b&gt;Divider&lt;/b&gt; button between two blocks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create your title and headers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great insights hub demands a great name, so be creative. To add plain text to your page, click and drag the &lt;b&gt;Text&lt;/b&gt; button. Dovetail supports four heading sizes—accessible in the sub-toolbar—helping you establish a clear information hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create signposts for stakeholders&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve decided on a layout, it’s time to put your structure into action. For instance, if you’ve decided to split your home page by customer segment, now is the time to make the decisions about the content you’d like to feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every organization, there is usually foundational research that new starters should get across. Examples might include personas, key user pains and gains, and overviews of your market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add specific insights, files, or highlights, click the &lt;b&gt;Add button.&lt;/b&gt; Use &lt;b&gt;Search&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Filters&lt;/b&gt; to zoom in on the most relevant information. You can filter by Files, Projects, Notes, Tags, Highlights, Insights or People.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spotlight fresh research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to a great home page is maintaining relevance. Once you’ve included foundational information that everyone should get across, it’s a good time to add a space for your freshest research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best tool for this is the &lt;b&gt;Search block.&lt;/b&gt; Search blocks are dynamic filter blocks, allowing you to feature research that matches certain conditions. Within the search block submenu, you can click &lt;b&gt;Template&lt;/b&gt; button for some inspiration. We have included templates that feature:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects your team is working on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently published insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent highlights for specific tags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rolling view of the freshest research in your repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a custom search block, click the &lt;b&gt;Filter&lt;/b&gt; button. You can chain together as many filters as you’d like to narrow in on your most important content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point, you’re well on your way to creating a simple, structured, and effective home page. That said, your home page can and should be continuously improved. Establish a learning loop with your key stakeholders to gather continuous feedback on your home page—each iteration will get you a step closer to their needs, and point your organization on a path towards research maturity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Privacy without pain: custom data retention is here]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/privacy-without-pain-data-retention-is-here</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/privacy-without-pain-data-retention-is-here</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Customer-centricity doesn’t stop at roadmaps and product strategy. Putting the customer at the center of how you work requires dedication to &lt;a href=&quot;/security/&quot;&gt;security and privacy&lt;/a&gt;. For people who do research, this means respecting the trust participants put in you the moment you hit record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protecting our customers’ PII is non-negotiable. It’s incredibly important to have good and consistent processes to accomplish that,” says Samaher Ramzan, UX Research at 1Password. “It isn&amp;#39;t just about meeting compliance and company policies, which is critical; it&amp;#39;s also about respecting our participants and customers who trust us with their data and share their experiences with us. We never do anything that would break that trust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we believe building the next great thing begins with earning your customers’ trust. We’re proud to introduce a new feature for Enterprise customers: &lt;b&gt;custom data retention&lt;/b&gt;. As part of the Enterprise plan, you can now protect your customers’ data without manual work by automating the deletion of original videos without losing the parts you’ve highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Privacy at every level&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa&quot;&gt;CCPA&lt;/a&gt; have brought PII into focus for governments, companies, teams, and individuals. Security can quickly become overwhelming as policies inevitably change and your research output grows. That’s why we’ve made the duration of data retention customizable—your retention period can evolve with your operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less busy work, more customer conversations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days of spending hours manually deleting old video files, hoping one didn’t slip through the cracks. Dovetail’s custom data retention allows you to set up default retention periods so that some or all of your videos are automatically deleted in your chosen timeframe. Then, easily adjust it based on the needs of your project. You’ll be able to spend less time on data management and feel confident that your customers’ sensitive information is protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s included in the custom data retention feature?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new custom data retention feature makes it as easy as possible for teams to comply with their data policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set a default retention period across your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customize retention periods on a project-by-project basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retain valuable data like highlights, reels, and transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extend retention thanks to pre-deletion notifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a step-by-step guide on how to set up and customize data retention for your workspace in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/custom-data-retention/&quot;&gt;help center&lt;/a&gt;.

Adoption was low, showing that we needed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uncover-stakeholder-perspectives-toward-research/&quot;&gt;understand stakeholder perspectives&lt;/a&gt; better before we created the next iteration of our strategy. In this post, I’ll explain how we used internal research to guide our next steps in the hopes that you’ll consider doing it, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The first step in our repository journey &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After deciding Dovetail was the right tool for us, one of the researchers on my team explored the platform and schooled the rest of us on the basics. As a team, we agreed that our stated goals for version one of our repository were two-fold: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To organize all of our research in a way that was easily accessible for our team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give stakeholders easier access to raw research data in a way that was organized by topic (for example, a Product Manager who was working on a specific feature could view insights, interview clips, and data around that feature via tags without having to watch full interviews or dig through project reports) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a scrappy but functional workflow and began inputting all of our data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/global-project-tags-taxonomy-research-repository/&quot;&gt;We tagged everything by topics&lt;/a&gt; that we thought were relevant for the majority of our stakeholders. 

We had initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/talking-tagging-taxonomies-bec-sareff-hibbert/&quot;&gt;ideas about taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; and started a Slack channel to discuss tagging situations as they came up. Once we’d found our groove, we presented the repository in Product meetings and also had short one-on-ones with relevant stakeholders to show them how to use the tool to find specific data and insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the feedback was amazing—stakeholders were excited by a searchable database with user insights, the ability to populate and watch interview clips without viewing full interviews, and so on. So you can imagine our relative surprise when, a few months later, we checked and saw very few stakeholders accessing the repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New employees often poked around and even watched some interviews, presumably to learn about our target audience and current users as they eased into their roles. We also saw a few members of the product team had entered a few times, but in a large organization like Lightricks, it was underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were a small research team investing considerable time in maintaining the repository. It was concerning that we had no clear indication that we were accomplishing our stakeholder-related goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the spotty usage by stakeholders, we also discussed the utility of the repository as a research team. Some of us found the process of tagging interviews helpful for our data analysis, and we all really appreciated the practicality of finding relevant clips via tags for our presentations without skimming whole interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also had a vague sense that having our insights and raw data in one transparent place was important. But we all agreed that for the repository to be worth the effort it took to maintain, we’d have to revisit the strategy with our stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team lead, I focused on our team’s overall goal with or without a repository: we want our stakeholders to further incorporate research findings and user insights into product development processes. I still had a feeling, and plenty of industry knowledge to back it up, that a repository could play a role in helping us move closer to our overall purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding stakeholder perspectives on the repository &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before iterating on our repository strategy, we needed to explain the gap between initial stakeholder excitement and subsequent limited usage. I did consider the possibility that people were &lt;i&gt;just being nice&lt;/i&gt;, but after going through the feedback that I’d diligently collected in a file, I had a hypothesis that there &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a will to use more nuanced information from our projects but that for whatever reason, our current repository structure wasn’t answering stakeholder needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to conduct short, relatively informal interviews to understand more from the stakeholder perspective. We spoke with Product Managers, Designers, Product Marketing Managers, and a few others. We asked both broad and specific questions to help us gather insights. Here are a few sample questions from our interview guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does user research play a role in your work? Why/Why not? How?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you think of a specific, recent example when you felt you were missing some information about users to make a decision or do your day-to-day work? Did you do anything to fill the knowledge gap?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you last accessed the repository, can you describe what you remember from the experience? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you were describing the repository to a new employee on your team, how would you describe it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What we learned from our internal stakeholder research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/plans/projects/&quot;&gt;analyzing our interview data&lt;/a&gt;, we came up with some core learnings about our first version of the repository from a stakeholder perspective. Here is a high-level summary of what we learned overall: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders across the board aspire to use more research insights and raw research data in their day-to-day work. They can easily identify specific areas where they lack knowledge about users. They can also provide examples of how that knowledge could have improved previously completed work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant barriers related to the repository prevent stakeholders from incorporating user insights in their day-to-day work. The top two are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is immense pressure on stakeholders to get things out quickly, and there is a pervasive perception that adding yet another tool to their workflow isn’t feasible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders are often looking for something very specific. The repository taxonomy doesn’t easily match the questions they’re asking themselves, so they aren’t sure how to find what they need quickly. For example, one Product Manager was working on onboarding. Because the app she worked on didn’t &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; onboarding, we didn’t have a specific tag in the repository. There is a ton of information in the repository that could guide her onboarding work: different user identities, use cases, and so on—but she wasn’t sure what to look for and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did we do with these insights?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our analysis, I felt a renewed empathy for stakeholders and motivation to create a repository strategy that fit within their constraints and advanced our team’s overall goals. I understood that we had one big decision to make before we created actual action items:  do we want to adjust the repository and educate stakeholders about how to use it better within their current workflows? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, do we want to use the repository &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; stakeholders when they need information and regard it as a tool for &lt;i&gt;the research team &lt;/i&gt;to better deliver the nuanced information that they’re looking for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at our repository and, more generally, our team’s involvement in product development as a journey. After reviewing our data, I concluded that the &lt;i&gt;next right step&lt;/i&gt; in our repository strategy is to do the latter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, we’re working on creating the second version of our strategic plan where we use the repository to make it easier for the research team to &lt;i&gt;serve&lt;/i&gt; information that helps stakeholders incorporate more user insights into their day-to-day work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach seems more likely to work within current stakeholder constraints, and it’s educational in that we’re showing the value of the information in the repository as we go. I foresee a time when stakeholders will utilize the repository in a more scalable way, with much less of our team’s involvement. Still, our internal research convinced me that we jumped the gun on making that our initial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Repositories are iterative and internal research can guide you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations change with time, and user research’s role in product development also grows and changes. Creating and maintaining a research repository isn’t immune to the need to continually check in and iterate on your work. Doing internal research—even if it’s scrappy and lean—can guide you when you aren’t quite sure that your current strategy is meeting needs and moving you closer to your team’s goals.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to use creative thinking in user research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/creative-thinking-user-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/creative-thinking-user-research</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I ask this question in my webinars or workshops, people often mention things like “creating novel connections or ideas”, or “trying new things”. And these are indeed great ways to nurture creativity. But one of the biggest factors contributing to creativity is the questions we ask.  Like Albert Einstein said, “Once I know the proper question I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our questions determine where we look for answers, so they determine the answers we will find too. Since creativity requires us to walk in new areas for unusual insights, our questions can help propel us toward areas that are unusual for us or for the problem at hand.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to share three examples of how questions help us think of creative approaches in user research and an exercise where you can brainstorm questions for your problem. Let&amp;#39;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brainstorm with stakeholders to arrive at a clear research question&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear and well-defined research question is essential to conducting a meaningful and impactful study. So when a team of user researchers got an initial brief where they were asked, “Can you do user research around accessibility for our website?” they found this brief to be too broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to their desk and formulating different research questions on their own, they decided to brainstorm with their team. They asked, “If you have the all-knowing user here and they could answer any of your questions, what would you ask them about this topic?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question helped the researchers see what their team actually wanted to know and where the gaps in their knowledge were. So they all brainstormed together and eventually arrived at a much better defined research question: “For whom does the product team need to create accessible design?”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, questions can be like Russian Dolls, they can be hidden inside one another and we can use one question to uncover new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using a question to develop a creative user research approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions can help us arrive at new and creative user research approaches. For example, consultancy twig and fish used a question to transform their user research approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally when we design interview scripts we focus on, “What should I ask? What’s the best way to ask this question?,” etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are valid questions, but once in a while we should ask questions that make us think beyond the script and make us question the study approach itself. Like the team members at twig and fish who observed that some people were not able to open up during studies or were likely to forget things. And this is human. To address this problem they asked themselves, “How do we enable people to recall their experiences and to help them open up during the study?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brought them to a new approach for conducting interviews. They used an activity as a “hook” into the conversation with people. For example, they would start the interview by asking people to fill in an empathy map around the topic of the interview. Once the participant had filled the map, they would walk the researchers through their map. This led to better data collection in multiple ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave people the time to collect their thoughts and to feel comfortable with being in a study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it empowered the participants when they were leading the conversation instead of being led by the researchers’ script&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using a question to change the way we share insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were going to present the results of a study where we had collected a lot of data on end-to-end workflow—almost a three- to four-meter long poster, with lots of details. We knew that people from higher management would be attending the presentation as well as designers who would use the insights. The people from the other teams or higher management would not stay until the end. And yet, they would be essential for prioritizing the design work. How could we present the findings impactfully?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To synthesize everything we had found, we asked, “If we had only five minutes, what would we say so that the team still knows what to follow up on?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We considered many different ideas for presentation of study results, for example, creating a garden of insights that people could walk through, playing bingo, recording mini-podcasts. As an aside, generating multiple ideas is another key ingredient for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually we selected the BLUF (Bottom Line Upfront) principle which says that we should communicate the bottomline of the information at the beginning, so that if anybody stops reading or listening midway, they still get the most important information within the first few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created a five minute summary of the results with three main topics and one example each, and these key examples showed the gist of the whole study. This might seem like a simple approach, but often simple solutions can be incredibly powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the presentation, my design colleagues told me that this was one of the best user research presentations they had been a part of. And later, I came to know that the study results were being used even one year after we completed the project. Like I said, simplicity is intertwined with creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ten question exercise to arrive at multiple questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to explore your problem space, here’s an exercise I created for you. It is called the “10Qs exercise” and it is inspired by the words of one of my writing teachers Giulietta “Julie” Nardone, who says, “There’s one rule that comedians use: The Power of 10. For some reason, it takes 10 attempts at anything to come up with something good. Push yourself to come up with 10 of everything...the first nine ideas are cliche. But the tenth ones and the ones after that cross into brilliance. The creative mind needs to be pushed and the only way to do that is to keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this exercise is to (re)frame the problem you are working on in at least 10 ways.  This will help you uncover new perspectives and sometimes may even turn your questions around completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Select any problem from work or life.&lt;/b&gt; For example, something you or people around you complain about often or a problem that keeps recurring, or a problem you have been procrastinating over, a research question, the goal of your next or last study, or the goal of your next presentation.&lt;i&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now try 10 or more different formulations of your problem in two minutes&lt;/b&gt;, all in one sitting. Do it quickly because working fast makes you let go and produce novel ideas. You can use the following prompts to get started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At first glance, I think the problem is…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But what I really want to find out is…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It would be funny if I ask…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the way we frame a problem or the way we ask questions determines where we look for answers. And questions can lead us to creative ways of determining the research questions, new study approaches, and change the way we engage with our stakeholders. So take the time to explore the problem landscape before settling on a solution, it will bring you to interesting destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions are key to creative thinking and in user research questions can help us think of new study approaches, better ways of communication, and articulate clearer research questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always begin a problem by first brainstorming on the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. You can use the 10Qs exercises for that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I leave you with the words of Keith Sawyer, a creativity researcher, who says, “Mastering [questions for creativity] means you’re always looking for good problems, always seeking new inspiration. You know where you’re going, and yet you’re receptive to questions that emerge unexpectedly”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Use a job atlas to share your JTBD Research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/job-atlas-share-jtbd-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/job-atlas-share-jtbd-research</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It enables you to understand people in a product-agnostic way and produces insights that allow you to innovate and improve your product based on actual needs.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;With this framework, you look at people and the things (jobs!) they try to accomplish. So, for example, let’s say the main job is listening to music. There are a million ways to create solutions to help people listen to music, but what do people &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; when it comes to listening to music? Your product is more likely to succeed when you create solutions based on needs and pain points.&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/framework-jobs-to-be-done/&quot;&gt; Jobs to be done&lt;/a&gt; helps you uncover those needs to develop better solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, using JTBD produces a lot of data. Sometimes, this amount of data can be hugely overwhelming. The most important and underrated part of research is effectively sharing your findings with colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, I had no idea how to share all this valuable information because—as we know—if it is hard to digest and use, it will die in a dusty Google Drive folder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enter: The Job Atlas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job atlas is a way to bring together different components of JTBD research and show their relationship, helping colleagues act on insights and findings. The job atlas clearly shows when certain behaviors lead to pain points and obstacles. This allows easy visualization of the aspects you need to work on to improve the users’ experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Job atlas components&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jobs atlas brings together four areas of Jobs to be done research and includes four different quadrants that represent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needs statements and motivations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviors and tasks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain points and obstacles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideal outcomes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at each component separately before putting them together to make this easier. And to help, we’re also going to use a specific example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine working at a travel company, and the main job you researched was booking a leisure trip. You’ve interviewed 17 people and pulled out the following smaller jobs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for a trip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing trip options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coordinating with others about the trip options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the ideal trip (considering: time, length, price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchasing the trip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Needs statements and motivations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step with a job atlas is to highlight needs statements and motivations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need statements concern getting the main job done (smaller jobs) and are success criteria that a user will face to complete the overall job. The way you write a needs statement is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Direction of change + unit of measure + object + clarifier &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You found the following needs statements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize the time it takes to book a roundtrip plane ticket for a leisure vacation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maximize the ability to compare different aspects of a trip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase the likelihood of booking the best trip option for the destination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce the risk of a concern occurring during a trip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize the effort it takes to coordinate with other travel companions when traveling with others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you move on to motivations, highlighting why it is vital for people to fulfill these needs. Let’s say you found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize the time it takes to book a roundtrip plane ticket for a leisure vacation -&amp;gt; to reduce stress and time spent booking the trip because of a busy schedule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maximize the ability to compare different aspects of a trip -&amp;gt; to make sure the best deal is chosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase the likelihood of booking the best trip option for the destination -&amp;gt; to stick to a budget or timeline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce the risk of a problem occurring during a trip -&amp;gt; to reduce stress/anxiety before and during the trip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize the effort it takes to coordinate with other travel companions when traveling with others -&amp;gt; to reduce time spent coordinating the trip because of a busy schedule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The needs and motivations lead to people’s tasks to achieve these goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Behaviors and tasks&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, you look at people’s behaviors and tasks to fulfill the various needs and achieve the overarching goal. In this area, you highlight the most common actions people take to complete the goal they set out to achieve. This section can include all types of behaviors, both digital and non-digital. For example, if we take the travel example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening multiple screens to compare different options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching on several websites to compare prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtering through the options (e.g., length, number of stopovers, time of arrival/departure)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorting by options such as price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking screenshots of the different options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending the travel group options via channels such as iMessage, email, or WhatsApp using screenshots or links&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading about travel insurance or cancellation policies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This area could get as granular as clicking on the “X” or “Y” button or ignoring specific content. Think of all the people’s actions to achieve their goals and list them out. If there are too many, pick the ten most crucial tasks people do to achieve the goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pain points and obstacles&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the fun part. Where are all the ways these actions can go wrong? What are all the obstacles or problems people encounter while trying to achieve their goal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the pain points and obstacles would be about the needs or the tasks you listed above. However, adding additional ones is okay if you find significant pain points that you can’t link to the most common behaviors and needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain points and obstacles are the essential part of the job atlas as they highlight:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where things are going wrong  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where you can improve your product/service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where you can innovate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the example from above for travel. I find the following pain points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can’t keep track of the different travel options easily and lose their place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices go up and down so quickly that options they send a group are often no longer valid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s challenging to keep track of screenshots and which ones they sent the group, resulting in taking a lot of time to organize &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel insurance and cancellation policies are often hidden and tough to find, with a lot of fine print, making these policies hard to trust&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information allows you to take action with the results. Some of the pain points might not be under your control to solve, but those that are can significantly improve users’ experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ideal outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the ideal outcome area is where you include what the user would define as success. What is the user hoping to achieve by using your product? What is their ideal outcome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section helps you understand where you are or aren’t supporting your users. For instance, if your product doesn’t support any of people’s ideal outcomes, you might experience retention rates drop, or you may struggle to acquire customers. The more ideal outcomes you support with your product, the more satisfied people will be. If you aren’t supporting ideal outcomes, this section is a great place to look for innovation and improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, let’s take an example of ideal outcomes (which look a lot like needs statements):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book a trip with others quickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easily share trip options with others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easily gather trip options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchase the best trip efficiently &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel confident that you are booking the best trip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filter through the noise and find the best option quickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bringing it all together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you finished each section, you can put them together into an atlas, where they relate to each other. This visualization can easily show the relationships between needs, motivations, and behaviors and how those behaviors can lead to either pain points or ideal outcomes. Once you create the atlas, you can use it to see where your company does or does not support your user. I do this using a one-to-five scale; one is not supported, and five is very supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the job atlas is a great way to visualize your top findings from your study and help encourage your team to take action on the most critical insights. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New features to speed up analysis when customer feedback feels like a firehose]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/speed-up-analysis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/speed-up-analysis</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The blessing is that you don’t have to read your customers’ minds; they’re telling you exactly what they want! This means when you action feedback customers are delighted, NPS scores improve, and churn decreases. The burden is that when feedback is plentiful, it can feel like more work than it’s worth to separate the signal from the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of feedback, a major theme we are hearing from Dovetail customers is you need a solution to make tagging high volumes of feedback more efficient. Ask and you shall receive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Import all-at-once or automatically&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all of your feedback is stuck in one unruly spreadsheet, you’ll love what we just built. As of this week, &lt;b&gt;import up to 5,000 rows of feedback in a few clicks&lt;/b&gt; and instantly turn all of your feedback into notes to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For teams who manage feedback across multiple channels, &lt;a href=&quot;/help/connect-apps-to-dovetail-with-zapier/&quot;&gt;our integration with Zapier&lt;/a&gt; will be your best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For when you want to analyze every piece of feedback at once&lt;/b&gt;, you can automatically Zap each response (NPS, CSAT, surveys, etc) from your collection tool directly into a note in Dovetail. &lt;a href=&quot;/help/import-data-with-a-zapier-action/&quot;&gt;Learn how&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For community feedback sources like Twitter and Slack&lt;/b&gt;, you can set up Zapier so that you are in control of what feedback items you want to Zap to Dovetail for analysis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/export-data-with-a-zapier-trigger/&quot;&gt;Learn how&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Analyze consistently&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start tagging, make sure you know what you’re looking for by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/tag-across-projects-with-workspace-tags/&quot;&gt;creating workspace tags&lt;/a&gt;. Using tags across different projects in your workspace means that any researcher in any project is empowered to productively contribute to your ongoing customer feedback analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Tag in bulk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing, the ability to search for keywords, feature names, customer names, or NPS responses in your project and use multi-select to quickly highlight notes and add tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new enhancement to our tagging feature will enable you to quickly quantify which feedback themes are coming up the most frequently, without having to read every piece of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Edit more fields at once&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#39;re on the topic of bulk tagging, did you know you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/add-structured-data-with-fields/#:~:text=their%20display%20order.-,Create%20and%20update%20field%20data%20in%20bulk,-You%20can%20update&quot;&gt;edit fields in bulk&lt;/a&gt; too? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fields enable you to organize content across notes, insights, and people so you can pick up patterns across your research. As your research evolves, so too can the fields you need which is why we&amp;#39;ve made them more flexible. Now you can quickly update one, many, or all fields at once using our bulk actions menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step 5: Synthesize collaboratively&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tagging done and fields updated! Now it’s time to action your organized chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip: Bring the people responsible for actioning feedback into the synthesis process.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of your feedback organized into tags, it’s time to share the feedback with your team and translate customer wishes and complaints into a prioritized task list. In the old days, you might turn your notes into stickies, book a meeting, and gather around a whiteboard to pick out the themes and low-hanging fruit. With Dovetail, you can now skip those cumbersome scheduling steps &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; take customer empathy viral with hard hitting, evidence-based data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introducing new find and follow features in canvas view&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying and prioritizing evidence-backed opportunities with your team is now easier than ever. Within Dovetail’s whiteboard view, canvas, you can now follow a user’s cursor when you’re collaborating live. Plus when there are lots of highlights, notes, or insights and you want to find something specific, you can now search content within the stickies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope these improvements help you quickly analyze your data, so you can spend more of your precious time delighting your customers and less time separating the signal from the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love feedback too!

We were two former Atlassian employees who wanted to ditch the organizational chaos of a big company and focus on what we loved—making great products. The only thing you could call a “purpose” was the first long-term company goal we set for ourselves—to build a product with a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we raised money to scale Dovetail, we never sold investors on a high-level mission or company purpose—we always let the product speak for itself. In our founder interviews, I would tell candidates that my purpose was to come in every day and do work I could be proud of—and I invited them to do the same. We formed values as a company, and we let them guide us internally on &lt;u&gt;how&lt;/u&gt; we should do work without worrying too much about &lt;u&gt;why&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short: we’ve always been about the product and the impact it can have on our customers’ lives. And we still are. But as we scale (we’re nearing the 100 headcount mark), we’re also starting to think about the impact we can have on the wider world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our new company purpose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a plurality of voices, opinions, talents, and minds joining us at a rapid rate, we felt that we needed a clear and simple constraint that ensures no matter how large we grow or who the constituents of the company are, Dovetail will remain true to its DNA. We need a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a leaders retreat around the time of our fifth birthday, Brad and I took a step back from the day-to-day of running a startup to reflect on what we’d achieved, and what more we hoped to accomplish in the coming years. We considered what our purpose might be. We didn’t want marketing fluff—it had to come from an authentic place. Our purpose needed to reflect what we value and the way we did things. After thinking deeply about what we are doing in the world and the impact we have on our customers, we landed on something that resonated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world will be a better place if more organizations embrace a customer-centric mindset. Customer-centricity produces higher quality products and services, which often meaningfully improve people’s lives. From the obviously impactful products like a Cochlear implant that helps children and adults hear for the first time through to everyday crowd-pleasers like Canva who delight and inspire their customers to design, the world is shaped by thoughtful innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path to customer-centricity begins with world-class research—and Dovetail is uniquely positioned to help with this. Through the power of customer research, we help our customers create better products for people to use, better experiences for users to engage with, and better services for the public to rely on. The products we build help organizations understand their customers better. And customer understanding is simply a means to an end—the end is creating better things. So our new company purpose is simply that Dovetail exists to improve the quality of every &lt;u&gt;thing&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why have a purpose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at the highest performing teams and organizations around the world, there’s a common theme—a purpose that acts as a non-negotiable constraint. It’s a north star that ensures no matter how an organization might change, it will always remain true to its core principles. In our case, that’s delivering the best products possible for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We like our purpose because it’s lofty but also actionable, and we strongly believe it will help us serve our customers better. The only way we can achieve the goal of improving the quality of every thing is through **our customers. Only when we support organizations in every sector and industry around the world by equipping them with the best tools for understanding their customers can we deliver on our purpose. Our customers are making the world a better place, and we’ve made it our mission to ensure their success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for the future?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Externally, not much will change. We’ll continue to build high-quality products that enable our customers to improve their products and services. However, this new perspective helps us align our efforts internally, ensuring decisions are always moving us closer to our goal of improving the quality of every thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is a support player—to be successful, we must continue to grow and discover new ways to improve our customers’ lives, so they in turn can improve the lives of their customers. If we’re successful, Dovetail will often be the first thing teams check to get a pulse on their customers when they start their day or to see the latest research through a continuous, personalized stream of customer data and insights. We will help organizations maximize their potential, delight customers, and innovate on quality products and experiences driven by the power of research. Organizations that adopt Dovetail will see a step-change improvement in how they work, how decisions are made, and how things are prioritized. They will be more competitive and commercially successful because we help them create quality things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, our customers use Dovetail to improve the quality of educational material in schools, the experience of prison leavers reintegrating into society, and the usability of popular software products. We have customers across government, technology, consumer products, manufacturing, education, healthcare, art and culture, philanthropy, non-profits, and more. Dovetail exists to help every one of these customers build better things, and if they successfully do that, the impact on the world is massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future is an exciting place—we hope you will join us on our journey. And more importantly, we want you to keep us accountable to our goal. We may not know what Dovetail will look like in five, ten, or fifteen years. But with your help and a dedicated drive towards our purpose, we’re certain we’ll be shaping the world in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting started with Jobs to be Done]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/framework-jobs-to-be-done</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/framework-jobs-to-be-done</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is one of those controversial topics like personas or the NPS. Some people hate Jobs to be Done, some swear by it, and others are confused about how to do it. Because it’s a polarizing framework, there’s a lot of contradictory information out there. For example, when I first dove into Jobs to be Done, my Google searches left my head spinning. One person said it was a useless tactic, another noted that you had to form job statements in one particular way, and another said that the switch interview was the only thing you should be doing when it came to JTBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I bounced around, not knowing how to use the JTBD framework properly. So, I avoided it. Whenever a stakeholder recommended or mentioned using Jobs to be Done, I shied away, stating that a different methodology would be better. My biggest fear was undertaking a JTBD project and, in the end, not finding any jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I couldn’t hide from JTBD any longer. A project came along, and it was the perfect opportunity for Jobs to be Done, even to the point where &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; didn’t believe my arguments against using the framework. So, I rolled up my sleeves, read way too many books and articles, and set forth into the JTBD universe. I came out on the other side and want to help you do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First, what is Jobs to be Done?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobs to be Done is not a magic pill or some completely new and unheard-of methodology. I don’t even classify JTBD as a methodology, but more of a framework, as the method you use during JTBD is one-on-one interviews. Instead, Jobs to be Done is a framework and mindset you use when interviewing users or non-users. At the beginning of the project, you decide to overlay this framework on your approach and deliverables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobs to be Done looks at people and the things (jobs!) they try to accomplish. It is product-agnostic research. Let’s take an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My big goal (main job) is to cook a meal for my family. Within that larger goal, there is a process I might go through, such as checking for allergies, deciding what to cook, and buying groceries (smaller jobs). With these smaller jobs come needs, such as minimizing the amount of time the meal will take to cook or increasing the likelihood people will like the meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you take a larger goal, break it into smaller parts, and look at the needs associated with smaller parts. Now, this is taking a complex framework and simplifying it. Additional caveats include what job level you want to look at, such as a vast, aspirational job versus preparing a meal. Choosing this is deciding the level at which you want to innovate. I always avoid going for overly aspirational jobs because it can be challenging to focus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, let’s see how this works in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use Jobs to be Done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to use JTBD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I worked at a travel company, we decided Jobs to be Done would be a great next step for the organization. I chose to use JTBD for this project to understand our users’ goals and needs, &lt;i&gt;agnostic&lt;/i&gt; of our product. It wasn’t about how our product fit into their lives (or didn’t), but rather how they thought about, made decisions, and considered travel on a higher level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;JTBD is an excellent framework to help you take a step back from your product and understand people’s lives, thoughts, and processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also enables you to innovate by finding and examining peoples’ actual needs and building solutions based on that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this project, our objectives included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify opportunities for innovation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examine and address the market to provide value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand users’ needs, pain points, and overarching goals outside of our product &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a positive movement in success metrics for the business (in particular, we looked at increasing conversion rate, click-thru rate; and reducing bounce rate and customer support calls)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our main job was booking a leisure trip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Segmenting before JTBD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before jumping right into JTBD, you need to do some segmentation, just like any other generative research method. As I was looking at travel, I decided to segment between leisure travel rather than different types of travel, such as for work, visiting family, etc. Essentially, I focused on people who were going on a holiday. I also limited it to people without children as we found, in previous research, a massive difference in the way people think about and decide on leisure travel when including children. I then focused on the person exploring, searching for, and booking the trip as it would get me the most information on the journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this is generative research, you need a larger sample size per segment (another great reason to segment!). The ideal range is no less than 12 and no more than 25. For this project, I spoke to 15 leisure travelers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conducting JTBD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, JTBD is a framework, not a method. One of the most common methods used for JTBD is 1x1 interviews. In-depth interviews allow you to use open-ended questions and explore these concepts from an unbiased point of view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sample questions you can use to understand “jobs” are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you trying to accomplish? What tasks are involved in this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What problems are you trying to resolve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you get started?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the previous/next step?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you feel at each stage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you dread doing? What tasks do you avoid?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is most frustrating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What hacks or workarounds do you use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the environment or others impact you getting X job done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Finding jobs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our big job was booking a leisure trip, we had to find the process and smaller jobs associated with this bigger goal. So, after the research, we went through and highlighted everything that contributed to that primary goal, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for a trip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing trip options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coordinating with others about the trip options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the ideal trip (considering: time, length, price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchasing the trip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other jobs came from the study (I once had a JTBD with over 100), but the best thing you can do is break up the main job into smaller steps. Once you finish the research, go through and pick out all the different things people tried to do to achieve that goal and focus on those. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Creating needs statements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needs help us understand why people act the way they do while trying to accomplish their primary job. Need statements concern getting the main job done and are success criteria a user will face while completing the job. The way we formulated needs statements based on Lance Bettencourt’s and Anthony Ulwick’s desired outcome statements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;direction of change + unit of measure + object + clarifier &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direction of change&lt;/b&gt; is how the job performer wants to improve conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unit of measure&lt;/b&gt; is the metric for success (such as time, effort, and skill)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objects&lt;/b&gt; are the objects/concepts that the job will impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clarifiers&lt;/b&gt; are contextual clues that provide descriptions of circumstances surrounding the job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created these need statements based on those smaller jobs we identified above. So, the smaller tasks that contribute to the main job get converted to needs statements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize the time it takes to book a roundtrip plane ticket for a leisure vacation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maximize the ability to compare different aspects of a trip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase the likelihood of booking the best trip option for the destination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce the risk of a problem occurring during a trip &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize the effort it takes to coordinate with other travel companions when traveling with others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Grade yourself&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These needs statements then become your inspiration for innovation and creating solutions. With these needs statements, you understand what the user is trying to accomplish in a given situation. The next step is to grade yourself on how your organization or product does/does not support people’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s take: &lt;i&gt;maximize the ability to compare different aspects of a trip. &lt;/i&gt;Based on our current platform, I would rate from one to five how well we do or do not support the user during this step, one being completely unsupported to five being completely supported. Using this, you can see the gaps in how you help people (or don’t) with their needs and begin to innovate and improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritizing needs statements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a bunch of needs statements and have graded yourself, you might have to take one more step to prioritize which are most important to your users. For this, you can send out an opportunity gap survey to help prioritize the most important statements. In this survey, you ask the participant to rate each statement on two scales:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of the statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The satisfaction of the current offering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimize the effort it takes to coordinate with other travel companions when traveling as a group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is this to you? (1 = very unimportant; 7 = very important)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How satisfied are you with the ability to get this done? (1 = very unsatisfied; 7 = very satisfied)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use these answers to calculate your opportunity score, which is the importance minus the satisfaction. The higher the opportunity score, the higher the priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Innovating and improving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done the above, the fun part comes. I take the top three unsupported and most prioritized needs and hold an ideation workshop. During this workshop, you begin to design potential solutions to your users’ needs. Then, you run a series of usability tests to ensure you are on the right path. With this approach, you are prioritizing and helping to support the most critical needs of your users, creating a more satisfactory product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a great (and non-controversial) resource, check out Jim Kalbach’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/jobs-to-be-done-book/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jobs to be Done Playbook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This book helped me connect the dots and conduct better JTBD research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to choose the right research methods for your discovery process]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-method-discovery-product-management</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-method-discovery-product-management</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Discovery is a vital part of product management. But equally important is choosing the correct methodology and researching to the right level of detail. Too much, and you risk getting stuck in analysis paralysis or losing the trust of stakeholders for moving too slowly. Too little, and you expose the company to financial or reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also be challenging to get stakeholders on board with discovery and align them on what activities are part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://productcraft.com/best-practices/a-tried-and-true-framework-for-prioritizing-user-research/?utm_content=205073924&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lis-lg-pm9wYwp&quot;&gt;this framework&lt;/a&gt; by Jeanette Fuccella. It does a great job of clarifying what kind of research is right for each situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you’ll see, each quadrant has a description of the broad types of research that yield enough insight to build the right thing and mitigate the risk of getting it wrong without falling into the trap of analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s easy to understand, providing a simple way to explain to stakeholders what level of research you’re going to do in discovery and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People we’ve taught the framework to love it but generally wanted more detail on specific examples of types of research they could use in each quadrant, so here they are. In this article, we’ll explore how this framework can help you choose what &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques/&quot;&gt;types of research&lt;/a&gt; to use in discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The axes: Problem clarity and risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by learning our way around the framework. It’s a simple two-by-two set out along two axes: problem clarity and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The y-axis of the framework is problem clarity. High problem clarity means you understand the customer problem and have plenty of research to support that understanding. Low means you don’t understand the customer problem yet—or if there is a problem at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also think of this in terms of the problem and solution space. The lower half of the framework is the problem space—discovery to understand customer problems and which to solve. The upper half is the solution space—discovery to understand how you might solve a customer problem or how well a solution you’ve already come up with solves the customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The x-axis is risk—the risk of getting it wrong. It’s important to align on what risk means when using this framework. It can refer to financial risk and opportunity costs associated with building the wrong thing and the reputational cost of building something your customers dislike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High problem clarity, low risk: Ship it and measure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are clear on the problem to solve for the customer, and there’s a relatively low risk of getting your solution wrong (for example, an incremental improvement to an existing feature), the most effective option is usually to ship it and measure how real users interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before shipping, make sure you have success metrics clearly articulated and a means of actually collecting and analyzing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that only using one of these methods may not give you the full picture, so you may want to consider using a combination of the following methods to gather your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A/B testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Testing two variants of the product or feature side by side to observe the differences in user behavior.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use A/B testing when choosing between alternative ideas.&lt;/b&gt; When you have a hypothesis that you can reduce to one variable, an A/B test is a great way to understand the impact of changing that variable. This might mean running a new version of a feature alongside the existing version or a completely new feature implemented in two slightly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Intercept surveys&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A survey or a single question triggered at a particular point in the customer journey to gather data on whether what you’ve built is working.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use intercept surveys to get immediate feedback and separate that sentiment from the entire product experience.&lt;/b&gt; Bear in mind the observer effect when you are using this method—by interrupting the process, you might bias responses somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Customer feedback&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Feedback channels for gathering customers’ broad opinions on the product (star ratings, NPS, customer service queries, etc.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use customer feedback when looking for unexpected negative impact.&lt;/b&gt; Use your existing customer feedback channels (star ratings, contact, etc.) to determine what they think of what you shipped and track trends in that data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clickstream analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aggregated or individual data that shows what users click and in what order.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use clickstream analysis to understand how something impacts the entire journey.&lt;/b&gt; Whether you’re looking at aggregated data or individual customer interactions (using Hotjar or similar), seeing how people actually use the feature in real life gives you a great deal of insight into how effectively you’ve addressed the customer problem and if there are ways to optimize the solution further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eyetracking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tracking the eye line of users on the screen while they’re using a digital product.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use eye tracking to find out what captures people’s attention or where they’re getting stuck.&lt;/b&gt; We don’t all have eye-tracking technology available, but if your UX team uses this method, it can tell you what people find important (or struggle to locate) in your solution. For those of us without access to eye-tracking tech, recording mouse movement on each page can yield similar information with a lower barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Product usage metrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Metrics that show which users are using the product, what they do with it, and how often.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use product usage metrics to decide if what you built drives the right outcomes&lt;/b&gt;. Before you ship what you’ve built, you’ll undoubtedly have many success metrics that will tell you if it worked. General usage metrics can be a good indicator of how valuable your product is to the customers (i.e., if they use it, it’s likely of value).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High problem clarity, high risk: Design heavy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the problem you’re solving for the customer is clear, but there’s more risk if you get it wrong, it makes sense to use research methods that involve designing and testing your solution before building it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more time-consuming to work this way but worth it to mitigate risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the research types you could use if you’re working in this quadrant are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prototypes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A working low-fidelity version of the product you intend to build that you can test with users. The level of risk and clarity will likely dictate the level of fidelity in your prototype. The following are common varieties of prototype:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paper prototype. A paper representation of your solution that you can discuss and test with users.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Clickable mock-up. Using Figma or similar to link designs so that people can click through to different pages as they would on a real site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mechanical Turk. Build the user interface, then do the ‘automated’ background steps by hand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No/low-code working prototype. Use simple no/low-code tools such as bubble, Airtable, and Webflow to make a working prototype of the part of your solution that you want to test.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use prototypes when you want to test an idea that is too difficult to explain to customers without them trying it.&lt;/b&gt; A classic example of this is the iPod—it would have been challenging to understand whether people could use it without making a prototype. The same is true for most novel interactions. If your research needs users to “imagine” what it would be like to use something, you should probably make a prototype of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: Because this framework is about prioritizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;user research&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve talked about prototypes from that perspective, but prototyping is also an excellent way to ideate possible solutions or explore technical feasibility of different solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;User experience studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Observing and analyzing how users interact with your product or its prototype.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conduct user experience studies when you want to understand how people interact with your product or prototypes.&lt;/b&gt; Depending on your challenge and the available resources, this might range from simply observing a user following a test script when interacting with your product (or prototype) to fully benchmarked tests comparing with competitors and usability or accessibility standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Participatory design (co-design)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Designing a solution in collaboration with users, for example, having them suggest what goes where, which elements of a design work with them, and what would work better.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use participatory design when your users know the problem better than you.&lt;/b&gt; For example, architects and town planners hold design consultations with local residents to flush out the elements of their designs that might go wrong. Or, in digital products, having users card sort or write their own titles or instructions on pages gives you an insight into their understanding of the problem that’s difficult to elicit with other research methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Desirability studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Testing the desirability of your solution by showing it to customers and seeing whether they like it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use desirability studies to gather opinions or test perceived value without building the solution.&lt;/b&gt; It’s most effective to test desirability by having customers commit to buying one of the options presented. You can do this with a “fake door”—a landing page where people sign up for a waiting list to buy the product before it’s actually built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low problem clarity, low risk: Research light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have low problem clarity, you need to focus your discovery efforts on the problem space. However, when there is little risk attached to what you are building, it makes sense to keep the research to a minimum before exploring solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key questions to answer at this time are “Does this problem exist?” and “Is this problem worth solving?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re working in this space, the following research methods should give you enough detail in a short length of time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Email surveys&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A survey, usually with multiple-choice or scale-based questions sent out to users or potential users by email.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use email surveys to learn about users’ behaviors and attitudes, and when you know the problem well enough to write good questions.&lt;/b&gt; If you struggle to write questions that users can easily answer with multiple choice or a scale, you should probably do some more interviews first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lightweight interviews&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Short interviews with a few broad, open questions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use lightweight interviews when you need to understand the problem quickly&lt;/b&gt;. These are similar to guerrilla research—like catching customers outside a shop for quick questions about a product or brand. While not strictly a rule of thumb to follow, you’ll likely start to notice patterns that help you understand the problem once you’ve interviewed five to eight people, so there is no need for extensive recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Card sorting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Having users rank, order, or group cards with elements of your problem or solution written on them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use card sorting to understand how users’ mental models of a problem or solution are structured.&lt;/b&gt; For example, you could use cards with topics on them and have users group them into categories that make sense to them, then use that to structure the navigation of your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low problem clarity, high risk: Research heavy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the area that will likely involve the highest level of effort. When you’re working in the problem space, don’t understand the customer problem yet, and a lot is riding on what you build, you need to start at the beginning and research in plenty of detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means using classic discovery methods to unpack the problem in its broadest sense and then continuing to research with increasing focus to hone in on the area of the problem you want to solve for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following research methods will likely be most useful when working on a challenge of this type:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interviews&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One-on-one discussions in which potential customers answer a prepared question set and the interviewer has time and flexibility to explore interesting or unexpected answers in more detail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use interviews to gather rich information about the problem space.&lt;/b&gt; The level of structure in your interviews depends on how well you already understand the problem space. When you have little understanding of the problem, broader exploratory questions about the situations in which customers are likely to be looking for a solution are most helpful. The interviews tend to become more structured and scripted as you understand the problem better. While not necessarily quick when compared with research-light methodologies, interviews yield more immediate results than comprehensive ethnographic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However you conduct your interviews, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/products/markup&quot;&gt;make sure to keep both a summary and transcript or recording of the interview&lt;/a&gt;. Often small comments that might not be relevant to the current problem you are solving will be useful in the future as your understanding of the problem space continues to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Focus groups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Facilitated group discussions about a product or user problem. Usually recorded or observed by the researchers and facilitated by someone else.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use focus groups to understand the general consensus on a topic and how people present their feelings about it when talking to peers.&lt;/b&gt; Focus groups are a useful way of gathering attitudinal research in a relatively short space of time. They are also less prone to participants giving answers that “please the interviewer” than one-on-one interviews—especially when facilitated by someone not directly connected to the product and observed on camera or through one-way glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that focus groups tend to yield the “general opinion” on matters rather than people’s individual detailed views. So if you want to go into more detail or talk about potentially sensitive issues, interviews might be a more appropriate tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diary / camera studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Participants write or record a diary based on prompts written by the researcher.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-diary-study/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diary or camera studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; are perfect for understanding how your product might fit within the user’s world.&lt;/b&gt; To make sure you get the most out of diary studies, make the prompts as specific and easy to understand as you can, and make the information capture methods as easy as possible for participants. For example, if they are too busy to write things up, let them send you voice messages for their diary entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ethnographic field studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mixture of research methods mentioned above with a focus on studying participants in the environment where they would naturally encounter the problem you’re looking to solve. For example, shadowing participants for a few days to understand how they live or work, unpacking areas of interest with more detailed interviews or studies, or simply going out and observing how customers buy or use your products.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use ethnographic field studies to understand the environment and context in which someone might use your product.&lt;/b&gt; Because of its academic-sounding name, people often assume ethnographic research needs to be done by a dedicated researcher. While that might be true for large-scale studies, basic field study techniques are simple enough for most product folks. In fact, you likely do it already to a certain extent when talking to customers... (You do talk to customers, don’t you?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In summary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right level of depth and research types for your discovery process is a challenge, but thinking of it in terms of risk and problem clarity should help you make a more effective decision on how to approach it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the framework in this article should help you hit the “Goldilocks” sweet spot of the right amount of discovery to move ahead with confidence and learn what you need to deliver value to your customers. It’s really easy to get started, so why not try using it with some of the challenges you’re working on and see what discovery methods are most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Robin Zaragoza, Founder and CEO, The Product Refinery. &lt;/b&gt;Founder and CEO at &lt;a href=&quot;http://theproductrefinery.com/&quot;&gt;The Product Refinery&lt;/a&gt;, Robin has been working in tech for 20 years and delivering product for the last 15 of those at companies of various sizes, from early-stage start-ups where she was the first product manager, to large publicly traded companies where she led teams of product managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin founded The Product Refinery, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theproductrefinery.com/articles/what-is-product-coaching&quot;&gt;product coaching&lt;/a&gt; company, to help product people further their skills and empower product teams to do their best work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to conduct unmoderated user testing]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/unmoderated-user-testing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/unmoderated-user-testing</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Unmoderated user research gets a bad rap. There are about a million ways it can go wrong, and you should only use it in particular situations. However, unmoderated usability tests can be a lifesaver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timelines have often run short, and I&amp;#39;ve had to lean out my approach to user research. For a while (and of course still, when necessary), I fought hard against timelines. I didn&amp;#39;t give my colleagues much choice when they asked me how we could speed up the research. If we couldn&amp;#39;t squeeze usability testing into the timeline, I suggested we do it another time or extend the timeline. Many of my colleagues were frustrated with the confines of user research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, one of my managers mentioned trying an unmoderated study. I shook my head and turned down the idea. In my mind, and with what I heard, unmoderated tests were a waste of time. They returned a bunch of noise or low-quality data and often left teams frustrated by confusing results. And, for some time, I refused to use unmoderated testing. I had tried it once with disastrous results and biased my perspective with horror stories from other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I got stuck. I had several usability tests that I &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to run. I needed to have the findings ready quickly. My back was against the wall, and I finally turned toward unmoderated usability testing and found that it wasn&amp;#39;t all bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I am not the only one who has way too much to do and not nearly enough time. I’ve watched as many time-poor designers and product managers attempt to do full-blown research studies, on the side of their full-time job. While it can work, it is not always possible, and unmoderated user testing is a fantastic way for you to save time while still gathering useful data from your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First, what is unmoderated user testing?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmoderated testing gets a bad reputation because of how it works: there is no moderator during the test. Instead, you create your usability test and let it out into the wild. Participants record themselves and answer your questions or do the assigned tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of faith when you create and send out an unmoderated user test. You trust participants to think aloud, respond well to the questions, understand tasks, correctly use the prototype, and properly record themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you pick the right situation and create an unmoderated test, you can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gain a large amount of feedback in a short amount of time. For example, I often run unmoderated tests from Friday to Monday, so the tests primarily run over the weekend with zero effort&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend less money since unmoderated tests require less effort from everyone involved and are often much shorter than moderated tests (think: 10-20 minutes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a diverse participant base as unmoderated tests are run remotely &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean out a research process, get results faster, and shorten timelines &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are some downfalls to unmoderated testing. I&amp;#39;ve encountered many of these, especially when I try to force unmoderated testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the test is unmoderated, you have no control over how the participants respond to the test and no way to follow up in terms of explaining a task or asking them why they did something in a certain way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it is so easy to join a test, you can get people who don&amp;#39;t say anything and barely participate to get the &amp;quot;reward&amp;quot; at the end, contributing to useless data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical problems can occur, such as the participant not correctly recording themselves, leading to blank sessions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the participant is confused and misinterprets the task or question, there is no way to backtrack or explain, which can lead to confusing results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants can often forget to think aloud so that you will have actions with little explanation or feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the most significant risk with unmoderated tests is ending with useless or confusing data. Luckily, if we choose unmoderated testing for the right situation, we can reduce this risk considerably. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When (and when not) to use unmoderated testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, there is a time and a place for unmoderated user testing. Now, I only use unmoderated testing when the situation calls so that I can mitigate some of the limitations of unmoderated usability testing. I use unmoderated user testing when I need to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test a simple, straightforward, and short prototype to test, usually with one clear path&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather feedback on small components or design changes (kind of like an A/B test)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather surface feedback, such as what people are doing and their initial reactions versus why they are doing something&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify how minor bugs or issues we uncovered impact a larger sample size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determine the value proposition or initial reaction of a design or brand &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, you can&amp;#39;t just switch out moderated testing for unmoderated testing. This approach is entirely unhelpful when you need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep feedback or understanding on a topic, since your tasks or questions need to be simple and you can&amp;#39;t follow up during unmoderated testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test a complex product or prototype with many different paths that could confuse the user or take a long time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test a very early stage idea, as there is no moderator to explain the limitations of the prototype - make sure it is a clickable flow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong emotional reactions or processes because participants are &amp;quot;in charge,&amp;quot; and it is challenging to get people to articulate their feelings and processes without a facilitator &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, that being said, here are the most common goals that led me to choose unmoderated user testing (not all of these at once, however, because, remember, unmoderated tests need to be short and focused):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determine usability issues with a simple prototype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncover the larger impact of bugs/issues on a product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand if users can find relevant information or do simple tasks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover if participants understand the point (value proposition) of your product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to create an unmoderated test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your goals align with an unmoderated test, your next step is to create one. Once you have identified your target audience, created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/seven-steps-to-writing-a-screener-survey-1c75cf19c585&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;screener survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and picked what you will test, it&amp;#39;s time to hop into the fun part (at least, for me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Writing unmoderated tasks and questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of an unmoderated test is correctly writing tasks or questions. This is because they are a crucial part of the success of your unmoderated test. If you send poorly written tasks or questions for participants to respond to, you can get biased or confusing results. There are a few rules to adhere to when writing great questions or tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give participants some background and context on why they need to use the product, such as why they would use it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If users need to input dates, locations, or particular data in a form, give them that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asking someone to accomplish a task, make sure they can. There should be a reachable &amp;quot;end,&amp;quot; which satisfies the participant and helps you record if the participants could complete the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be direct by telling them what you need them to do (or don&amp;#39;t want them to do)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid using biased or leading language, especially language already on the interface. For example, if you want people to hit the &amp;quot;register&amp;quot; button, instead ask them to &amp;quot;sign-up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break up a larger task into several different steps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remind them, a few times, to think aloud during the entire time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate these best practices, let&amp;#39;s look through some examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example one: &lt;/b&gt;Brand Jeans, a fictional clothing company (b2c)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User goal: &lt;/b&gt;Browsing for and purchasing a pair of jeans, the average jeans price is $50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad task: &lt;/b&gt;Find black, boot-cut jeans in your size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better task: &lt;/b&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking for a new pair of Brand jeans. Go to brandjeans.com and buy a pair of jeans for $50 or under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a delicate balance between specificity and allowing the participant to act as they would in the real world. The bad task is too specific, asking people to find black, boot-cut jeans. Forcing the participant down this path may cause them to act like they are doing the task rather than how they would typically operate. If you give them the freedom to compare different types of jeans and provide a parameter ($50 or under), they can act more naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example two: &lt;/b&gt;Stay Here, a fictional hotel (b2b)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User goal: &lt;/b&gt;Uploading photos of the hotel grounds and rooms to the Stay Here platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad task: &lt;/b&gt;You want to upload hotel photos to the website. Log in to the platform, click on the upload photos button, upload three images, click the submit button, and tell me how it went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better task: &lt;/b&gt;You want to include a photo of a new suite on your StayHere page. Go to the platform and put the provided photo on your page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hint: You would provide the photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad task is way too prescriptive and gives too many clues. The better task gives less while still telling the user what they need to do and includes contextual information, such as providing the photo they will upload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example three:&lt;/b&gt; Plant Life, a fictional plant company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User goal: &lt;/b&gt;Sign-up to be a subscription member on Plant Life, specifically the Plant Parent tier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad task: &lt;/b&gt;Sign up to be a subscription member&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better task: &lt;/b&gt;You&amp;#39;re interested in Plant Life&amp;#39;s membership. Purchase the Plant Parent option. Then, use these test credit card details at the payment portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll let you work this one out, but as a hint, always think of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The context behind the task&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance between specificity and being too general&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necessary information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being action-oriented &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, if your study doesn&amp;#39;t require you to explain details and there&amp;#39;s low risk of confused participants, your study is probably a good candidate for unmoderated testing. Remember to conduct a dry run (or two!) before you send out the test to iron out any bugs or confusion!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience. Nikki run &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userresearchacademy.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;User Research Academy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a community and education platform designed to help people get into the field of user research, or learn more about how user research impacts their current role.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to measure the impact of your reports ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-measure-the-impact-of-your-reports</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-measure-the-impact-of-your-reports</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve designed an amazing report full of juicy evidence-backed findings, you can measure its impact and reach using insights’ features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact of your work can be important for several reasons. It allows you to improve your performance over time by measuring the relative success of each report.

This usually takes the form of a research report. Reports are a great way to summarize key findings from a research project, influence a product roadmap, build customer empathy, share customer insights across the organization, and—on a meta-level—they are an important way for researchers to evangelize the value of customer research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We think great reports are:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visually appealing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging, with lots of different media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaborative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked to supporting evidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full of actionable insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we&amp;#39;re going to show you how you can use insights to create stunning reports in Dovetail that capture all your important customer knowledge in an evidence-backed, actionable manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who this guide is for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide is suitable for anyone looking to share the output of their research with their teams or the wider organization.

Beyond reporting the latest findings from a research project, Dovetail users can build insights to report on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key customer personas&lt;/b&gt;. Link your personas to video highlights of real customers to help bring them to life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cross-project customer insights.&lt;/b&gt; You can pull insights from research conducted by other teams in your organization and use them to bolster your own findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Existing customer knowledge for onboarding new colleagues&lt;/b&gt;. Round up the latest and most important customer insights to get new team members up-to-date, eliminating the need to repeat the same research every time a new colleague joins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ongoing customer pain points about product features&lt;/b&gt;.

You can gather cross-project insights using insights and create reports that are more collaborative than your average report and flexible enough to cater to a wide variety of reporting styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re conducting research and looking to create engaging, well-sourced, collaborative reports that stakeholders will want to read, then follow these steps to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create an executive summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the text styling options from the block editor toolbar to create an executive summary to introduce the background of your research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Draw your readers in right at the start &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best reports provide the reader with something valuable right away, encouraging them to read on and dig deeper. What better way to capture the attention of your stakeholders than with a broad action-inspiring insight backed by Dovetail video highlights of users speaking about the subject at hand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add more insights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a title for each insight with the text editor tool. Use colored cards from the block editor toolbar to call attention to the relevant details of your insight. Back it all up by adding the project insight itself and select video highlights of users describing the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add quantitative data to your report&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charts, graphs, and tables can be downloaded from Dovetail and dropped into the insights block editor. Likewise, any images or data you have outside of Dovetail can be added the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep it fresh with different formatting options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one likes boring, one-dimensional reports. Try experimenting with your layout by adding or taking away columns and dragging and dropping block objects to curate your findings in several visually appealing ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provide quick context for further investigation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a custom search block to provide a research feed that updates every time someone loads the page and configure your search to include any relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the lightning icon, you can use predefined searches by selecting from templates we provide (such as ”projects you’re working” or “recently published insights”) or a custom search based on your own configurations using the gear icon. For example, if you’ve recorded specific values in your fields (like usability scores or role types) you can filter by those values and create a research feed full with cross-project data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where to find insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that anyone interested in finding relevant customer knowledge can uncover them with minimal guidance. To this end, we’ve introduced a “Recent” tab that allows all user roles to find insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights are also discoverable using global search, which can be filtered by insights, and through the “Explore” tab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create a research report in Dovetail today!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the information in this guide as a launch point. In no time, you&amp;#39;ll be creating awesome reports to share with the whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to analyze NPS responses]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-analyze-nps-responses</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-analyze-nps-responses</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Integrate your NPS survey software with Zapier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest and recommended way to import your NPS responses is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/connect-apps-to-dovetail-with-zapier/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt;. With a free Zapier account, you can connect apps together and move data around using automated workflows called &lt;b&gt;Zaps&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Creating a Zap for your NPS app&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by connecting your NPS survey software to Zapier. Once connected, you’ll need to create a new &lt;b&gt;Zap&lt;/b&gt;, and select the relevant &lt;b&gt;Trigger&lt;/b&gt; from your NPS app. Here are quick references to some of the more popular NPS apps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Delighted: &lt;/b&gt;use the &lt;b&gt;New Survey Response &lt;/b&gt;trigger to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wootric: &lt;/b&gt;use the &lt;b&gt;New Response &lt;/b&gt;trigger to. You also use the &lt;b&gt;Detractor Response &lt;/b&gt;or &lt;b&gt;Promoter Response &lt;/b&gt;triggers to filter more granularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AskNicely: &lt;/b&gt;use the &lt;b&gt;New Response &lt;/b&gt;trigger to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promoter.io: &lt;/b&gt;use the &lt;b&gt;NPS Score Changed &lt;/b&gt;trigger to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this example, we’ll look at creating a &lt;b&gt;Trigger&lt;/b&gt; using &lt;b&gt;Delighted&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve configured your &lt;b&gt;Trigger&lt;/b&gt;, you’ll need to set up the &lt;b&gt;Create Note Action&lt;/b&gt;. For this example, we want our notes to be created in a new project called &lt;b&gt;NPS responses&lt;/b&gt; within the &lt;b&gt;Uncategorised&lt;/b&gt; group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want the title of the note to be populated with the &lt;b&gt;Person Name&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt;Delighted&lt;/b&gt;. The content of the note will be the NPS survey &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/add-structured-data-with-fields/&quot;&gt;created fields&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;b&gt;Score&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Email&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Permalink&lt;/b&gt;, which we’ll populate with the respective values from &lt;b&gt;Delighted&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also set &lt;b&gt;Analyze sentiment&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;yes&lt;/b&gt;, which we’ll explore later in this guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve set up your Zap and &lt;b&gt;turned it on&lt;/b&gt;, any new responses from your NPS survey software will start creating new notes in Dovetail. If you’re looking to retrospectively analyze data you’ve already collected, you can use CSV import.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Option 2 - Import NPS responses from a spreadsheet (CSV)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a Zapier account, you can manually export your data from your NPS survey software and import it into Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of this over Zapier is that you will have to manually export and import to get the latest data into Dovetail, whereas Zapier will continuously push your data into Dovetail as it is collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Export data as a CSV from your NPS survey software&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to export your data from some of the most popular NPS survey software:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.delighted.com/article/91-can-i-get-my-data-out-of-delighted&quot;&gt;Delighted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://help.wootric.com/en/articles/979565-how-do-i-export-my-raw-wootric-data&quot;&gt;Wootric&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.asknice.ly/en/articles/2319523-how-to-download-your-surveys-sent-history&quot;&gt;AskNicely&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.promoter.io/docs/exporting-survey-data&quot;&gt;Promoter.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Import your data into Dovetail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve exported your data, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/take-notes-and-upload-data/#import-a-csv-spreadsheet&quot;&gt;import your exported CSV file into Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; to create new notes for each survey response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using sentiment analysis to automatically categorize your NPS responses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re setting up your Zap, or manually importing from CSV, you can enable &lt;b&gt;Sentiment analysis&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each NPS survey response, Dovetail will add &lt;b&gt;Positive&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Negative&lt;/b&gt; tags to sentences in notes that express a strong positive or negative sentiment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/help/highlight-and-tag-project-content/#sentiment-analysis&quot;&gt;Learn more about sentiment analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Quickly get a picture of the number of positive or negative comments in your NPS responses by showing sentiment tags in &lt;b&gt;Charts&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Structuring your project in Dovetail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve set up Zapier and have your responses flowing into Dovetail, or you’ve imported your NPS responses manually. Now it’s time to do some analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first group in our project is &lt;b&gt;Uncategorised&lt;/b&gt;. This is the group where all of our responses will be created in from Zapier. Because they’re in this group, we know that they need to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also created groups for &lt;b&gt;Detractors&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Passives,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Promoters&lt;/b&gt;. Once a note has been analyzed, we’ll move it into a group based on the score given on the survey. We’re choosing to group by the score here, but you can explore grouping by a taxonomy that’s more relevant to you, like customer segment, product, or user type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze a note, open it up and add any relevant tags. In this example we’re going to tag part of this comment with &lt;b&gt;Performance / Scale&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s sentiment analysis has automatically tagged parts of the comment as &lt;b&gt;Positive&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Negative&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/tag-across-projects-with-workspace-tags/&quot;&gt;workspace fields and tags&lt;/a&gt; to your NPS project, allowing you to select tags from across projects. For example, you might have workspace tags set up for features in your product. You could connect it to your NPS project and tag mentions of features in NPS survey responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quantifying NPS themes with charts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve analyzed your NPS responses, use &lt;b&gt;Charts&lt;/b&gt; to quantify how frequently problems or product areas are mentioned by your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charts are great for getting a quick view of the themes, features and areas that are responsible for affecting your NPS score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Publishing monthly or quarterly insights from NPS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got your NPS analysis workflow nailed, you might want to consider summarizing the most prominent or recurring themes each month or quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish your findings from analysis with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/summarize-and-present-insights/&quot;&gt;insights feature&lt;/a&gt;, and share your lessons with all the stakeholders in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to do before building your research repository]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/what-to-do-before-building-your-research-repository</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/what-to-do-before-building-your-research-repository</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;How to pitch a research repository to your stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To empower your team to build context, you might consider socializing articles and blogs about research repositories ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) is a notable UX research and consulting firm founded by pioneers in the user experience field, Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman. We suggest circulating their seminal article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/research-repositories/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;research repositories for tracking UX research and growing your ResearchOps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also distribute &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this end-to-end article about how a research repository can solve your organization’s research problems on our blog&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The article covers organizations’ common issues and explores how an excellent research repository solves those problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Design Researcher at Liferay and Dovetail customer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/myriammansoizquierdo/&quot;&gt;Miriam Manso&lt;/a&gt;, wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://liferay.design/articles/2021/creating-a-research-repository-with-dovetail/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this article on creating a research repository with Dovetail&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s always beneficial to highlight how other organizations are doing things when trying to sell a concept&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks might want to know that other people are creating repositories to be swayed; they need social proof. For them, you might want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/10/building-a-ux-research-insights-repository/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;why we built a UX research insights repository by Gitlab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Center the problem for your organization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re trying to secure buy-in from your organization or leadership, you should center your pitch on the problem that a UX research repository would solve for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problem: &lt;/b&gt;We struggle to get team members and stakeholders up to speed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch:&lt;/b&gt; People don’t know what to look for because there’s no single place that houses our customer knowledge, and they’re scrambling for the signal in the noise, the needle in the haystack. Dovetail is a single, central place where all our research and customer information could live. All our reports, notes, recordings, files, and images are in one place that’s searchable and easily accessible. Any new team member can effortlessly tap into this single source of truth for our entire customer knowledge base and painlessly get up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top tip:&lt;/b&gt; Jump into Dovetail today and curate a “start here” project containing &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the essential information a new colleague should internalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problem: &lt;/b&gt;We find it hard to scale and standardize customer knowledge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch:&lt;/b&gt; Dovetail is approachable for anyone conducting, consuming, or engaging with our customer knowledge. While written reports and presentations have been our ‘go-to’ for sharing user research insights, they’re usually inaccessible to the broader organization unless we’ve got a standardized home. They’re often shared spontaneously over email and chat or lost in some drive somewhere. There isn’t a clear place for people to learn about our customers. Dovetail brings consistency and makes it easier to store, search, and leverage past research and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problem: &lt;/b&gt;Different teams are talking to customers, but those teams aren’t talking to each other... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch:&lt;/b&gt; Customer research is conducted in various ways across our organization, and different research processes, data analysis methodologies, tools, and formats for insights can cause silos. It’s normal for people to do customer research differently, analyze their data with various tools, and publish data, reports, and updates across multiple formats and products. So our customer knowledge repository has to be flexible enough to work for various data types, methodologies, and organizational structures, while also integrating with our other tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problem: &lt;/b&gt;We duplicate research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitch:&lt;/b&gt; When someone joins a team or project, they might ask the same questions or run similar research projects to those that have come before them. This isn’t ideal because the organizational cost of relearning is expensive. With Dovetail, we can “remix” previous research in real-time and leverage our cumulative customer knowledge to make informed product decisions. We can &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; ask questions or run research that builds on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top tip:&lt;/b&gt; Come with some examples of repeated research to bolster the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mapping out your current customer knowledge before building your research repository&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before considering the functionality and usability of your research repository, you should take stock of where you are on the journey to genuinely centralized and accessible customer knowledge. Almost all teams conduct user research, even if they don’t explicitly call it that. As the volume of user feedback has grown, managing that research data, gleaning actionable insights, and collaborating cross-functionally has become more complex. We want to help you and your team map the types and formats of customer knowledge that you might want to incorporate into your user research repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who to involve in this process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to include the teammates that’ll be contributing or consuming content in your workspace to get a holistic picture of your current customer knowledge landscape. We suggest collaborating with the following roles and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User or UX researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product managers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX design and product design teams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Level set on the goal with your team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to map out the sources of customer data with your team. You could do this by running a live workshop, an online workshop with a digital whiteboarding tool, or an asynchronous exercise. Let your team know that the goal is simply to map out our current customer knowledge before building our research repository. Instead of solving for a future ideal state, everyone should reflect on where things are currently at—to take stock, not opine on the value of including specific types of customer knowledge in your research repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Document the current data landscape&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your team to document the types of user research or customer knowledge they engage with weekly, monthly, or yearly. We’ve got a list of examples here to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prototype and usability tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospect calls or emails&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Win/loss interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support topics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research and focus groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HR feedback surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net promoter score surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-product feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research study notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User research reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video Interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support tickets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPS surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing sessions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App reviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short user stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-depth summaries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Identify the locations where you currently keep raw data and research findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and your team should review the customer knowledge types and identify the locations where this data is currently housed (to the best of their knowledge). We’ve got a list of examples here to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added bonus:&lt;/b&gt; Some of them are &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/integrations/&quot;&gt;integrations you can seamlessly connect to Dovetail today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail/integrations/jira-software&quot;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/integrations/&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/integrations/&quot;&gt;Zoom cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail/integrations/delighted&quot;&gt;Delighted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail/integrations/notion&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google docs/PDFs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports/slides&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel/spreadsheets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airtable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail/integrations/dropbox&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail/integrations/confluence-cloud&quot;&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deciding what data to include when building your repository&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After considering all the different forms of customer knowledge that you &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; incorporate into your repository, you’ll need to figure out the complexity of importing and transforming it into a format that makes sense for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of data you decide to centralize in your customer knowledge repository should help your team get closer to the customer and answer customer questions quickly. Ultimately, it should help you and your team make better decisions and empathize with customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your organization might have a lot of historical data collected, so it can seem like a mammoth task to import all your past data, but we’ve got some tips and tricks to simplify it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Start your research repository from scratch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s really worth it is ultimately up to each organization to decide how valuable that stuff is. Many of our customers draw a line in the sand and decide to start fresh. This is by far the most straightforward, cost-effective option; however, some researchers and organizations don’t feel comfortable excluding past research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add things to your research repository incrementally&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of existing customer data you have, particularly unstructured qualitative data, and you might opt for the gradual rollout. There are a couple of ways you could slice and dice your data, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By methodology. &lt;/b&gt;You might consider some methods useful on an ongoing basis but not others. For example, you might add your video interviews but not your past survey responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By project. &lt;/b&gt;You might not see all your past research projects as equally important. This could result in you importing data on a project-by-project basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By time. &lt;/b&gt;You might decide on a cut-off point for importing past research. For example, you might focus on just the past three, six, or twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add only research output to your research repository&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might decide that you only want to pull in the output of past customer research. This would mean importing past research findings and insights instead of raw research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When including the output, you might want to standardize your research outputs for findability, potentially including the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name and status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name, contact details, and the team of the person responsible for the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of tags or create a taxonomy to increase the likelihood of findability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unsure about where to start with your research repository&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those folks who aren’t sure about the best approach, you could begin by triaging your current customer knowledge sources into two clear buckets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have to have: &lt;/b&gt;This could include your recent finalized research reports, your JTBD frameworks, or your research insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good to have: &lt;/b&gt;This could include your older finalized research reports, your in-progress research projects, or research mapped to particular personas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d want to start importing everything in the have to have column into your repository and add the good to have on a project-by-project basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How will your research repository operate?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your approach, there are still some outstanding workflow questions you’ll want to answer before sending your research repository live. Including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What resources are you going to dedicate to this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will the repository owner be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone add content to your repository?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of content can be added?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a standardized format for data to be added?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the name of the repository?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the structure and hierarchy in which things are stored and documented?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What metadata should be submitted along with the resource?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be easier to set up templates from the get-go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there it is! Hopefully you’ve got this far and feel more than ready to make the big pitch for a research repository and move your org up a few rungs on the UX research maturity scale in the process. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Five ways we reinforce our product-led growth model at Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/five-ways-we-reinforce-our-product-led-growth-model</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/five-ways-we-reinforce-our-product-led-growth-model</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early days, companies had to build and maintain their own infrastructure and software literally came out of a physical box. More recently, software moved to the cloud, riding the wave of scalable, flexible infrastructure. This sent development costs plummeting and made building new software more efficient than ever. As software development changed, so too did the way software got into the hands of users. The approach a company takes to distribution is often referred to as a go-to-market (’GTM’) strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly a decade ago, a new GTM strategy emerged called &lt;a href=&quot;https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth/&quot;&gt;Product-Led Growth (’PLG’)&lt;/a&gt;. End users started to expect the same intuitive interface and delightful experience in the apps they use at work as those they use at home, which was labelled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/darianshirazi/2013/05/08/the-consumerization-of-enterprise-software/?sh=14e5da8b2549&quot;&gt;consumerization of enterprise software&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the best software companies recognized this market shift and put end users at the core of their business. Dropbox, Asana, Atlassian, Slack, Shopify, Twilio, Figma and Notion are all great examples of companies that focus on solving the needs of the end user with a delightful solution. These businesses largely distribute their products in a self-serve manner—the end user trying and buying a product with only their email address and the swipe of a credit card. These businesses also realized that if they were going to distribute their product to end users at scale, they couldn’t be dependent on humans to get every person over the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model lets customers—primarily end users to begin with—mature their relationship with a product at their own pace. Typically, the more value they get, the more they are willing to pay. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openviewpartners.com/blog/what-is-product-led-growth/&quot;&gt;The decision-making criteria of the end user is now based on personal productivity—will this product actually help me day-to-day?&lt;/a&gt; It’s imperative to both design and solve problems for the end user. Over time, as more and more end users adopt, engage with, and get value from a product, organizations drive standardization around the access, usage, and administration of that product. In reality this often results in a centralized decision to purchase, roll out, and manage the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This growth model of 1) starting with the end user, 2) allowing demand and usage to increase organically or virally to spread to multiple users, then teams, and then departments, and eventually 3) company-wide and centrally managed, is the basis of PLG. While the foundation underpinning product-led growth is well understood, we’ve also sought out unique ways that build upon those principles. Here are five ways we reinforce product-led growth at Dovetail:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embed product-led growth in our values&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create end user champions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build inherently viral features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deliver mind-blowing, fun experiences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drive efficiency across the board&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Embed product-led growth in our values&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/&quot;&gt;five company values&lt;/a&gt; codify how we work together and what we believe in. Many companies have values like these to reinforce culture. We use them to guide how we work, but we also leverage our values to reinforce the core of our business—our product-led growth model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our value “if we do it; we nail it” drives a focus on quality, especially on the experience that end users have when initially purchasing and then using Dovetail day-to-day. While most products that follow a PLG strategy can be bought on a credit card in a ‘self-service’ manner, we went the extra mile to ‘nail it’ and built &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/categories/purchasing-and-billing/&quot;&gt;a section on our help center&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to purchasing and billing to help people buy Dovetail without talking to a human (or their boss). “If we do it, we nail it” also emphasizes how first impressions matter and how we sweat the details, both of which help remind us to invest in an intuitive experience so that end users reach ‘aha!’ moments quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we “put the customer first”, we don’t just mean in customer support. Building a deep understanding of what problems end users are looking to solve is a critical component of a product-led strategy, and talking to customers is ingrained throughout our culture—from our product team conducting regular customer interviews through to our sales and customer success teams sharing feedback from sales demos and customer check-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In marketing, we try to be concise and straight to the point (instead of fluffy or vague). Not only does this respect our customer’s time, but it also often results in putting our product front-and-center. Sophisticated end users are the buyers in our product-led growth model, and they don’t want fluff. &lt;a href=&quot;https://review.firstround.com/the-5-phases-of-figmas-community-led-growth-from-stealth-to-enterprise&quot;&gt;Figma gets it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Authenticity is important with any audience, but I’ve found that especially designers tend to hate traditional SaaS marketing. They don’t want fluff,” says Butler. “We had to think about how we might speak to this audience in a different way, so they understood that we’re not just trying to sell them BS. We are building something that’s going to be useful to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, our value “open by default” is about much more than internal transparency. We aim to be part of the ‘Age of Connected Work’ by integrating with tools in end user workflows and allowing data portability where feasible. In-product, permissions are optimized for open access. Our pricing is always transparent (even on our Enterprise plan), which makes sales more efficient by removing price negotiation. We maintain a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/roadmap/&quot;&gt;public roadmap&lt;/a&gt; which builds end user confidence in the future of the product and publish a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/categories/security/&quot;&gt;security documentation online&lt;/a&gt; to help people in a self-service manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create end user champions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We distribute our software via a bottom-up, land and expand growth model. At the heart of this model is the assumption that we can market to, and build a product for, end users, not their managers. To achieve this, our teams are obsessive about understanding the problems our end users face, solving those problems, and always speaking their language. We don’t believe in pushy sales or bullshit marketing — we aim to develop meaningful relationships with our end users through content marketing, community, support, customer success, sales-assist, and of course, our product. The benefit of this approach is that these people build such a strong affinity towards our brand that they become internal champions for Dovetail. They advocate for their teammates and stakeholders to use Dovetail for more projects, more types of research, and ultimately drive the cultural change towards building a better understanding of their customers. Creating champions also means our sales motion focuses on assisting them through their company’s purchasing process rather than selling the product in the traditional sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model of frictionless customer acquisition and internal expansion has far less friction than a top down sales model, but it requires us to constantly deliver real value to earn customer’s trust. This trust is required for them to put their reputation on the line with their peers, managers, and stakeholders. Every minute saved during their analysis process, every meeting where they nail the presentation of their work, every Slack message sharing a new customer insight—all of these moments and interactions build over time to make our champions look good and increase the momentum of Dovetail’s usage in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A product that generates champions also facilitates connections between those champions in a meaningful way through our community. Our users are often experts in their craft and experts in using our product. They share many of the same challenges in their day-to-day work, shared experiences, and career goals. Bringing people together creates opportunities to share best practices about their craft and our product, and the space to form new relationships. All of that helps us extend the experience people have with Dovetail beyond the product itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Build inherently viral features&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, Dovetail drives productivity. You can do more research faster, analyze it more efficiently, and generate more insights. But we also believe that customer understanding should be at the core of every product decision and building in inherent virality and collaboration helps researchers be much more impactful. Ongoing usage of Dovetail should drive someone to come back more and more frequently, and engage others in research. After all, customer insights that nobody consumes are pointless. Building ‘inherent virality’ into the core feature set and user journey is key to making that a reality. For example, sharing research outputs should be seamless. Dovetail should integrate seamlessly with other tools so customer knowledge can be embedded in core workflows. It should be simple to trace a piece of customer knowledge to a design in Figma, a ticket in Jira or embed a video highlight in a Notion page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deliver mind-blowing, fun experiences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/our-new-company-purpose-improve-the-quality-of-every-thing/&quot;&gt;When we set out to build a company, our first long-term goal was to build a product that had an NPS of 100.&lt;/a&gt; That is to say, a product that delighted people so much that they couldn’t help but tell other people about it at a family barbecue, a friend’s wedding, or a colleague at work. Shipping mind-blowing (and fun!) features helps us work towards this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This principle shows up in functional features like automatic transcription or video anonymization that fundamentally changes how our users go about their work forever, as well as non-functional experiences in the product like cute illustrations or lighthearted product copy. We take inspiration from consumer products and disagree that B2B software has to be boring and “enterprise-y”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind-blowing features are related to a core belief we have—software should be simple. Easy things should be effortless, and hard things should be possible. When we do both, people are excited to invite colleagues to share the experience. Their colleagues experience the value quickly and seamlessly and become equally excited to share with their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pull this off requires all of us to work closely together to consider the customer experience in its entirety, end-to-end. The best experiences happen when engineering, design, marketing, sales, customer success, and support come together. We measure it as much through someone being blown away by a magic moment in the product as we do through feedback from a Dovetail champion thanking our sales team for helping them purchase Dovetail efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drive efficiency across the board&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re always asking how we can achieve more with less time and energy. We solve problems at their root, avoid solutions that solve one problem but introduce two more, and seek to eliminate entire classes of problems where possible. Often that means engineering effort, but efficiency isn’t limited to a particular discipline. It applies across product, design, sales, support, operations—every part of the business can solve problems at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in support, we strive to have “zero non-unique questions” from customers. This means when we hear something more than once, we go back to the product and make the experience more intuitive or help the next customer find the answer themselves through our Help Center. Our sales process is set up to enable customers to self-serve as many parts of the journey as they can themselves—e.g &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/categories/security/#compliance&quot;&gt;publicly available security documentation and certifications&lt;/a&gt; over bespoke security questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our end user will always be at the heart of everything we do, every decision we make. We’re just getting started on our mission to help our customers &lt;i&gt;improve the quality of every thing&lt;/i&gt;, and we believe that a product-led approach is the one that puts the customer first.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quantify the impact of research with analytics]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/quantify-the-impact-of-research-with-analytics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/quantify-the-impact-of-research-with-analytics</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Effective user research can have a huge impact on organizations. For product teams, research informs prioritization and decision-making in the development process, nailing down tight definitions of customer problems, and increasing empathy for users. For the broader organization, research can support critical business decisions feeding directly into pricing, positioning, customer retention, and growth. The fragmentation of tools makes it impossible to quantify UXR’s impact on the organization, making it challenging to answer simple questions around consumption, engagement, and the impact of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that researchers should better understand their role in driving decisions that lead to improvements for their customers through clear metrics. Today, we are pleased to introduce two new features: insight metrics and workspace analytics. These two features help researchers demonstrate the tangible impact of research and understand what is resonating with their key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform analytics&lt;/b&gt; helps research leaders track their team’s output over time and understand ongoing research velocity in a way that the rest of the business can easily understand. You can access workspace analytics from your settings and apply filters to zoom in on particular types of research outputs or time frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insight metrics&lt;/b&gt; provide researchers visibility into who is engaging with their insights. Alongside everyday engagement tracking, you can now establish a continuous learning loop between you and your stakeholders in an effort to improve the quality of your research outputs. Click the metrics button to break down your total reach by channel and job role, and view granular engagement metrics to see which part of your research is resonating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform analytics and insight metrics are available in Dovetail now. Jump in and demonstrate your research impact today.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Give stakeholders what they want: more charts]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/filter-your-charts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/filter-your-charts</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Impressing stakeholders just got that much easier with the ability to&lt;b&gt; filter charts in Dovetail&lt;/b&gt;.

This was indeed a good sign we were getting buy-in from stakeholders. But it presented a new challenge: how do I prioritize these projects properly? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritization often gets associated with time management, but the reality is more complex. When your research backlog is large and resources are limited, you won’t get to everything. So prioritization goes deeper than &lt;i&gt;what should I work on first?&lt;/i&gt; I realized I needed a system to prioritize what we worked on and when. Here is what I came up with and why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step one: Hold a stakeholder meeting before prioritizing &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, a research project proposal is a vague idea first presented to me informally—sometimes via Slack or the last five minutes of a Zoom meeting. Initially, I’d try to get the gist informally, add it to our backlog, and prioritize based on what I’d heard. Once prioritized, I figured I would get into the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After doing that a few times, I realized I was essentially choosing what to work on with partial information. My usual flow for pre-project stakeholder meetings is designed to get to the bottom of goals, feasibility, and potential impact. If I don’t go through the full conversation, I’m not getting enough detail to choose if and when to work on a project or research topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the missing information is inconsequential, but I’ve had a few instances where the nature of a project completely changed. For example, once I decided that a project would be next up based on a Slack conversation. It was aligned with current business objectives, and the questions asked were important to decision-making and potentially impactful on the product roadmap. I adjusted the timelines of other projects accordingly, but when I went through the nuts and bolts with the stakeholder, I found that: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data needed to create relevant user clusters for us to sample from wasn’t in order, and I was going to need to work with our analysts for a substantial period before we even started interviewing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was a considerable disagreement between the stakeholder I spoke to and his manager, who would ultimately be making the relevant decisions about what population the research should focus on. This impacted the research plan and needed to be worked out and resolved before we began&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a fast-paced startup environment, there is always pressure to get moving. Still, I’ve found that agreeing to start on a project over other requests before the full pre-research conversation is almost always a waste of time. My rule of thumb is that every potential research project or request has an official first stakeholder meeting, and I never prioritize a project without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Make it numerical&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve defined the core elements of prioritizing research projects at Lightricks as:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;alignment with company priorities, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;potential impact on key decision-making, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;feasibility of UXR to answer questions, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;urgency versus a reasonable research timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your list may be the same or different depending on your organization, but it’s important to have that list.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I looked for red flags around these elements and made a judgment call, but I caught myself making calls for the wrong reason. For example, since I wasn’t rating a given project with each of those core elements, I was heavily influenced by things like how easy it was to work with a particular stakeholder or even political considerations. Just like it’s important to remove bias in research, there was a certain amount of bias that could be mitigated when choosing my team’s priorities.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, where I landed was rating each of the core elements on a scale from one to five (and sometimes, I’ll give one aspect more weight than the others by increasing the scale to one to ten, for example). Then I add up the numbers and take the highest scoring projects as my top contenders for &lt;i&gt;next up&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing it this way helps me remove my personal preferences from the process as much as possible. Sometimes something unexpected comes up, like a directive from my manager that influences what we choose to work on and in what order. Regardless, I find that using a numerical method puts me on the right track before other factors come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt;: Don’t let shorter projects (say a straightforward usability test, for example) hold up more in-depth research. Often, you can work on them in parallel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Don’t be afraid to pivot prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one loves to talk about this, but here’s the truth: we all choose incorrectly from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can happen for many reasons, some within our control and others less. For example, we’ve all had projects where saturation was difficult, and we had to reconfigure our methods or add more research subjects. In that case, it’s often worth pausing a project for a short period to kick off another in parallel or get a straightforward usability test done while you wait. Other times a stakeholder’s timeline changes due to management decisions, and they can’t wait for our insights and recommendations to make decisions. In that case, it’s important to regroup and understand whether it makes sense to continue at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you handle a change in organizational circumstances or necessary pivots in the research process will be situational. The important takeaway is that your initial prioritization can and will change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t be afraid to pivot as you go and always assume project prioritization will be iterative in a fast-paced organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right projects to work on and when is more than a time management issue. &lt;i&gt;When&lt;/i&gt; you deliver insights and recommendations can affect your overall impact, and if you want to have a seat at the table when it comes to key decision-making, timing is everything. In my experience, investing time in going over details with a stakeholder and taking a numerical approach to initial prioritization helps you create a research roadmap with sufficient detail and without your own biases. Your roadmap will always be iterative but starting strong based on your priorities positions you for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Cori Widen.&lt;/b&gt;

To quote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/humphreybc/?originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;Benjamin Humphrey&lt;/a&gt;, our Co-Founder and CEO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through the power of customer research, we go further than just enabling customer understanding. We help our customers create better products for people to use; better experiences for people to engage with; and better services for people to rely on. Customer understanding is simply a means to an end—the end is &lt;b&gt;creating better things.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We currently have three products in the market that are designed to solve specific challenges in the customer understanding space. However, we are only scratching the surface… We know there are many, exciting and challenging opportunities surrounding customer knowledge yet to be solved - so you can expect to see our products evolve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our open source approach to building new products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;📡 Our goal is to &lt;b&gt;quickly&lt;/b&gt; understand an opportunity and &lt;b&gt;start executing&lt;/b&gt; on an MVP.
We have a few, simple philosophies that help us achieve this goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Startup within a startup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on the customer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragmatism wherever possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tangible &amp;gt; conceptual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These philosophies help us identify where we can create the most value, enable informed decisions and ensure we learn quickly and fail fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Startup within a startup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about working at an early-stage startup is the opportunity to shape the company. This means that each product team member needs to be able to take off their product/design/engineering hats and put on their founder caps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are empowered to continuously ask ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this the most valuable way to spend our time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will this create the most value for our customers and for Dovetail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we achieve product-market fit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions effectively every team member has developed a deep understanding of our customers’ needs, the total addressable market, competitors, and available technologies. These questions enable us to stay focused on our mission and iterate towards building something valuable (or decide to kill the product).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also adopt the below frameworks and ways of working to help us to be successful:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assumption tracker. &lt;/b&gt;The team holds ourselves accountable for what is known vs what is assumed. We are continuously prioritizing and testing assumptions, so we can make informed decisions about where we should spend our time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understand the market &amp;amp; opportunity. &lt;/b&gt;We know the standouts and are clear on how we will compete&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go/no go decision points. &lt;/b&gt;We don’t fall into the trap of sunk costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick decisions.&lt;/b&gt; We hold each other accountable for not allowing bloat in decision-making&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on the customer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know who our target customers are. We seek to deeply understand them. We feel their pain and &lt;b&gt;are in love with their problems, rather than our ideas or solutions&lt;/b&gt;. We talk to our customers continuously and ask questions exploring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are their greatest challenges? How are they currently solving their needs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What tools are they using, and what do they like/dislike about these tools?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are their manual workarounds and how much time do they take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they had a magic wand, what would they do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product my team is exploring is solving for the needs of customers adjacent to our current customer base. We get creative about how to connect with these customers, including; interviewing our investor portfolio peers; reaching out to team members’ networks; and speaking with new roles within our existing customer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to connecting with our target customers to conduct research, we treat every conversation as an opportunity to test our GTM strategy and pitch. We make sure we’re continuously improving how we position the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pragmatism wherever possible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interest of moving quickly, we have consciously focused on not getting lost in the big picture. We ensure pragmatism by not wasting time with stand-ups and retros, and instead prioritizing continuous conversation. We’ve eliminated the need to manage an over-groomed backlog and instead we start each week fresh. Every Monday, we make a commitment to each other on the value we plan to ship that week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions we ask ourselves to encourage pragmatism:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we need to solve this right now? Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we descope? Could we do this more scrappily?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember&lt;/b&gt; that almost all decisions can be undone and that quick validation is more important than perfect data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tangible &amp;gt; conceptual&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Make It” is Dovetail’s quarterly hackathon, where everyone at Dovetail stops what they’re doing for 36hrs to build something they’re passionate about. But this isn’t the only time we Make It… making it is a part of our DNA! It’s how we explore new products and bring them to life. My team has prioritized ensuring that we always have &lt;i&gt;at least one tangible product &lt;/i&gt;artifact that is a source of truth and we can put into the hands of our customers. Our artifacts are our landing page, and a working, experimental iteration of our product. We prioritized these artifacts as they enable us to learn as much as we can, as fast as we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We intentionally keep our experiments scrappy, as we know we aren’t going to get them “right”. By taking this approach we are able to quickly test our hypothesis, compound our learning and spin up a new experiment super fast; meaning we are in an even better, more informed position when deciding what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many artifacts you can choose from. We considered all of the below before landing on ours:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product landing pages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A public roadmap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer journey maps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wireframes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clickable prototypes, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working iteration of your product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing is choosing the artifacts that will help you to &lt;b&gt;best understand your customers and compound your learning&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in joining Dovetail’s product design team?

It’s amazing to be placed in the top ten Small Category Best Workplaces™️ List Australia 2022!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s Great Place to Work award recognizes organizations that excel by having a genuine commitment to their workplace culture, company purpose, values, and more. Some deciding elements include wellness and flexibility, with special attention to employee mental, emotional, and physiological health. This list stretches across every industry across Australia, categorizing workplaces into three groups: Small, medium, and large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best-of-the best [list] also set the standard of sincere dedication to diversity and inclusion which has seen an emphasis on building belonging in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Place to Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this unique recognition has us blushing with pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our journey began last year when we were officially certified by Great Place to Work, and it’s an absolute honor to have them recognize us this year as the seventh best place to work in Australia for small businesses, across all industries. While we’re incredibly proud to have a place on this list, we have no plans on slowing down! We work hard to maintain an amazing work culture and as a fast-growing start-up, this is something we’re committed to prioritizing as we continue to grow, at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you might be asking yourself, what makes Dovetail so great, anyway? There are so many things we believe set us apart from the pack, but take a look at some highlights below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We’re values driven&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be clichéd to say, but we really do live &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/&quot;&gt;our values&lt;/a&gt; every day, in everything we do. We’re on a collective mission to improve the quality of every thing—these are the values that are getting us there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make our values tangible every Friday, where we get together to recognize the everyday achievements of our co-workers. By throwing the floor open to everyone in the organization, we provide the opportunity for our team to give shout-outs to individuals who exemplify one or more of our values. We also use this time together to casually demo what we’ve been working on throughout the week talking through our processes. We’ve found this ritual to be a great way to recognize the amazing things our teams are doing while keeping our values top of mind throughout every accomplishment, big or small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our weird and wonderful culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of our values, there are a few other things we think set us apart as an amazing place to work. First, Dovetail practices an office-first culture that encourages employees to come into the office and collaborate in person. Our founders, Benjamin Humphrey and Bradley Ayers, strongly believe shared office space facilitates stronger relationships through spontaneous interactions, which builds camaraderie among team members. That being said, we’re not an office-only company— flexibility is encouraged so everyone has the freedom to work the way that suits them best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail also hosts monthly social events and annual retreats, giving employees the opportunity to build trusting relationships (and have a little fun) organically. KitKat days are another unique perk that we believe sets us apart. These company-wide “days” are ad-hoc paid days off throughout the year for everyone to take a break and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from these perks, Dovetail is also a proud participant in Project F’s Program 50/50 diversity and inclusion initiative. This helps us identify and surface underlying systemic and environmental issues that are known to derail women in careers in technology. We also provide equal parental leave to support new parents at 20 weeks, practice an unbiased interview process, and take pride in our inclusive leadership across our offices in Sydney and San Francisco. We also have different well-being initiatives like access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://uprise.co/&quot;&gt;Uprise&lt;/a&gt; (an EAP) along with volunteer days given throughout the year, where our teams have the chance to give back to our communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail also hosts a quarterly “Make It” hackathon, which is one of our ways to spark innovation. This 36-hour hackathon gives everyone in the company a chance to step away from their day-to-day jobs to work on anything they like and team up with people from different functions to build something new. “Make It” ends with a presentation where teams pitch what they’ve built at the end of this fun and friendly competition. The top teams receive exciting prizes (and bragging rights). Some of Dovetail’s past projects include new features, new technology, addressing customer feedback, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We have big plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’re super proud of what we’ve achieved so far, this is only the beginning! We have big plans and move pretty quickly, having gone global by opening our San Francisco office and launching three new Dovetail products earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we continue to grow and evolve, we know that it’s the people that make it all happen. We know that it’s our product-led organization, values, culture, and unique processes that help to set us apart. The company currently sits at 80-plus employees, and Benjamin and Bradley still aim to meet with each new Dovetail hire during the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hop on board&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of growth, Dovetail is hiring!

You spoke to a group of people and created insights based on the patterns your interviews displayed. I had heard about correlational, experimental research, and a few other types, but I didn’t think they were relevant to user research. So for a long time, I operated within this sphere until I questioned my research practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in a senior role and looking to move into management when I started to take stock of my research practice. The company I had joined had more rigorous expectations of researchers, with a strong theme of academia. This experience was different from my standard team-of-one scrappy start-up user research. So, I analyzed my past experiences to understand better and hone my practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was reunited with all the different types of research out there and the various applications. So often, as researchers, we can get stuck in a methodology rut, always coming back to usability testing and 1x1 interviews. Now, there is a reason why those methods are so popular; they work and apply to solving many different types of problems. But, when we look a little closer, we can be more creative and thoughtful of all the different approaches available to us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Different types of research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When auditing my current practice, I started right at the beginning by looking at my process behind research questions. I have struggled a lot with formulating and creating viable research questions in the past. As a curious person, I want to learn about everything. I also am a people-pleaser, so I want to be able to answer my stakeholders’ needs and questions. However, this isn’t necessarily a great formula for conducting the best studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was comfortable choosing methodologies and recruitment (I had made plenty of mistakes I had learned from by then), the beginning of each study was most stressful. I often procrastinated and went around in circles with a stakeholder request I was uncertain about. It was getting to be a real problem for me, so I decided to go back to the basics and relearn the different types of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the fundamental dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative research, and I got very comfortable with delineating between the two. When stakeholders asked me about behavior or large-scale trends, I knew I was looking at a quantitative study. But when they approached me with the “how” or “why” questions, I learned to think qualitative (or mixed methods) immediately. However, when it came down to a qualitative study, I struggled even though generative research is my favorite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to go a step further in understanding the different types of research. In general, there are five types of research design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Correlational research design&lt;/b&gt; requires two different groups as the researcher is trying to establish a relationship between two closely connected variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Descriptive research design&lt;/b&gt; is when a researcher tries to explain the “how” and the “why” of research. They are interested in describing the reasons or insights behind a specific research problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diagnostic research design&lt;/b&gt; involves a researcher evaluating the underlying cause of a specific topic or phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quasi-experimental research design&lt;/b&gt; looks at a cause-and-effect of a situation where a researcher observes how one variable impacts another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explanatory research design&lt;/b&gt; uses a researcher’s ideas and thoughts on a subject to explore their theories further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do these types apply to user research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was obsessed once I had (a renewed) glimpse into research types. I wanted to deep dive into how these could apply to my work and, hopefully, make the stressful experience of beginning a study more manageable. In addition, I felt disconnected from my scientific and academic background, and this seemed like a great way to reincorporate these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I experimented with using some of these different research types in my studies and learned a lot from the experience. However, before we dive into examples of applying these types of research design to user research, I want to briefly touch on correlation and causation. These concepts were a nightmare for me to wrap my head around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Correlation&lt;/b&gt; means there is an association between two variables. When one variable changes, so does the other one. They covary, which means they change together, and if the two variables are correlated, you can predict that when one variable changes, so will the other. There are three types of correlation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive correlation: The variables change in the same direction, so when one variable increases, so does the other. A typical example of this is when height increases, weight increases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative correlation: The variables change in opposite directions, so when one variable decreases, the other increases. For example, when people see their friends more often, feelings of loneliness decrease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zero correlation: There is no relationship between the variables. For example, owning a cat has no impact on your height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Causation&lt;/b&gt; means that a change in one variable causes a change in another variable. So, one variable changing causes a change in another variable. An example of causation would be that more people get sunburnt as the weather gets hotter. So, the hotter, sunnier weather &lt;i&gt;caused&lt;/i&gt; an increase in sunburns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can often hear the phrase correlation does not mean causation, making these concepts even more confusing. Even if there is a correlation between two variables, we cannot conclude that one variable causes a change in the other. This relationship could be coincidental, or a third factor (confounding variable) may be causing both variables to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the example of causation above. The hotter, sunnier weather causes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People to get more sunburns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People to buy more ice cream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in air conditioners to rise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if we were to look at correlation, we can see a positive correlation with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more sunburnt people, the increase in ice cream sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in ice cream sales and an increase in air conditioner sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More sunburnt people and an increase in air conditioner sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, sunburns don’t &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt; people to buy more ice cream or air conditioners. So, while they are positively correlated, we can’t attribute causation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that’s out of the way, let’s see how we can apply this knowledge to user research. I won’t cover each type of research design as they aren’t all applicable to user research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Descriptive research design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptive research designs help provide answers to the questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptive research describes the situation of the research problem but does not answer “why” a problem is happening. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative, depending on which variables you are trying to answer. For example, when defining the “how,” you look at the process, so qualitative research can help you understand how someone is doing something. The who, what, when, and where can be understood at a small level with a qualitative study but would have to be followed up by quantitative research to generalize to a broader audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A customer journey map is an excellent example of a descriptive study as you look at all of these separate components. First, you begin with 1x1 interviews to understand the above questions, and then you survey a broader audience to generalize your findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Explanatory research design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exploratory design is conducted about a research problem when there is little past research. The focus is on gaining insights about unknown topics to make further recommendations. Explanatory research design answers the “how” and “why” questions. So, understanding why people act in a particular way or feel unsatisfied about an experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common explanatory research design method is 1x1 interviews, as they allow us to probe and ask these why questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Correlational research design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With correlational designs, you can get a clear picture of characteristics, trends, and relationships as they exist in the real world. However, you can’t conclude cause and effect (as discussed above). Nevertheless, correlational research is excellent for understanding large-scale behavior questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the longer somebody spends on a particular page, the more they spend at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are people uninstalling your app because of your weekly push notifications? Or is some other factor at play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you are using correlational design, consider correlation versus causation as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are many different ways we can design our user research studies, which can help us uncover new ways to approach problems and questions. When I dove further into research design, it invigorated me and helped me immensely when thinking through approaches, especially to more complex problems. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Five questions to improve your pre-project stakeholder meetings]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/improve-stakeholder-meetings</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/improve-stakeholder-meetings</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the outset of one of my first projects here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightricks.com/&quot;&gt;Lightricks&lt;/a&gt;, I remember asking questions about research goals, expectations, and potential impact. I had the opportunity to set expectations and make certain clarifications. Still, at some point, while knee-deep in a diary study analysis and halfway through a long set of interviews, I realized that my stakeholders and I weren’t truly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I salvaged that project and produced insights that stakeholders used, but it was needlessly stressful. In my postmortem, I traced the difficulties to that initial stakeholder meeting. I asked the prescribed questions and followed up with a written research plan. But I didn’t dig deeply enough. We each had an understanding that was too general. I’d failed to understand the nuances of what the stakeholder was trying to accomplish and &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, I learned that knowing something like: &lt;i&gt;“I suspect there is an issue with this flow, and I want to identify the top UX issues so that we can make iterations and improve the export rate”&lt;/i&gt; is just the beginning of understanding stakeholder needs. For example, maybe &lt;i&gt;the stakeholder’s&lt;/i&gt; manager is already married to a specific solution, and the goal isn’t as open-ended as it sounds. Or perhaps someone on their team has been advocating for a different solution based on their work, and no one is listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on my early experiences, I developed the following list of more nuanced questions to ask stakeholders in our initial meetings before we kick off a new project. I’ve found that these guiding questions make for a more detailed conversation that gives all of the necessary context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What problems are you trying to solve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing wrong with asking a stakeholder what their goal for the research is, I find that product people usually think about &lt;i&gt;problems to solve&lt;/i&gt; rather than overall goals. Research project goals are important, but problems give more context. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals: &lt;i&gt;I want to get some user insights to prioritize these two features for our Q3 roadmap.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problems: &lt;i&gt; I need to prioritize these two features for our roadmap, and there’s disagreement among our team. We tested an MVP of X feature, and some of the team think it failed because it didn’t meet a user need in general. Others believe we failed on execution. Also, the engineers aren’t optimistic about feature Y in terms of building it on a timeline that the VP of Product will align with. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the problem space from a stakeholder perspective provides a lot more information. It helps me understand the constraints we’ll operate under in terms of delivering insights that the team can use. For example, from that reply, I already know that it’ll probably be worth my time to speak with other relevant people on their team to understand the conflicting hypotheses more in-depth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly in startups, stakeholders operate at high speed with challenges related to users, teams, politics, and more. Though one definitely could have gotten all of these details by talking about goals, I find that asking about all the problems surrounding a research goal, instead of assuming they’ll come up in conversation, gives me a lot more necessary information from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the expectations of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; in terms of this feature or exploratory research? What is your manager asking of you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it doesn’t always feel super easy to ask a stakeholder what their manager is demanding of them, I’ve learned that it’s worth the 30 seconds of discomfort. Demands on a stakeholder are in the category I call &lt;i&gt;silent constraints&lt;/i&gt;. Almost anyone you work with on the Product team has a boss. That boss has an opinion, a complaint, or an unfaltering belief in something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example I got recently from a Product Manager: &lt;i&gt;[my boss] thinks the export rate should be significantly better if this feature really gives the user value. I’m under pressure to improve it by the end of the quarter while still keeping up with everything else we’ve planned to build and release.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that context, I understood that our research needs to deliver insights and recommendations that can be implemented quickly and easily, alongside other initiatives and likely with limited resources. If we deliver complex recommendations that require multiple quarters to plan and execute, that Product Manager won’t be answering the demands placed on him by his manager. In my experience, some stakeholders readily offer this type of context when asked about project goals—but many stakeholders need to be asked directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who on the team identifies with your hypotheses, and who sees it differently?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, I’ll meet with a VP of Product or a Product Manager, and I won’t even have to ask for &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; hypotheses about research outcomes. They’re usually eager to validate their assumptions and want to be doubly sure that the questions we’re asking give their hypotheses a chance to be proven right (though we all know that talking through what we’ll do if their hypotheses are invalidated is a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; part of initial alignment).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I ask about the hypotheses within a team, things get a lot more interesting. A PM is likely working with designers and engineers, for example. It’s unlikely all of their inclinations and beliefs are the same. I find asking for the varying hypotheses within a team helps me refine the research scope and craft a plan that addresses all of the outstanding questions to assist decision-making later on. Asking this question is essentially an acknowledgement that decision-making is complex within teams, and what you’re hearing from the main stakeholder may not always be the full story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional tip here: depending on how much the hypotheses vary within a team, you may want to consider meeting with some of the secondary stakeholders as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What deliverables will be most helpful for you and your team to work with?  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our team, we’ve found a groove that works for us when presenting research results: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/making-insights-actionable/&quot;&gt;we present the results to the main stakeholders&lt;/a&gt; in a meeting and then send out the slides to all relevant stakeholders at the company. When relevant, the slides include insights, recommendations, and some raw data, such as interview clips or dashboards. Overall, we received positive feedback on this approach both directly and indirectly.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as I got to know the various stakeholders and different teams at Lightricks, I realized that even with our standard format, some teams are more likely to absorb what we give them or utilize our recommendations &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/share-insights-stick/&quot;&gt;if we provide additional deliverables&lt;/a&gt;. For example, one team prefers to have its designers review the raw qualitative data and then, in addition to our usual stakeholder presentation, schedule a group discussion where everyone has a chance to voice their observations and talk through all of the relevant points together.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve also heard from a fellow researcher at another company that her team strongly prefers to get video summaries of research results rather than hosting a meeting. They like to watch and absorb the information at their own pace and then come together for a discussion afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily, this is a matter of finding a routine but also being willing to add additional practices based on how stakeholders work and their preferences. After working with different stakeholders for a year, I don’t always have to explicitly &lt;i&gt;ask&lt;/i&gt; this question because I’ve gotten to know the teams. But at the outset, inquiring about deliverables at the beginning of a project helped us give deliverables that had maximum impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;By what date will these insights be too late for you to use in your decision-making process? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most stakeholders value speed and efficiency and generally want the results as soon as possible. I found myself frustrated at the beginning of my journey as a researcher because everyone “needed” results by next week. I feared I’d sacrifice quality with speed, which made planning a research roadmap difficult and put me in a situation where I couldn’t plan more than a couple of weeks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned that tweaking the question about the timeline created a more workable situation, allowing me time to do great research and planning in advance. Instead of asking, “What’s your timeline?” or “when do you need results?” I ask stakeholders for the date by which these insights will be too late to use in their decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking this way helps initiate a conversation in which stakeholders think through the timeline instead of the go-to &lt;i&gt;ASAP.&lt;/i&gt; Recently, a stakeholder told me they had an urgent project and wanted to know if we could get preliminary results by the end of the following week. After asking &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; amended question, the stakeholder realized that actually, they wouldn’t need the insights for decision-making until a month from now when they’re finalizing a certain aspect of their roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their initial urgency came from feeling stressed about the upcoming process rather than a pressing need for insights next week. Now, we’ll be able to deliver quality insights by doing thorough research and not trampling over other projects that are in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is a lot of variation between stakeholders. Still, a big and important lesson I’ve learned is to constantly evaluate the effectiveness of my initial meetings with stakeholders. Though these meetings become routine for the average researcher, I always find small tweaks to the process that can increase our chances for success and impact later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Cori Widen, User Research Team Lead, Lightricks. &lt;/b&gt;Cori leads the UX Research team at Lightricks.  She had worked in the tech industry for 10 years in various product marketing roles before honing in on her passion for understanding the user and transitioning to research. Outside work, Cori is busy reading books of all kinds, hanging out with her husband and two kids, and traveling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Six-step framework for a high-performing product strategy]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/six-step-framework-product-strategy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/six-step-framework-product-strategy</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You’ve got a great idea for a new product.

You need a product strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is product strategy?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product strategy is a high-level plan for developing a new product. It defines what you want to achieve and how you’ll get there. Think of it as the big picture that encompasses the vision and goals of product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There are four major elements of product strategy:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identify your customers. &lt;/b&gt;Who will buy your product? What’s your target market? What need are you trying to meet? Learning about your potential customers, interviewing them, and creating personas will help you tailor your product to your target audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understand your competition. &lt;/b&gt;Knowing your competitor’s strengths and weaknesses can help you determine how to make your product stand out. Where will your product fit in the market? Will you produce something similar but better to what’s already available, or will you do something different&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making a profit&lt;/b&gt;. How will the product make money and provide a return on investment to satisfy stakeholders? How will customers buy the product? What’s the product lifecycle? Will there be a one-off payment or a subscription?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macro environment. &lt;/b&gt;Factors outside your business, such as politics, economics, culture, technology, and social influences, may affect your customers’ buying habits. Consider how you’ll mitigate these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why product strategy is important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a clear plan for product development, it’s easy to get lost in the details, forget the purpose of the product, and go off on a tangent and start developing a product that isn’t what your potential customers want or need. A product strategy keeps you focused and moving in the right direction. It provides clarity for the whole team so they can work together towards a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product strategy vs. product roadmap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product strategy and roadmap are sometimes thought of as the same thing, but they’re different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A product strategy is a high-level product development plan. It answers the “why” you’re developing this product. A product roadmap answers the “how.” It’s the guideline on how to execute the product strategy. It steps out the product development process and provides a timeline on how to bring together a successful product. The roadmap sets and communicates priorities, keeping product managers, product teams, and stakeholders on the same path, working towards the same vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A product strategy framework in six steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to create a successful product strategy? Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Create a product vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A product vision is the essence of the product and identifies its long-term goal. It answers the “why” you’re developing the product, sets the strategy, and aligns the product team. Understanding the reason for the product and the goal you’re trying to achieve can keep the team focused when you hit roadblocks or start straying from the original path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of the motivation behind the product to find the vision. Say you’ve got an idea for an app that shows walking trails close to where someone lives. The vision might be “help people exercise” or “help people get out and explore nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at a real-world example. Google is a search engine, but its vision is “to provide access to the world’s information in one click.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Understand the customer and the problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After establishing the “why,” you need to look at the “who.” Who will buy and use your product?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are some ways you can find out about your potential customers&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User research. Talk to people to help you understand the customer, their needs and motivations, and what problem you’re trying to solve for them. You can set up interviews, focus groups, or send out surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create personas. A persona is a fictional person who represents real people. They’re created from the data obtained during user research, and you can use personas to determine how some user groups, such as the busy parent, might use your product or service and what the pain points might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Job-to-be-done” (JTBD). Applying the JTBD approach to product development helps you discover the job the customer wants done and their motivation. The customer might buy a blender to do the job of making smoothies, but their motivation behind the purchase is to consume healthier food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User story mapping. This is a great way to understand user experience. Collecting many user stories can show you how customers interact with your product, which helps with prioritization. You’ll identify the minimum functionality needed for the initial release and what can be included as new features in updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Understand the market&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When buying your product, customers hold a lot of power. You might develop a great product, but customers will still do their research and compare your product with alternatives. Here’s how you can better understand the market:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering information about your target audience can give you an idea of how successful your product might be. Really understanding your potential customer’s needs, their pain points, the journey they’ll take with your product, the way they think and feel, and what’s important to them will help you know how to differentiate and optimize your product. The personas you created earlier will come in handy here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, look at how alternative products are performing, what’s trending, and if there are any anticipated changes in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competitive analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going too far with product development, it’s important to know what’s already available. Identifying and evaluating a competitor and their product and knowing its strengths and weaknesses can help you see opportunities for differentiation. What values and unique new features could you add to your product to draw interest away from the competition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product positioning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product positioning is how you present your product to the market and the messaging you’ll use to influence how potential customers perceive it. Look at the language competitors use, what problem they’re trying to solve, or what user need they’re trying to meet. Consider the user pain points and your product’s differentiation to address them. Then you can create messaging that resonates with people because it explains why your product is better than the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Identify success metrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself what you want to achieve with the product. What are your goals? Setting key performance indicators (KPIs) gives you data points you can measure to gauge your product’s success. You can also tie these metrics back to your business objectives when reporting to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider collecting metrics on:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;product usage or adoption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;customer retention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;quality (how many bugs or issues are reported)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;customer acquisition cost&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;monthly recurring revenue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These valuable insights can help you make better decisions about your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Build the product roadmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product roadmap is an important step. As a product manager, you get to take all the data and ideas you’ve collected and transform them into an actionable plan to set priorities and start the product team on a path to developing the product. A product roadmap isn’t static but evolves to match changes in customer needs and market demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The type of product roadmap you build will depend on the audience. Options include&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release roadmap for planning your product releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features roadmap to show the timeline for when features are delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategy roadmap to show high-level efforts and planned initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals roadmap to plan the achievement of objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whichever one you choose, make sure it’s suitable for the audience. Make it clear and appealing, and include just enough information not to overwhelm but keep everyone on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Execute, measure, iterate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to think about how to develop your product and get it out to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking an idea for a product through to delivery to market is a collaborative process involving cross-functional teams. That’s where your product roadmap will come in handy. It’ll ensure the product’s vision and development actions are communicated across different teams. Think about the best methodology to develop the product (it might be agile, scrum, or waterfall, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When your product is ready, consider how you’ll launch it. Think about&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;launch goals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;key messages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;marketing materials and what channels to use (e.g., social media, emails)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how newsworthy the product is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the product launch, you’ll use the success metrics you identified earlier. Feedback on product performance can help you identify issues to address in updates or with new features. This iteration process is a cycle that keeps the team testing and improving the product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Health is wealth: We’re HIPAA ready]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/health-is-wealth-were-hipaa-ready</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/health-is-wealth-were-hipaa-ready</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To our friends in the healthcare industry who worry about the protection of private health information (’PHI’), worry no longer—we’ve gone ahead and built a solution that helps you comply with HIPAA standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations from diverse industries look to Dovetail to power greater customer understanding and help them to put their customer’s voice at the heart of everything they do. And for many of these organizations, data security and privacy are non-negotiable when gathering and storing customer information. This is why we continuously pursue the highest technical standards, organizational measures, and industry-recognized accreditation to ensure our customers have trust and confidence in our products. With the announcement of our new HIPAA-ready solution, we hope to continue supporting healthcare customers to improve the patient and practitioner experience worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transforming the healthcare experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has resulted in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-changed-the-way-us-consumers-think-about-healthcare&quot;&gt;rapid digital transformation&lt;/a&gt; of the healthcare industry. Providers have adopted new tools and technologies to improve the patient experience, increase workflow efficiency, and better the efficacy of data management. Healthcare organizations gather large amounts of first-party data from patients and practitioners to understand how they feel about the virtual healthcare products and services they’re experiencing, an essential component in improving the quality of their digital experience. Many healthcare organizations have turned to third-party software providers, like Dovetail, to analyze and glean insights from this data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers and organizations must trust that their private health information (or that which they are accountable for) is being protected and their digital privacy respected. ‘HIPAA’ is one of the standards organizations rely on for guidance on what good looks like when securing both protected health information (’PHI’) and electronic protected health information (’ePHI’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is HIPAA?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the healthcare industry, you’ll likely be familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html&quot;&gt;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996&lt;/a&gt; (’HIPAA’), a United States federal law that establishes data privacy and security requirements for organizations accountable for safeguarding PHI. When it comes to HIPAA standards, technology providers must have security in mind when building tools, processes, and procedures. This includes having the appropriate technical and organizational safeguards governing their technologies and the business policies and procedures around their use. While there’s no formal certification for HIPAA compliance, complying with the standards set out in HIPAA is a shared responsibility between software providers and their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does HIPAA mean for Dovetail?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been building our products with a focus on security and data protection from day one. The knowledge that you entrust Dovetail with potentially sensitive and confidential research data about your customers is not something we take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is we recently decided to step it up to ensure healthcare customers have a Dovetail solution that helps them comply with HIPAA standards. How do we know, you ask? Well, we engaged an independent firm specializing in integrated risk management and information security to conduct a HIPAA Security Risk Assessment and Implementation Review of our operations and services. They confirmed that the manner in which we store and process healthcare data is not only in alignment with HIPAA’s compliance requirements, but in many cases exceed requirements. What’s more is that they found our security risk program to be above industry average. So all in all, you can rest easy knowing that your protected health information is in good hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s included in our new HIPAA offering?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new HIPAA solution aims to enable healthcare-focused organizations to store, process, and analyze customer data (such as patient or practitioner feedback that includes PHI) securely and compliantly. Our HIPAA solution provides access controls and features to help manage PHI, such as advanced restrictions on sharing, access, and data exporting. Some of the key features of our HIPAA solution include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;→ The ability for users to export CSV files is disabled by default&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;→ The ability for users to download video files is disabled by default&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;→ Public access to and sharing of insights is disabled by default&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;→ Enforced authentication via SSO with email and password authentication is disabled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;→ All sub-processors processing ePHI have entered into a BAA with Dovetail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;→ The ability for customers to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (’BAA’) with Dovetail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Dovetail HIPAA solution provides customers with greater access controls to help manage PHI, the responsibility of the workspace admin is to control who within their organization has access to the contents of the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our HIPAA solution is packaged as an optional add-on to our Enterprise plan, that customers can choose to purchase. Dovetail Enterprise customers who purchase the HIPAA add-on can enter into a BAA with us. To engage, review or sign a BAA with us, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/contact/form/?type=ENTERPRISE_SALES&quot;&gt;contact our Enterprise team&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where can I learn more about Dovetail’s HIPAA solution?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here at Dovetail, we’ve prioritized providing a HIPAA solution so that research and customer-facing teams in the healthcare sector can continue to store, analyze and collaborate on customer research, while ensuring that sensitive, valuable patient data remains uncompromised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about our HIPAA solution on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/enterprise&quot;&gt;Enterprise page&lt;/a&gt; or by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/contact/form/?type=ENTERPRISE_SALES&quot;&gt;contacting our team&lt;/a&gt; today.

It doesn’t matter if we’re fascinated by the results of a research project we crafted and conducted. We must ensure that somebody uses those insights. For example, our findings lead to a particular design decision. Or they assist a product team in scoping a new feature. Or they help us realize where we need research, so we can understand the problem before approaching a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Actionable insights” mean that your research findings can improve users’ experience in some way. There are&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-data-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt; many different ways&lt;/a&gt; to create and articulate them. The question remains—&lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; do we make insights actionable? Is there a magical formula that ensures stakeholders know what to do with the insights we produce?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not magic. But done correctly, it almost looks like it. The &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;, my fellow researchers, can best be understood in the context of a maneuver you might be familiar with from relay races: the baton handover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The research project as a relay race&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love watching relay races. It’s easy to admire the speed and grace of the athletes. But the moment I hold my breath is when the runner hands the baton to the next race participant. That handover happens in a flash and can make or break a team’s chance for success. The more they have prepared and communicated their handover strategy, the more likely they will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we view our research project as a relay race, the moment we hand our insights off to our stakeholders is synonymous with a baton handover. But success consists of more than just the handover. A successful race requires meticulous preparation leading up to that moment. It also needs a post-race retro, so the team improves its execution and learns from past mistakes. Let’s take some time to talk about each of these elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preparation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research project is like a relay race because it’s not just up to the researcher to run the distance to complete the race. It requires an insights handoff. In other words, it needs other participants to make it happen. Preparation is vital, and there are a few important questions to ask as you complete this step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;With whom are you running the race?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure out who your key stakeholders are before the research project kicks off. “With whom” goes beyond simply identifying who your stakeholders are. You need to identify their expectations and assess whether they’re reasonable. It requires you to know if they have a deadline for receiving the insights. You need clear communication around the handover—will you share broad themes? How Might We statements? Insight “&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/atomic-research/&quot;&gt;nuggets&lt;/a&gt;”? Do stakeholders want you to move into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-report-recommendations-examples/&quot;&gt;solution space&lt;/a&gt; after sharing your insights, and are you comfortable doing so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What are the rules and regulations of the race&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relay races require participants to follow strict procedures or face disqualification. Similarly, research project stakeholders need to know what is expected of them. More broadly, their role—and your role—should be communicated clearly before the project starts. For example, what role will your non-research stakeholders play regarding interaction with your research participants? If they participate in the interview process will they ask questions or observe? Are their observations taken into account when analyzing the data? What process do you follow if you disagree on the conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve done it—you’ve answered these questions. You’ve prepared, and it’s here—the race is on! It’s almost time to hand over the baton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The baton handover&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baton handover is all about precision. In a relay race, the receiver waits until she sees the passer enter the handoff zone and begins jogging forward to receive the baton, allowing her to continue the race already in motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The handoff zone is marked and strictly regulated, and a handoff that occurs outside the demarcated area results in disqualification. Similarly, you must be aware of any consequences for failing to hand off research insights at a given moment. Say our stakeholder has a strict deadline and must proceed with development or design by a specific date. Or there’s an important leadership meeting in a month. Before that meeting, we need to plan an insights debrief so our stakeholder can approach leadership with fresh knowledge from our project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a relay race, the handover occurs at a split-second moment. In an ideal situation, this happens as quickly and smoothly as possible. The aim is to get the second runner on her way with the baton firmly in hand. Our stakeholders would agree: knowing when and how they will receive our insights and what they can do with them will make all the difference to the success of our research project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Post-race retro&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take it back to the heart of the operation: our work within an organization should serve the overall aim to deliver delightful products or services to our users. If we perform a successful handoff to our stakeholders, they can do something actionable with our insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So: what happened? How did it go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re all familiar with the retro, but I’d encourage you to think explicitly about the handover moment when conducting a retro for your next research project. That means asking your stakeholders how they’ve incorporated your insights into their work. This could be a tough conversation, especially if they’re unsure or critical. But opening up this direct line of communication and iterating on our process is an excellent way to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be motivating to think about how athletes precisely set themselves up to run a successful relay race and what we can learn from them when planning for success in our user research projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started this article with a brief description of different kinds of actionable insights from both evaluative and generative research. There’s an additional benefit from ensuring our baton handover is smooth and well-communicated: Our research project, with its insights handover strategy iterated time and again, could lead to impactful changes within a team’s or even an entire organization’s mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, get out there and run that race!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Janelle Ward, Principal Consultant, Janelle Ward Insights. &lt;/b&gt;Janelle has led UX research at digital product companies, both as a founding lead and as a manager upskilling and growing existing research teams.

Scores of people are writing, speaking, and sharing regularly on topics of UXR best practice. That says something: our work is important to us. We want to find the most rigorous and compelling ways to share our insights with stakeholders, fellow researchers, and the rest of our organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this drive toward excellence through best practices does not always reflect the reality of our workplaces. Striving for cutting edge research practice is difficult if your organization doesn’t even understand the fundamentals of research. This is often the case in organizations with low “UX maturity.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are ways to approach these challenges in the workplace. Before getting to specific examples, some definitions are in order. What is a “low maturity” organization? UX maturity is a bit of a buzzword, so let’s break it down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The theory behind low UX maturity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Jakob Nielsen created one of the earliest UX Maturity Models, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-stages-1-4-original/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Corporate UX Maturity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Nielsen Norman has updated their model, naming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;six key stages&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the road to a UX utopia, ranging from “absent” to “user-driven.” The argument goes that organizations proceed fairly universally through these stages. We can consider a low maturity organization as one that falls within the first three stages, somewhere between “absent” and “emergent.” (Note: Nielsen Norman’s UX Maturity Model is focused on UX in general, but in this article, I’m talking specifically about research challenges.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great news is that if you’ve been hired as a researcher, there is at least some level of buy-in for the work you are doing. Given your presence and your presumably busy workload, we could potentially classify your organization as at least “emergent”. Nielsen Norman says the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-stage-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;emergent stage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is when “a company’s UX efforts…are functional and promising, but inconsistent and inefficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your organization is far from utilizing the full potential of research expertise. If you work in a company like this, you’re probably nodding your head right now. (If you’re not sure, or you’d rather not just follow your intuition, there are clear ways to assess UX maturity. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.nngroup.com/s3/Maturity-Quiz&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take a quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following the Nielsen Norman approach, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uxr-maturity/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take an approach we’ve outlined&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s specific to research efforts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crucial part of assessing UX maturity is understanding how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/factors-ux-maturity/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;four key factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contribute to its development: strategy, culture, process, and outcomes. All of these factors need to be addressed to move an organization’s maturity forward. For the examples that follow, I focus primarily on culture, or &lt;i&gt;a company’s knowledge about and attitudes toward UX&lt;/i&gt;. This is because culture shapes an organization’s approach and reaction to every piece of work you will do. It’s also often the most difficult to change, and the most ubiquitous to encounter in everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let’s take a look at some common scenarios that a UXR leader might encounter in an emergent UX maturity organization, particularly in relation to knowledge and attitudes toward research. We can break these examples down into key levels, namely, the organization level, the product team level, and the researcher level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing UX maturity at the organizational level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can often find inconsistent reception for their work at the organizational level. One product team might embrace research insights, while another dismisses them. Product and company leadership hasn’t bought into research enough to steer or encourage a product-wide research practice, which leaves researchers in a challenging spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to solve this problem: rather than wholly focusing on individual products or product teams, communicate that research can bring its best insights when focusing on user groups, which are often relevant to multiple product teams (and even the whole organization). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means potentially reexamining recent research projects and highlighting insights that are relevant for a user group rather than just a specific product. By sharing insights in this way, you can complement PM’s existing knowledge about their customers, and show them how your work can add to their existing insights, while simultaneously creating common ground across product teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Growing UX maturity at the product team level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re working closely with a specific product team, and the PM sees research as providing its best work in validating just-launched features. To them, research provides insight into how a feature is received by the user or customer, and this insight can help them decide if and how to iterate on this feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is indeed an offering that user researchers have in their vast toolbox. But your stakeholders are missing out if they see research contributing only to development and design validation. Sometimes insights shine the brightest and provide the most lasting impact when used in vision or strategy creation, and prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you stuck in a cycle of conducting usability tests, and feel discouraged that you’ll never get to dive into a strategic research project? Fear not! Usability tests can uncover insights into customer needs and behavior that you (and your stakeholders) weren’t expecting to see. Keep track of those bonus insights, and find an opportune time to share them. Don’t be afraid to suggest how they might be used to contribute to broader goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be that your stakeholder isn’t even aware, and your initiative could be the spark to change your work (and theirs!) for the better. Then, use this momentum to advocate for bringing research into the product development process earlier than the evaluation stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing UX maturity at the researcher level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low UX maturity may be an issue at the organization or product team level, but it can also be an issue internally on your UX research team. Some researchers may simply be used to working in a low-maturity organization and don’t want to or don’t know how to push their craft forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is arguably the most challenging aspect of growing maturity, as it stems from your own team. This is an issue that speaks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/the-challenges-of-inheriting-a-research-team/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;broader management challenges of inheriting research teams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lead with positivity—show them what’s possible. Include your existing team when you &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-grow-ux-research-team/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;create a vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and make sure to get everyone on board with your goals. Listen to your researchers and their challenges with key stakeholders. Coach them, and when necessary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/five-things-create-strong-research-culture/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;step in and show them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; how to cheerfully challenge assumptions about research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, whether you’re tackling culture shifts at the organizational, product, or research level, get yourself a seat at the decision-making table. Changing organizational culture is a challenge. Making sure that leaders see and internalize the contribution research makes is the fastest path to growing the maturity of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Janelle Ward, Principal Consultant, Janelle Ward Insights.&lt;/b&gt; Janelle has led UX research at digital product companies, both as a founding lead and as a manager upskilling and growing existing research teams.

By the time I was given the role and asked to build out UXR, Lightricks had already achieved unicorn status and had more than one internationally recognized brand in its product portfolio.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge as the first researcher at an already accomplished company is that not everyone is so sure that they &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; in an organization where they’ve already achieved considerable success &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. Not only that, but you’re also in a situation where there are already established product development practices, and you have to provide tangible value without teams feeling like you’re disrupting their flow.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of my journey, I knew that the conventional wisdom for new researchers was to seek quick wins that show the value of user research to key stakeholders, and that was my stated mission at the beginning. 

I soon learned, though, that&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;there are a lot of nuances to consider even as I moved forward at full steam, chasing my initial quick wins. Now I’m a year into my role. We’ve grown from one solo researcher preaching the gospel (yours truly) to a team of three that’s significantly more integrated into product development and has more backlog than it can handle. Here’s what I learned about quick wins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Align wins with current business goals &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; what people are excited about&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My manager, the VP of Product, gave me a good sense of what the key business goals were from the perspective of senior management, and I made sure that all of my proposed projects were aligned. One of the main KPIs involved exploring new ways for our target audience of visual content creators to grow their audience and monetize their content. These goals lent themselves well to generative research, and I designed a few different projects with varying methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main win in this first set of projects was that my insights and recommendations got a lot of internal visibility. I saw them incorporated into Product Requirements Documents, roadmap presentations, and other internal documentation showing how we were moving forward and why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, my initial success was because my research aligned with what people were &lt;i&gt;excited &lt;/i&gt;about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another small but notable win was that after distributing results from our initial projects, my calendar filled up pretty quickly with stakeholders all over the company wanting to know if user research could help them in their area of the business—curiosity was definitely piqued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you ask for current business goals, you often look at a set of north star metrics. But in my case, what set me up for initial success was that my findings were aligned with key metrics, and I was focused on an area of the business that everyone was buzzing about.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not always immediately intuitive how important KPIs translate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-write-discussion-guide/&quot;&gt;research questions&lt;/a&gt;. Meeting with stakeholders and asking the right questions is obviously the way forward, but I found it helpful to take a step back and ask &lt;i&gt;myself&lt;/i&gt;: what’s everyone excited about at the company right now? What assumptions are we making? What do we need to know to succeed in the current path? It’s more likely that your initial projects will get the visibility and impact potential you’re looking for if you answer questions related to key business metrics and research an area of the business that has a buzz around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your initial projects as focused as possible &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mistakenly assumed that the more information I delivered, the more impact I’d have. But I learned that quick wins are ultimately determined by impact, not the scope of the research. When you deliver &lt;i&gt;too many&lt;/i&gt; insights, you risk stakeholders using the insights and recommendations that are easiest to swallow while the rest gets forgotten.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if your initial research is largely generative and exploratory, remember that keeping the scope manageable makes it more likely that stakeholders will find your results interesting and actually use them. Though I’d argue that this is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; true, it’s especially important when looking for your initial quick wins as a new researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embrace long-term advocacy from the start&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I didn’t have trouble explaining my findings when asked, when I saw things in motion that contradicted or ignored research findings, I saw it as my own failure to communicate and vowed to do better next time. What I’ve learned over time is that the understanding and integration of research insights is a part of the ongoing product development process. Taking an approach where you present your findings and cross your fingers doesn’t lend itself to true impact unless you get lucky. The key is to see yourself and present yourself as a resource throughout the product lifecycle. What that means depends on the structure of your organization, but here are a few things that worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;End your presentation or other deliverables by letting key stakeholders know you’re available to help brainstorm next steps. &lt;/b&gt;Many times, especially when research is new, stakeholders don’t realize that you’re a great resource and brainstorming partner even after you deliver your findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check in with key stakeholders a week or two after presenting your findings. &lt;/b&gt;This is a good opportunity to get feedback on the utility of your work, but it’s also a great time to ask about the status of your &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-report-recommendations-examples/&quot;&gt;insights and recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Are they moving forward with anything that you recommended? Why or why not? Could you address any additional research questions to help them move forward with key initiatives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay on top of what’s going on in Product and ask questions. &lt;/b&gt;At Lightricks, I have access to roadmap presentations. When I saw something related to recent research results, I ensured that the relevant stakeholders had access to our findings and reminded them that I was available to discuss further. On more than one occasion, I’ve reignited interest in pursuing some of our team’s key recommendations by initiating these conversations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keep insights alive with a repository from the start&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I was settling into my new role, I’d read a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/products/playback&quot;&gt;research repositories&lt;/a&gt;. Still, my initial assumption was that it was premature to invest time in this type of documentation when I was a solo researcher who hadn’t exactly done an abundance of research yet. However, I noticed that the initial splash made by my first set of research projects was relatively short-lived, and stakeholders forgot about my previous findings whenever I released new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was creating&lt;i&gt; research moments&lt;/i&gt; rather than a living, breathing body of knowledge that could guide stakeholders as the company catapulted forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I’d hired another researcher, I prioritized creating an organizational memory of insights and data with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; as our primary tool. We’re still iterating on our repository approach, but we’re reaping some benefits even at the outset of our journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/products/markup&quot;&gt;Tagging raw research data&lt;/a&gt;, such as interview recordings and project insights, with relevant nomenclature gives us an easy way to refer stakeholders to cross-project information when they’re working on something specific. This helps avoid situations where the product team only works with the most recent data and insights simply because that’s what’s top of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation to all new researchers, solo or with a team, is to start documenting your work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/share-insights-stick/&quot;&gt;sharing insights&lt;/a&gt;, and developing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-we-learned-creating-tagging-taxonomy/&quot;&gt;initial taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; from the start. It’ll help you create a practice whereby your research findings build an organizational narrative among stakeholders rather than dying out a week after you send out your deliverables. Building your repository will inevitably be an iterative process, but starting from the beginning and getting that process in motion was a really important step for our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, keeping all these lessons in mind, I’m finding that more and more stakeholders are finding ways to push &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; into their processes rather than the other way around. I’ve never met a researcher who did everything right when seeking their initial quick wins to launch a user research practice. Nevertheless, I’m hoping my experiences can give other researchers some actionable insights for getting as close as possible to achieving that ideal initial splash. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to uncover stakeholder perspectives on research: Part two]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/management-strategy-how-to-uncover-stakeholder</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/management-strategy-how-to-uncover-stakeholder</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Part of your onboarding as a UX researcher is getting to know people–a lot of them. Your manager probably earmarked a number of important stakeholders to meet and has told you with whom you’ll be most closely collaborating. You start to schedule meetings and watch your calendar fill up. I remember this moment well—meeting person after person, taking frantic notes and wondering how I would ever organize them into something coherent. It didn’t take long for me to figure out that I needed a systematic approach to learning about the organization and the people inside of it, and most importantly, understanding how my profession would be regarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uncover-stakeholder-perspectives-toward-research/&quot;&gt;In my last article&lt;/a&gt; about stakeholder perspectives toward research, I discussed some common viewpoints that you might encounter. You need a deep understanding of these perspectives to create a customized, strategic plan for research in your organization. There are countless articles describing craft, strategy, advocacy—these are worthwhile to read but always keep in mind the unique environment at your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a UX researcher you have the skills to uncover these perspectives—just point your research expertise at the internal environment, instead of outward at your users. In this article I propose some ways to get to know the perspectives of your key stakeholders. Whatever the method, remember the following best practices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study your stakeholders in both one-to-one and group settings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat your observations over time, as rapidly scaling tech companies will undoubtedly evolve their perspective with the introduction of new team members&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iterate regularly, and apply these internal insights to your research practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, let’s clarify the term “stakeholder.” A stakeholder is anyone in the organization who has an impact on your work. It’s also anyone you can impact &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; your work. Both of these definitions are crucial to keep in mind as you get to know these individuals and the groups in which they reside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting started: who are your key stakeholders, and how should you assess them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re just starting out, one idea is to use a version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/stakeholder-analysis/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Power-Interest Matrix&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Mendelow’s Matrix, to plot your stakeholders along two axes, from low to high power and low to high interest (in UX research). Based on where they fit, you can apply a particular management strategy to each group (manage closely; keep satisfied; keep informed; monitor).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start interviewing, ask your manager or another knowledgeable individual for their opinion on where to plot key stakeholders. Then, you’ll have a baseline going into your first conversations. This matrix is something you can fill in after your individual interviews and group observations (see below) and revisit over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next up: Individual interviews&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solid starting point for getting to know your stakeholders is through individual interviews. Schedule half an hour with each of them and have a few key questions ready. For example, you can ask the stakeholder to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe their role and responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe the types of interactions they currently have with the users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaborate on what they think UX research can do to help improve their understanding of the users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions will also allow you to get a detailed explanation of the products you will work with. They will also uncover the status quo of user knowledge and contact, and will inform you about how stakeholders view UX research as a discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be intimidating to reach out to stakeholders who are far up the hierarchy. But this action can be incredibly valuable—you are demonstrating your desire to get to know them and how they work. You are also showcasing your interviewing skills. No doubt they will have questions for you, and this is a great moment to explain more about the craft of UX research and what user insights can bring to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview protocol can also work in a group setting, but be aware that meeting more than one person at a time will introduce interpersonal dynamics that also should be noted. In my first leadership role, two PMs worked on the same product. The more senior of the two insisted we do our introductory meeting all together, and then dominated the discussion, while the more junior PM didn’t offer much without our prompting. This pair/product initially seemed quite skeptical of UX research as a discipline. As we got to know them better, it turned out the more junior PM was a big advocate for research. Since we didn’t talk to him one-to-one in our initial interview, it took us more time than necessary to understand the complexity of their relationship with each other and to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the time to analyze these interviews, for example by keeping in mind the perspectives discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uncover-stakeholder-perspectives-toward-research/&quot;&gt;in my earlier article&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the information gathered by using the Power-Interest Matrix, you’ll be well on your way to better understanding these stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next up: Group observation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group observation might sound more clinical than it is. What it entails is getting a seat (or a virtual invite) to meetings between your key stakeholders. This could be a weekly check-in with product leadership, a bi-weekly standup between a PM, designer, data scientist, and engineering, or a strategic planning meeting for product and tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why observe? Remember how interviews are best for exploring attitudes, but observation is better to understand actual behavior? This is true for your stakeholders, too. After all, they know you’re there to do research, and unless they are extremely straightforward and honest, you may encounter some social desirability bias in their one-to-one interviews (“yes, of course I love research!”) that emerges as something very different in a group setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things to watch for while attending these meetings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What dynamic do you observe between the product director and their reports? Or the head of design and their team?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are decisions made top-down, with one person at the top of the hierarchy decreeing the direction moving forward? Or are decisions made by consensus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What dynamic do you see between, for example, the PMs? How do they convince each other of their perspective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do your stakeholders reference previous user insights when discussing prioritization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a fascinating business, observing human dynamics. I’ve seen meetings where a product director ordered a list of priorities and the product owners dutifully wrote them down. I’ve been in others where product managers were so forcefully arguing their point that I wondered if fruits and vegetables would start flying around the room. Every company is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing standard meetings is useful, but these group interactions can also be facilitated by you, the UX researcher. Dovetail has a great article detailing &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uxr-maturity/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;how to assess UXR maturity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in your organization. You can and should do this assessment yourself. But another approach is to invite a group of diverse, key stakeholders to do the assessment in a workshop. That way they also learn about their colleagues’ perspectives on UXR, where they align, and how they differ. We took this approach, and in the end, the process resulted in us getting buy-in for our first research operations hire. This happened because decision-makers were able to see the need across the organization for standardizing our research participant recruitment practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With your newfound insights, read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/five-things-create-strong-research-culture/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;how to create a research culture at your organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Explore ways to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-stakeholder-participation-can-make-ux-research-more-agile/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;stakeholders more involved in your research process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, repeat this process regularly. New stakeholders are probably joining your company all the time. Do an introduction interview with them, and watch closely how they fit into existing group dynamics. If you follow these internal insights over time, you will be in great shape to deliver an exceptional, customized UX research practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Janelle Ward, Principal Consultant, Janelle Ward Insights.&lt;/b&gt; Janelle has led UX research at digital product companies, both as a founding lead and as a manager upskilling and growing existing research teams.

The job is about understanding your stakeholder’s views toward users and then communicating research insights to your stakeholders in the most fitting way. This is essential so that they, not just you, have a comprehensive understanding of the user experience and factor these insights into decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence: It doesn’t matter how great of a researcher you are, or how deeply you, personally, understand the needs and pain points of your users. If your stakeholders don’t absorb these insights and apply them to their decision-making, your work will not have impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways to approach this challenge. One example is to find best practices to communicate to stakeholders. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/&quot;&gt;Outlier&lt;/a&gt; has a great article (interviewing their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brswift?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Head of Product&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!) about how to share the value of research to leadership, for example by relating your insights directly to decision making and ROI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important step along the way is assessing the UXR maturity of your organization. Not every company is the same and maturity levels vary. Method in Madness has &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uxr-maturity/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;another article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s key to evaluating and growing UXR maturity at your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s go back to the heart of the challenge: to build a successful research practice, you must deeply understand the perspectives your key stakeholders hold toward their users and toward UX research. Just as &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uxr-maturity/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UXR maturity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; varies between organizations, so do perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The starting point for uncovering these perspectives is interviewing key stakeholders, preferably on an individual basis. The interviews should be semi-structured in nature and consist of the following key questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you please describe your role and responsibilities?&lt;/b&gt; (If the interviewing is with a PM or PO, for example, make sure to use this opportunity to get to know their view on the product(s) for which they are responsible)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What types of interactions do you currently have with the users?&lt;/b&gt; (the goal here is to uncover the status quo)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As UX researchers, what can we do to help improve your understanding of the users? &lt;/b&gt;(This question will give an indication of how this stakeholder views research as a discipline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about some common perspectives you may encounter and how you can best address them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A few key perspectives you may encounter from your non-research stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve led UX research at digital product companies, both as a founding lead and as a manager upskilling and growing an existing research team. A key part of these roles was getting to know my major stakeholders—primarily product managers or product owners—most of whom did not have a background in research. I knew I needed to understand their perspectives quickly before I could dive into research practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your stakeholders is key to success in any job. As I discussed in an earlier article this is part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-grow-ux-research-team/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;looking inward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to understand the existing company mindset toward users and insights-driven decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, we did this through a combination of stakeholder interviewing and observation, which I’ll detail more in a later article. Through the initial stages of getting to know our stakeholders, we were able to identify a number of perspectives. This will vary per organization, and naturally there can be overlap between them. That said, here are some general perspectives to watch out for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skeptical perspectives toward research.&lt;/b&gt; These stakeholders may see research as unnecessary. They view deep understanding of the user as essential to their product leadership role, so why would another person need to do this for them? These stakeholders may also view talking to users as a barrier to innovation. They believe their responsibility is to innovate the product—not ask others how to do it. They do not see how speaking to users could assist in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enthusiastic perspectives toward research. &lt;/b&gt;UX research? Yes, please! These stakeholders are eager to collaborate with UX researchers and are thirsty for user insights that can help them with decision-making. They actively encourage the rest of the organization to interact more with users and champion insights sharing after getting the results of a recent project. At the same time, their actual knowledge about the practice of research may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evolving perspectives toward research.&lt;/b&gt; Falling somewhere in between skeptical and enthusiastic perspectives, these stakeholders see the value of research but are still figuring out how it can best help them in their role. In some cases, they want insights to assist them in their decision-making. In other cases, they still see their own intuition as the best way forward. They want to hear the user perspective but may resist it at certain points in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to address these perspectives in order to set your research practice up for success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don’t be fooled into thinking that one of these perspectives is easier to deal with than the others. Here’s an example: the most &lt;i&gt;skeptical&lt;/i&gt; stakeholder I’ve worked with told us right from the start how unconvinced they felt about our role. This was terrifying to be honest—to come into a job and hear someone in a position of power tell you, directly, that they don’t see value in collaborating. It did, in fact, turn out this way: this was not someone we ended up working with closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this particular stakeholder was actually a blessing in disguise. They gave us the gift of their honesty. All we could do in this situation was thank them for being straightforward. If they raised their hand in meetings, we called on them right away and engaged their concerns as best we could. This may not have changed their mind, but it did demonstrate to the rest of our colleagues that the UX researchers valued open dialogue. In addition, stakeholders who are willing to voice skepticism will force you to up your game—you’ll need to justify your approach, usually with more detail than you would with enthusiasts. This will make you a stronger researcher, even if you find their perspectives hard to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, &lt;i&gt;enthusiastic&lt;/i&gt; stakeholders can also be a challenge. Sometimes, enthusiasm does not equal insight into how the research process actually works. Imagine this scenario: A stakeholder who professes a great love for research accompanies you on a user interview. That user shares some concerns that the stakeholder hasn’t heard before. This is an exciting moment! The stakeholder proceeds to share that user’s perspective far and wide, and even begins initial plans to change prioritization based on what they heard in the interview. On the one hand, it’s incredibly beneficial to have someone so enthusiastic about research. On the other, this stakeholder needs to understand that one interview is not the whole picture—one answer to a question posed in an interview is not the same as research insights that emerge after a project is completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastic stakeholders can be our greatest allies. They can encourage their peers to take the research perspective into account. They can champion insights and challenge their colleagues to consider user insights, especially in those meetings where researchers aren’t yet invited to attend. Harness this enthusiasm and help them become well-informed research advocates by teaching them the art of research, including what it takes to get to those robust insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;evolving&lt;/i&gt; perspectives, the approach can be found somewhere in the middle. Buy-in for one research project does not equal universal endorsement of all research activities. Continuous dialogue—both one-on-one and in larger-scale meetings—might be the most crucial for these stakeholders. &lt;i&gt;Evolving&lt;/i&gt; means they could evolve in either direction—enthusiastic &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; skeptical. You’ll want to ensure that your conversations and collaborations with them are encouraging them toward an insights-driven perspective. You can do this by always addressing concerns and encouraging well-informed endorsements.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, these perspectives should be viewed on a spectrum. Rarely will any stakeholder fit neatly into one of these categories. Often, it’s a positive thing to find a healthy balance of these perspectives in an organization. Particularly in a low-maturity organization, proceed with caution and lots of dialogue. There is a great deal of change that needs to take place in order to become a more insights-driven organization and understanding your stakeholder’s perspectives is essential to this process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Five principles for scaling and democratizing product research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/five-principles-scaling-democratizing-product-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/five-principles-scaling-democratizing-product-research</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today’s leading organizations know that product research is a competitive advantage. As the appetite for quality user insights grows exponentially, it becomes vital to support the organization in its learning. Unfortunately, not all organizations are ready to hire more researchers. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-developer-ratio/&quot;&gt;NNG study&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2020 the average ratio of researchers in product teams was one researcher to five designers to 50 developers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-is-the-democratization-of-user-research/&quot;&gt;democratizing research&lt;/a&gt; can help scale the impact of research by educating and empowering every team in the organization to engage with customers more rigorously, get access to high-quality insights, and make evidence-based decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.co/&quot;&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt;, our mission is to empower product teams to test, learn, and act fast. We believe anyone should be able to access invaluable user insights that inform product and business decisions. Our goal with this article is to provide you with five guiding principles that you can follow to start scaling and democratizing product research in your organization. We’ll cover how to best support the organization’s research needs and enable stakeholders to run their own research confidently and responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify these principles, we’ve interviewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/behzodsirjani/&quot;&gt;Behzod Sirjani&lt;/a&gt;, Founder of Yet Another Studio, and UX leaders and mentors from &lt;a href=&quot;https://adplist.org/&quot;&gt;ADPList&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/haileyc/&quot;&gt;Hailey Clausen&lt;/a&gt;, Product Designer at Clari, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertadombrowski/&quot;&gt;Roberta Dombrowski&lt;/a&gt;, VP of User Research at User Interviews, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/escao/&quot;&gt;Edie Cao&lt;/a&gt;, Sr. Lead UX Researcher at Varis, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Know your organization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to successfully scaling and democratizing product research. Each organization is different—in terms of goals, team composition, and UX maturity—and what works well for one company may not work for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the first thing to do before determining how to scale research is to understand how your organization works, how it makes decisions, and what its needs and goals are. Here are a few questions to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does your organization look like? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does your organization make decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What decisions are being made, and who’s involved in making those decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of evidence do decision-makers need to make informed decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do they get access to this evidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use many methods to answer these questions, including observing work practices and running interviews with stakeholders. Knowing your organization and its research needs is key to determining how to satisfy those needs in a better way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Close the gaps between what your research practice provides and what your organization needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his essay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://yetanother.studio/blog/the-organizational-appetite-for-research&quot;&gt;The Organizational Appetite for Research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/behzodsirjani/&quot;&gt;Behzod Sirjani&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Yet Another Studio, states that “a successful research practice has alignment between how you can feed your organization and what their appetite looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare the answers to the questions above to identify gaps between your research capacity and your organization’s research needs. Are product teams getting access to the evidence they need to make informed decisions? Are there ways to make decisions more effectively? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you identify the gaps and opportunities for improving the decision-making process, think about who’s best suited to participate in research and gather evidence to help close those gaps. For example, designers, product managers, product marketers, and engineers might have some experience conducting research or be interested in learning and practicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are stakeholders who are already engaging with customers and collecting feedback to inform their decision, determine how you can help them make those interactions more rigorous to get relevant, actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an opportunity to learn with each user interaction. We encourage all user-facing teams to gather insights and feedback based on routine conversations they’re already having. Our sales, customer success, and support teams can provide insights that help consistently inform product and design teams.” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/haileyc/&quot;&gt;Hailey Clausen&lt;/a&gt;,  Product Designer at Clari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make it safe for everyone to participate in research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/scaling-user-research-through-democratization/&quot;&gt;Democratizing product research&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t come without risks. You’ll need to find the right balance between allowing everyone to access the insights they need and ensuring every research activity is conducted responsibly and effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeanette Fuccella, Director of Research &amp;amp; Insights at Pendo.io, defines the risk associated with research as &lt;i&gt;the risk of getting it wrong&lt;/i&gt; and provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/building-a-framework-for-prioritizing-user-research-ed46622ead99&quot;&gt;framework for prioritizing user research&lt;/a&gt; that aims to help researchers identify and mitigate risk. (You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-method-discovery-product-management/&quot;&gt;check out the Method in Madness article&lt;/a&gt; where they break this framework down and explain it more detail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to make it safe for everyone to participate in research is to establish what research is appropriate for a democratized practice and what responsibilities you’re willing to share with your stakeholders. Reflect on the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What types of research should you allow non-researchers to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where should they partner with a researcher?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When do you think a project is better led by a researcher?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no right or wrong answers here. Think about your specific needs to determine what approach will work best for your organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userinterviews.com/&quot;&gt;User Interviews&lt;/a&gt;, foundational research projects like mental model studies or strategy questions are led exclusively by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;UX research&lt;/a&gt; team. At the same time, researchers are educating and empowering other teams to run their own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When scaling and democratizing research, UX researchers focus more on enabling others to learn and ensuring we’re focusing on the right things to learn.” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertadombrowski/&quot;&gt;Roberta Dombrowski&lt;/a&gt;, VP of User Research at User Interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Educate and train stakeholders to run their own research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the appropriate safeguards in place, it’s time to educate your stakeholders on what quality research looks like and how to engage with customers, gather accurate insights, and act on them to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create a training program&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to educate stakeholders to run their own research is to create a research training program, but you can also get started by holding dedicated workshops, lunch &amp;amp; learns, and office hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what initiative you choose, think about your audience and their learning goals. Do they have any experience running research? Are they looking for a basic understanding of product research or a more practical approach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have identified your audience, decide which topics you’ll need to cover. These can range from planning a study and choosing the right research method to engaging with customers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.co/blog/leading-questions-examples/&quot;&gt;avoiding leading questions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provide supporting resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equip non-researchers with the necessary tools and resources to run their research activities autonomously and effectively. Valuable resources include decks or knowledge banks with research principles and best practices, playbooks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.co/guides/&quot;&gt;step-by-step guides&lt;/a&gt; with actionable advice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.co/guides/ux-research/ux-research-tools/&quot;&gt;research tool&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/streamline-your-user-research-process-in-seven-simple-steps/&quot;&gt;streamlining the research process&lt;/a&gt;, templates for conducting a study, reaching out to customers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/writing-format-ux-research-report/&quot;&gt;writing research reports&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Put theory into practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no better way to learn than by doing. That’s why you should encourage non-researchers to take part in research activities. “Every team member should feel comfortable getting in touch with customers regularly,” explains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marionkammerer&quot;&gt;Marion Kammerer&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Product Designer at EstimateOne. “This can start as observing research sessions and asking a few questions but ideally leads to more involvement and interest in research activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your stakeholders’ experience and the type of research, provide them with the support they need and give them actionable feedback to keep learning and improving. For example, you could pair non-researchers with experienced researchers or hold office hours to guide them and answer all research-related questions they might have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Training and supporting non-researchers is a critical aspect in many startup product teams. What is important is ensuring a training and education budget and providing a reading list of key books and blogs. Then it’s leading by example, inviting folks to the process, and empowering them to try it themselves. The end result is more people are aware of the problem space and the user needs, independent of the solution space.” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshualederman/&quot;&gt;Joshua Lederman&lt;/a&gt;, VP of Product at Stealth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Assess and iterate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that scaling research is an ongoing process. Things might not go as planned at first, but with time you’ll understand what approach works best for your organization and yields the best results. Try to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start small by focusing on a few initiatives or a specific group of stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your stakeholders and listen to their feedback to learn more about what’s working, the main benefits and challenges, areas of improvement, and opportunities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn along the way and keep iterating to make the process of democratizing research as successful as possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It takes time to scale and democratize research. Non-researchers have different mental models of what it means to do research. Therefore, most of the upfront effort is helping folks unlearn misconceptions and learn fundamentals and best practices,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/escao/&quot;&gt;Edie Cao&lt;/a&gt;, Sr. Lead UX Researcher at Varis. “Research practices lie on a maturity curve. Processes start scrappy and lean—and that’s ok. You’ll iterate and refine in time. Meet folks where they are, and with consistency and effort, you’ll scale your practice to where your org needs it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maximizing the impact of product research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empowering product teams to learn is a great way to expand the impact of product research across the company. We hope these five principles can help you start the process of scaling research in your organization. With adequate education and safeguards, everyone can play an active role in research and make more informed decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for more best practices, real-life examples of how UX leaders apply these principles in their organizations, and insights on how the role of the UX researcher is evolving, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.co/resources/scaling-research-playbook&quot;&gt;Maze x ADPList Playbook: Democratizing Research to Deliver Impact at Scale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Jonathan Widawski, Co-founder &amp;amp; CEO, Maze. &lt;/b&gt;Jonathan Widawski is a veteran Product Designer &amp;amp; former UX teacher.

Now he&amp;#39;s co-founded Maze, a product research platform to enable companies of all sizes to test and learn rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail on tour, coming soon to a town near you]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/catch-us-in-a-town-near-you</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/catch-us-in-a-town-near-you</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our community is at the heart and soul of everything we do at Dovetail, but in recent years the opportunities to meet you all in person have been few and far between.

I say unlikely as startups are renowned for instability, little structure, huge hours, and being not so female-friendly. The reality of startups, which I’ve learned from joining Dovetail, is that startups can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be highly effective - with teams focused on outcomes over output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facilitate flexible hours and working arrangements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivate happier, personally connected teams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fewer systemic barriers that inhibit their ability to respond to the needs of women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less hierarchy means fewer politics and more purposeful work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I believe Dovetail has achieved this for the following reasons:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin and Bradley’s (the Founders) goal is to be the best employer we’ve worked for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early commitment to Project F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 50/50 split of men and women in the leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do Project F and gender diversity matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diverse and inclusive workplace means improved creativity, problem-solving, speed of innovation and profitability&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- in other words, all the good things!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, low gender diversity in technology is a global phenomenon 😔. This is not because there aren’t amazing women in tech to be hired, it is largely due to tech not being a female-friendly industry. One of the main challenges I have observed and personally experienced is women in tech are required to operate in masculine contest cultures. The norms of this culture include;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show no weakness. Never admit doubts or mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endurance (long hours) is valued over output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work comes first and your personal life should not interfere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruthless competition, where winning is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These norms aren’t productive for men or women&lt;/b&gt; - creating anxiety-driven, hyper-competitive, and counterproductive work environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project F is a strategic and progressive program that helps companies to drive action to address challenges women face when working in tech. The program helps to identify and remove the primary and systemic drivers that cause women to seek alternative careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this is important to me.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My decision to join Dovetail, when returning from maternity leave was a decision that made me feel a little crazy at the time. I had a great job, at an awesome and stable company, with supportive leaders and lots of perks that would make returning to work “easy”. So why did I take the gamble? Because I believed that a startup was more likely to offer purposeful work, ownership, flexibility, and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do I need these things more now than ever?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I approached motherhood I became increasingly cognizant that the time I spent at work would come at an opportunity cost. It was important to me that I spent this time in a meaningful, authentic, and productive way. At Dovetail, I have the ability to create outcomes that will not only be positive for the company, but also for me and my family.... which helps with the mum guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to motherhood, I also spent countless hours wondering if I’d have to pursue a different career because I knew I’d need more flexibility. I love being a PM but the nature of the role is that it’s typically “always-on”. I believe having a supportive leadership team and creating an empowered product team will mean this fear is always wasted energy and never a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, being a mom isn’t too different from being a PM - you can have the best-laid plans, but some days the shit hits the fan and you just have to roll with it. I could rant about how parenting comes with endless housework or how breastfeeding is almost a part-time job or how without flexibility I’d drown... but that’s not productive, so instead here is a visual that shows how my life has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A “normal” week in my life, pre, and post motherhood:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is supporting me to return to work part-time and Tuesdays and Thursdays are currently my days off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to ramp up part-time, Dovetail has:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported me with flexible working so I can spend more time with my family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empowered me to change my days or hours when I’ve needed to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a mothers room for me when I told them I was still breastfeeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounded me with an incredibly supportive and understanding team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcomed me into their parents and carers club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any parents considering the move to a startup, I encourage you to be clear on what is important to you at this stage of life and be transparent with the startup you are considering about why this is important. It’s likely that they will surprise you!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to triangulate data from multiple sources in user research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/triangulate-data</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/triangulate-data</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Triangulating data was something I learned in academia. It was always essential to have data from multiple sources to confirm findings. Just interviews or survey data wasn’t enough for my academic research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when I transitioned to user research, I didn’t consider this concept much, especially at the beginning of my career. I learned new methods and ways of working, and triangulation, honestly, fell to the wayside. I conducted and presented usability test results or insights from qualitative interviews. While I battled the “only five participants?!” question, I didn’t think to include other data sources to back up my results or mitigate this concern. I believed a larger sample size was the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, there was a limit. I couldn’t always speak to more people, especially when teams needed results quickly. And, for a while, I felt stuck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, I was grappling with a terrible experience for one of the products I worked on. However, we didn’t have clear quantitative data to show any issues. So I decided to take a peek at our reviews. I had hit gold. Many of the negative comments had to do with the feature in question. That moment sparked in my brain and reminded me of the power of multiple data sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of triangulation in user research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to triangulate data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data triangulation&lt;/b&gt;: Gathering data from different times, spaces, and people, such as a longitudinal study or comparing data from different locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Investigator triangulation&lt;/b&gt;: Including multiple researchers in collecting and analyzing data and comparing code sheets or findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theory triangulation&lt;/b&gt;: Involving different theoretical frameworks, such as testing a variety of hypotheses behind motivation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methodological triangulation&lt;/b&gt;: Using varying methods to approach the same topic, such as a survey and interviews in the same study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We generally focus on methodological and data triangulation for user research. However, I have also seen investigator triangulation on larger teams and theory triangulation at hypothesis-driven companies. Nevertheless, methodological and data triangulation are the easiest and most common ways to approach triangulation in user research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to use triangulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I remembered the power of triangulation, I wanted to use it all the time. Soon, I tried to triangulate data for every single study. And it became similar to me trying to test everything with research back in my early career. I couldn’t triangulate &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;, and it wasn’t necessary to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then shifted my mindset to help me understand when it was necessary to triangulate and when I could let it go. For a while, I based my decision on time. Did I have enough time and resources to triangulate my research? However, I slowly moved away from resources and toward risk. I started asking myself how significant the risk was if we made decisions solely on one method or data source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used triangulation as a way to mitigate risk. After some time, I realized that triangulation was helpful in the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see a complete picture of the research problem or users, gaining multiple perspectives into how or why someone is thinking, feeling, or acting in a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the validity of my study by combining complementary methods and mitigating biases or limitations from using only one method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give insights more credibility by cross-checking other sources to see if the data lines up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These situations allow me to reduce risky decision-making, especially if the results are confusing or fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to triangulate data in user research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few ways to use triangulation in user research, and the majority of sources are available to most researchers. The main ways I triangulate research are through checking sources like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer support tickets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews of the product &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analytics/product usage data &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholder interviews, such as speaking with account managers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/mixed-methods-research/&quot;&gt;Mixed methods approach&lt;/a&gt;, such as using a survey to follow up on qualitative interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multiple metrics to assess usability (e.g. time on task, task success, number of errors)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intercept surveys (e.g. SUS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some concrete examples of implementing triangulation into your next study for each situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;To see a complete picture &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, we put the System Usability Scale up on our platform to assess the platform’s overall usability and satisfaction. Unfortunately, we received a few low scores regarding the platform’s ease of use. However, we had no idea why users rated it so poorly. So we spoke to account managers to understand any issues from their perspective, and they gave us some areas of concern that several users had brought to their attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to run a usability test to assess the underperforming areas of the platform better. We uncovered the root of the issues and why users faced them with this test. This approach helped us discover the &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;, giving us a more holistic picture of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;To enhance the validity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a larger scale persona study where we interviewed 15 people from one of our segments. There was an influx of insights, ranging from needs to pain points, and we had a lot of qualitative data. However, we had no idea how this data generalized to the larger population or how to prioritize it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase the study’s validity, we sent a follow-up opportunity gap survey to assess the levels of importance and current satisfaction of our different insights. This survey helped us determine the most important insights to our users and what they are least satisfied with. It also allowed us to prioritize the qualitative data into a persona better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also combined this with data analytics to confirm areas that users cited as pain points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;To give insights more credibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We focused on usability testing a newly developed feature for this study. Unfortunately, we didn’t have much time, so we chose a segment to focus on and tested with seven participants from that segment. We found that four out of seven participants struggled with a particular task. However, this data did not feel conclusive to make any significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to look at the analytics data we gathered throughout the past few weeks the feature was available. We found an extensive drop-off rate through this data at the same point in the experience that we saw a struggle in the usability test. In addition, we reached out to customer support and learned they recently received a high influx of tickets complaining about this feature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are infinite ways to use multiple sources and methods to triangulate your data. I highly recommend trying it in your next study, especially if you are in one of the above situations and trying to mitigate risk!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

We often look to the creative teams at software companies like Figma, Shopify, Intercom, Notion, and Dropbox for inspiration. Like them, we want to create engaging and memorable brand experiences that resonate with our audience. Read on to discover how we make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our vision is for the Creative Studio to be the creative nucleus for all things at Dovetail, operating as an internal ‘agency,’ made up of designers, illustrators, producers, writers, animators, engineers, thinkers, and makers. The studio will collaborate with folks all over the company to execute creative projects big, small, and first-of-their-kind at Dovetail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their primary goal is to expand and evolve our house of brands to resonate with our growing audience while maintaining the character and weirdness that makes us unique. The studio has the creative freedom and autonomy to explore different styles, mediums, techniques, and ultimately create unique and unforgettable work. Work that doesn’t just look good but makes you feel something too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are &lt;i&gt;just some&lt;/i&gt; examples of projects this team might take on.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting our brands through micro-sites, in-product experiences, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/events/&quot;&gt;in-person experience&lt;/a&gt;, swag, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating an immersive in-person branded experience for our first customer conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making our next office an inspiring place to work. Think murals, flags, themed meeting rooms, and installations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing a new and engaging experience for our multimedia playground. Including articles, podcasts, videos, photography, illustration, interactive elements, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing a Dovetail van to drive around and recruit new hires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do all of this in-house?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of top-notch design shops in Sydney that we could hire to take on creative projects. Here’s why we’re building our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branding is strategically essential to our success and not something we want to outsource. We need to build this muscle ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Creative Studio works closely with internal stakeholders, leading to better ideas and a fast feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We move fast. Our products are constantly evolving, and as a result, our brand needs to evolve continuously. We want a team that can build and maintain context over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good design and visual communication are important to Dovetail. We have a high bar and an incredibly talented team.

Would I sound like a robot? Would the participant feel like they were in a police interrogation? Would I ask too many questions? Too few? And, most scary, would I bias, lead, or confuse the participant? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; questions spinning through my mind, it was challenging for me to write my discussion guides. And, because of that, my questions felt stunted and forced. As a result, I often struggled to go deep with participants and have them open up during these sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I met TED(W)—who got the &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt; reference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEDW is an acronym I use to create open-ended, unbiased questions that get participants to tell you stories about their past experiences. Because, when it comes down to it, we do qualitative user research to get these stories. Stories turn into &lt;a href=&quot;https://dscout.com/people-nerds/writing-user-insights&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that turn into &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-report-recommendations-examples/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;highly actionable recommendations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can help your teams make better, user-centric decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do we use TEDW to write the best interview questions? First, we have to plan for success!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start with your question and goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know me, I am (annoyingly) strict about beginning projects with valid and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/research/research-questions/&quot;&gt;answerable research questions&lt;/a&gt; and goals. I always begin this way because I have learned it is imperative to the success of a project. If you don&amp;#39;t have a clear research question and goals, you will have difficulty creating discussion questions that make sense to you, your stakeholders, and the participant. Without a solid research question and goals, you can find yourself all over the place, with little focus, in your interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to write a good research question&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A good research question is&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centered around understanding or discovering something about people (not your product)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A problem/idea we don&amp;#39;t fully understand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concept or idea we need more information on to move forward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Often, I get asked to answer questions like&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do users prefer this or that design?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do people like the product/feature/idea?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can users use the product/feature/idea?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Would people use the product/feature/idea?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do people find value in the product/feature/idea?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do users want?&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Do users want this product/feature/idea?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is this product/feature/idea (good) enough for users?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry in advance, but these questions aren’t answerable by qualitative research! These are impossible to answer between the small sample size of qualitative research and future-based questions. So if you get questions like this, you can instead propose:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do users prefer this or that design?” -&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;A/B testing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do people like the app?” -&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;look at usability/satisfaction &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can users use the app?” -&amp;gt; “&lt;b&gt;How do users interact with the app?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Would people use the feature?” -&amp;gt; “&lt;b&gt;Have people used something similar before, and what was their experience like?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do users want?” / “Do users want this product/feature/idea?” -&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Focus on top pain points through a survey and solve those&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is this product/feature/idea (good) enough for users?” -&amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;look at usability/satisfaction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do people find value in the product?” -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dscout.com/people-nerds/intersection-market-user-research&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;market research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;b&gt; value prop brainstorming, or &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/product-market-fit-ux-research/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;product-market fit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do we write a good research question? Valid research questions for qualitative research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with “how” or “why”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are about processes, mental models, journeys, and perceived feelings/impact &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on the past rather than the future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about the questions you have and what you are trying to learn, and ensure it is something you can answer with qualitative research. And then, you can use the following formulas to create a valid research question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do users [think about/make decisions on/interact with] [subject of research/product]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do users perceive [process/event/concept]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do users perceive and report the impact of [process/event/concept]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a previous research question I’ve asked before:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do our users plan for &lt;b&gt;leisure travel?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to write research goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is writing research goals based on your initial question. Research goals are specific ideas or areas you want to learn more about during the research/the questions you want to answer. They break the larger research question into smaller, answerable parts. You might find them slightly repetitive of the initial question, so you’re doing it right if that&amp;#39;s the case!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These goals help you focus your interviews and get the most pertinent information from participants. Luckily, there are five overarching research goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover people’s current processes/decision-making about [research subject], and how they feel about the overall experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about people’s current pain points, frustrations, and barriers about [current process/current tools] and how they would improve it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncover the current tools people use to [achieve goal] and their experience with those tools. Also, uncover how they would improve those tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand what [research subject] means to people (how they define it) and why it is important to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluate how people are using a [product/website/app/ service] OR Evaluate how people are currently interacting with a [product/ website/app/service]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if we think about qualitative research, specifically generative research, three goals, in particular, stand out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover people’s current processes/decision-making about [research subject], and how they feel about the overall experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about people’s current pain points, frustrations, and barriers about [current process/current tools] and how they would improve it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand what [research subject] means to people (how they define it) and why it is important to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research findings should ultimately answer the research question and all the goals. By building these goals, I can ensure I ask the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; questions and create a path to guide participants down. Often a research question might be a broad topic, so these objectives narrow the scope while allowing for natural conversation and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some sample goals based on the above research question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover people’s decision-making about planning leisure travel and how they feel about the overall experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about people’s current pain points, frustrations, and barriers about planning leisure travel and how they would improve it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand what leisure travel means to people and why it is important to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;And now, the discussion guide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, it will become clear why I harped on research questions and goals earlier on. Each interview question you write should be related to your research goals and question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s go back to TEDW as a method for writing these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TEDW stands for&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T = &amp;quot;Tell me more about...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E = “Explain…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D = “Describe…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;W = &amp;quot;Walk me through...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spend less time thinking about what to say next with these types of questions. Additionally, the TEDW framework means I am not always asking “why, why, why” repeatedly, but I can still dig deeper into what the user is saying. The TEDW framework is not about &lt;i&gt;asking questions&lt;/i&gt; but about having open-ended conversations. Instead of asking people direct questions, you use active listening and open-ended statements to extract the stories from them. Using this technique makes it a lot easier for participants to give you reliable past data, as it reduces biases that come through in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start writing TEDW questions, go back to your question and goals. Write down all the questions you would want to ask to answer each goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So taking the example above, it might look like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover people’s decision-making about planning leisure travel and how they feel about the overall experience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do people make decisions to plan a leisure trip?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the step-by-step process for planning a leisure trip?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do people feel while planning a leisure trip?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about people’s current pain points, frustrations, and barriers about planning leisure travel and how they would improve it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are people’s pain points when it comes to planning leisure travel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are some frustrating experiences people have had while planning leisure travel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did they do when they encountered those experiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did they feel during the experiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would they improve those experiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand what leisure travel means to people and why it is important to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does planning leisure travel mean to people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important or unimportant is leisure travel to people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does planning leisure travel fit into people&amp;#39;s lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then take these questions and turn them into TEDW-based questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you have your discussion guide! I always recommend three to five questions per goal and always write them in priority order, just in case you run out of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these questions should get participants to share their past experiences with you. And, whenever there is a break in the conversation, you can always go deeper by either asking “why” or using another TEDW phrased question. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participant: &lt;/b&gt;I was frustrated when customer support wouldn’t answer my calls after seeing they changed my flight completely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/b&gt; Explain what you mean by frustrated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interview:&lt;/b&gt; Talk me through what you did next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEDW is a way to start conversations and begin the storytelling process. Once the participant starts giving you nuggets of the story, you can dig deeper into the critical parts based on our research goals. So give it a try in your next project!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

A trend was born when tools started coming out to enable testing prototypes or concepts on a mobile device. Suddenly, I went from being stuck to testing prototypes with those near me to a whole wide world of usability testing. This news was fantastic because we had users across the pond in Europe, and, as much as I loved traveling, it wasn’t feasible to do for each project and idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first remote mobile test I did was with a prototype on Invision. It was with a client we had run several usability tests with, so I felt comfortable with them being a guinea pig. But, let me tell you, it was horrible. Everything that could have gone wrong did:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The client hadn’t done remote &lt;i&gt;mobile &lt;/i&gt;testing, so they didn’t read the part of my email asking them to download the Invision app onto a mobile device&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participant had no idea how to sign into Zoom on their mobile device&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing screens on mobile, once they finally got on to Zoom and downloaded Invision (at this point, we’re 15 minutes into our 45-minute session), proved to be impossible to explain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hot spots on Invision were not great for the mobile experience at the time, and it was tough to get through the prototype meaningfully&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that complete blunder of a test, I decided to do remote mobile testing on a desktop. So, the participant would open the Invision link, which would show as a phone, and navigate through it on their desktop. Despite being less than ideal, I pushed through with this idea for some time. I had no idea how to set up a proper remote mobile test, especially for less experienced or new participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, I was terrified of remote mobile usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, many tools and guides have come out since then, making remote mobile testing less of a nightmare. However, it is still one of the more difficult methodologies to do well. It takes a lot of planning, a bit of luck, and a sense of “fake it ’til you make it” from the researcher. After running many (too many!) remote usability tests, I have finally found a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to use a remote mobile test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are times when remote mobile usability tests are the best approach for a project, but not always. So before you go down the remote mobile testing rabbit hole, ensure it is the best method for your goals. These are scenarios when I choose to use remote mobile testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I need to reach a diverse participant sample, especially in inaccessible and varied locations &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we need to do research quickly across several different segments or personas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I need more participants and need to lower the cost of the test to include more people (remote testing tends to cost less than in-person)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I have a group of stakeholders interested in observing each of the sessions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we need the participant to be in a particular context/environment, such as at work or home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and of course, if there is a global pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from these scenarios, it is also essential to look at the benefits and drawbacks of remote usability testing to see if it is the best fit for your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The pros of remote usability testing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allows you to test prototypes, ideas, or concepts with a broader audience and more diverse participant sample&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can test with specific markets or locations without being near them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environment in which you’re testing (e.g. usually a participant’s home) is more realistic than a usability lab or them coming into an office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times, it can decrease the cost of testing due to less travel or necessary equipment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cons of remote usability testing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants typically have to download software to run on their mobile devices (or multiple types of software)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With many tools, you can’t see the participant’s hand gestures, body language, or exactly where they click—you can just see the screen changing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembering to share permissions so participants can open a prototype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having to do a lot of “in-the-session” work, such as sharing the link with the participant (so they don’t see it ahead of time), sharing screens, opening the right software, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With specific tools, you cannot see the participants face during testing, and they cannot see you, reducing the rapport and potentially impacting the comfort of the participant &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have little control over the environment, including distractions or internet connectivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always consider the scenario and weigh the pros and cons before choosing this approach. That way, I know what to expect and can best plan for any obstacles or bumps along the road. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to run a remote mobile test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’ve decided a remote mobile test is the right path for you. Despite the hardships, they can be fun and extremely rewarding with fascinating insights from various participants. Here is how I set up and run my remote mobile usability tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Define your research question and goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything (for any study), make sure you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/elevate-your-research-objectives-745cf9415d5b&quot;&gt;well-defined research question and goals&lt;/a&gt;. These goals will help ensure you are indeed picking the correct method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create the tasks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of usability testing is tasks. You ask participants to perform specific actions and essentially see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the person can do this task (effectiveness)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How difficult or easy it is for the person to complete the task (efficiency)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to any remote testing, you need to ensure your tasks are easy to understand and complete. Take the time to create your scenarios and tasks to ensure participants can properly navigate and execute them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide on moderated or unmoderated testing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;I won’t go too deep on moderated versus &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-running-unmoderated-tests/&quot;&gt;unmoderated testing&lt;/a&gt; here, but it is a consideration. If this is your first remote mobile usability test, I recommend moderated testing because it will teach you how to write straightforward, actionable tasks. With unmoderated testing, you can get a lot of mediocre data, especially if your tasks are even remotely vague. When in doubt, start with moderated testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose a tool&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do this step in parallel or even before the previous steps. It is impossible to conduct remote mobile testing without a tool. There are many tools to consider (check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airtable.com/universe/exp7BidtSB73ihAqw/user-research-tool-box?explore=true&quot;&gt;this table&lt;/a&gt; and filter by remote research category). Some of the considerations I take into account when choosing a tool are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easy to use for participants&lt;/b&gt;. You can test this internally with your colleagues to determine how difficult it is to download and use the tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compatibility with devices.&lt;/b&gt; Is the tool only compatible with Apple or Android? What devices will we need to test?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The participants’ privacy.&lt;/b&gt; Can you do things such as snoozing notifications while the participant’s screen is shared?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The necessary features.&lt;/b&gt; You should look for features such as screen sharing, recording, and observer capabilities &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost.&lt;/b&gt; How expensive is the tool, and how often will we use it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auxiliary features&lt;/b&gt;. Do you need features for recruitment or integrations with other tools you currently use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite tool for remote mobile testing? Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recruit participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure you are recruiting the correct participants with the necessary criteria. For example, focus on psychographics, not demographics, through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/seven-steps-to-writing-a-screener-survey-1c75cf19c585&quot;&gt;screener survey&lt;/a&gt;. Also, consider timezones when you are recruiting a global sample!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do a dry run&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going into the wild (or real-world), conduct a dry run or two with colleagues to ensure everything goes smoothly. Yes, this doesn’t mean everything will be perfect with the participant, but it will help you recognize any bumps or bugs before the actual test. In addition, a dry run will make you feel more confident and comfortable during real tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conduct the test!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is time to conduct the test after all the planning. Get set up about 10 minutes before the test and be prepared to refresh your email looking for “help” pleas from participants. Ensure all links work and you’ve turned the permissions on for the prototype. Whenever usability testing, make sure to observe what participants are doing in addition to the feedback they give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And take a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I have done this quite a few times, and here are a few lessons I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plan ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan, test, and practice. Use the time before the test to try different scenarios where things may go awry. The best training I did with colleagues was fake bad scenarios. The colleague would have everything go wrong, and we would have to fix it during the session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Have a backup plan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned this the hard way—always have a backup plan. If you are conducting a 45-minute test and you’ve burned through 15 to 20 minutes trying to connect to the software, be ready to switch to plan B (or even plan C). If Zoom doesn’t work, have a Google Meet link ready; if the participant can’t share the screen, be prepared to share your screen and give remote access; if the software isn’t working, have the prototype ready to test on a desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Think about your participants’ skills&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I consulted for a company with quite a few older generation audiences who were critical to their revenue and market. Getting some participants to &lt;i&gt;use a computer&lt;/i&gt; was a feat, but getting them to do remote mobile testing proved impossible. If you will waste time getting a participant base to use your software, consider a different method. It might be better to test in-person with fewer people than barely get any data from more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Record an onboarding video&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recording an onboarding video for people to watch before the session has been vital in my successful studies. I record a video (across devices) of how to download and open the software, share the screen, and what they can expect. When people watch this beforehand, the session always goes much more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Two pivotal human-centered approaches for repository planning]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/human-centered-approaches-for-repository-planning</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/human-centered-approaches-for-repository-planning</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What does it take to ensure your &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt;’s success? Beyond the obvious topics to address like tooling, tagging, and taxonomies, you must also account for people- and behavior-based approaches. For example, a well-planned internal research study is essential, as well as an understanding of how your organization practices knowledge management. These human-centered, organizational tasks are pivotal and can unlock potential not just for your repository but also for your research practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break down silos with internal research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common concerns in product organizations is the presence of silos. Silos are problematic because they stifle communication between teams, which results in huge inefficiencies and a lack of innovation. A research repository can and should address the problem of siloed work. So naturally, you’ll want to think broadly about who your stakeholders will be when implementing a repository. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should begin your repository initiative with internal research. Talk to all of your stakeholders—not just producers of research but consumers of research as well. This will likely include cross-functional teams as well as product managers and designers. Can these folks identify the need for a repository? Does their reasoning match up with your own? Make sure that you’re checking in with your bias on the regular. Be sure you’re not imposing your own desires for a repository onto your research with others (who may not feel the same urgency as you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start creating a more targeted approach as you begin to take the temperature of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/five-things-create-strong-research-culture/&quot;&gt;research culture&lt;/a&gt; around you. Are you able to identify the early adopters of your repository? If so, bring them onto your repository team to help champion the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to bring your findings back to the research teams—be transparent about your research process. This will help build trust and open up conversations about people’s concerns. This process will also help you devise a communication plan. What will be the most effective way to communicate your progress as you begin the implementation of a repository?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the appetite for a repository and identifying internal requirements is a lot of work. There will be difficult conversations that may shift your focus and present roadblocks. But stay focused and don’t be tempted to skimp on your internal research—the success of your repository depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowledge management is your secret sauce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building and managing a repository requires knowledge management skills that help you create, share, and manage knowledge efficiently within an organization. For repositories, knowledge management activities include creating naming conventions, templates, and taxonomies to improve identification, organization, and findability. The more people who are on board with the activities, the better. It’s worth thinking about how you can create an awareness of (and hopefully implement!) these skills in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me give an example. Say you’re working on a research study with your team. You have a shared workspace where you store documents—but folks don’t always use it. Your shared workspace probably contains “mystery documents” of questionable origin and unknown purpose. Maybe the file names aren’t descriptive, and it takes a while to find what you’re looking for. Maybe a new team member goes into the workspace to get a sense of what a current project looks like—they open a document or two, but have no idea what they’re looking at. Here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put everything into &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; shared space. And I mean everything. Add links to boards and other tools. In my experience, you’ll have to keep reminding people to put their working documents in that one space. Just remember this archivist’s creed: “Everyone should know where everything is, all of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create some best practices around file naming and use a “notes” or “description” field if you can (you can usually find this field next to “date” and “created by”). Most tools have a way to enter descriptive information into the organizational structure—use this feature! The goal is to look at the list of documents and know exactly what they are and what they were used for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add descriptions into the document. Write in a “this document was created to …” at the top of each document. When your teammates look at the document six months from now, they will know why it was created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise! You’ve created the story of your research project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little-known benefit of establishing some knowledge management behaviors is that you create a story. Or rather, a history. When you look at a list of well-named, identifiable documents, you can make sense of a timeline. Maybe you see some gaps or lessons learned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories behind research studies are not captured in reports, yet these stories contain incredibly valuable learnings. An approach that didn’t work and was abandoned. A roadblock that others may run into. A way of working that was problematic. These are the learnings that can help elevate research at your organization by informing strategic research planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to capture research stories could be a structured debrief after a project is complete. The research team is asked to discuss a set of questions (e.g., was this study successful? Were there blockers? What were they?). You can capture the debrief on video—a light-lift method that would also document the nuances of the discussion. These videos would then be available to the research team to review as they take on new research studies and projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers can see the paths that have already been traversed, then they can create new ones—rather than retracing their steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Dr. Emily DiLeo, Research Repository Specialist. &lt;/b&gt;Dr. Emily DiLeo is an ethnomusicologist and archivist working in UXR.

You’ve created a&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-grow-ux-research-team/&quot;&gt; vision and a hiring strategy&lt;/a&gt;. You’ve gone through the process of&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-grow-ux-research-team-jd-interview/&quot;&gt; thoughtfully hiring new team members&lt;/a&gt;. Every day, you build and nurture relationships with important stakeholders in your organization and champion insights-driven decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your organization’s maturity and level of experience, this might already feel like a full plate. What could be more critical than shifting your company’s view toward their users and research in general? Especially for a researcher, could there possibly be a nobler undertaking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is: In addition to all these responsibilities, you are a people manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause for a minute. You’re in this role because you are an expert at what you do. You can make sound arguments, understand people’s perspectives, and persuade them to consider yours. But you’re also in this role because you chose people management. In people management, your expertise will take you far. But it won’t take you all the way—because we’re now talking about professional responsibility for other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my time managing people at digital product companies, HR has framed people management as a high calling with duties like assigning and guiding work priorities, conducting performance reviews, and ensuring reports feel cared for within the organization. The role is accomplished through a skilled combination of mentorship and coaching. As a UX research manager, this responsibility falls on your shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing from multiple definitions, “from the heart” means to do something sincerely, free from pretense, not dishonestly or hypocritically. Let’s talk about three ways you can manage from the heart: focusing on how your reports will feel when they leave your team, viewing the one-on-one with your reports as an exclusive space for their growth, and creating and regularly steering a plan for their future success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From the start, focus on the end&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management is like being in a relationship that you know will end someday. Ideally, when the relationship ends, your team member will leave feeling like they’ve had a positive experience: they’ve grown as a professional, and they’ve had a trusting, supportive relationship with you, their manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging this finite factor may seem a bit taboo. After all, we don’t enter other types of relationships like friendships or romances expecting them to end—we often hope they will last a lifetime. However, nearly all employees will leave their role one day due to a transfer, promotion, or a position at another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try it out—acknowledge to your team members that they won’t stay forever. They are in the role because you both felt it was a good fit. It’s already clear that there’s a visible trajectory for them to follow and grow through. If you both do your jobs well, they will proceed along that trajectory and eventually outgrow the job you hired them for. Your duty as a manager? Help them leave that role feeling like they have grown and were exceptionally supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an approach is not so different from the process we use for scoping research projects. We’ll often ask our stakeholders what they expect to see at the end of the project. That way, we ensure expectations are in line with what we are capable of delivering as researchers. We can do this for the professional development of our team members, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The one-to-one is an exclusive space for your reports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve had a busy week, meetings turning your calendar into a colorful array of face-to-face (or video-mediated) responsibilities. Your one-on-one conversations with your reports are scattered among them, ideally occurring once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve just come out of a few hours of difficult meetings. Another one-to-one has crept up on you. You’re friendly with the team member with whom you’ll be speaking, and you’re tempted to start the one-to-one by venting about a particularly irritating stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First thing to keep in mind—the one-to-one is never about you. It’s about them. It isn’t a conversation between friends, no matter how friendly you are. As the manager, you can keep this conversation focused on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second thing: the one-to-one might be your team member’s only chance to step out of the day-to-day and take a bird’s eye view of their processes, celebrations, and challenges. It’s their chance to view progress in increments, measured in the time since you’ve last spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can set the tone in your first one-to-one conversation. I love the format I originally learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/&quot;&gt;Lara Hogan&lt;/a&gt;. She has a whole series of questions for getting to know your report, my favorite being the questions around how to know when your report is grumpy. Lara also suggests you cover topics related to “feedback and recognition” and “goals and support.” Importantly, there is a question about how your team member likes to treat themselves. So, when there is cause for celebration, you will know exactly what will put light in their eyes when you surprise them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating and steering a plan for your team member’s future success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember all that time you spent on a hiring strategy and the effort you put into scoping your report’s new role? Also, think back to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-grow-ux-research-team-jd-interview/&quot;&gt;interview process&lt;/a&gt; that gave your new report the confidence and enthusiasm to accept their new role. You’ve hired thoughtfully, and you can use that same thoughtfulness to keep your team members growing in their roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a quarterly discussion of your report’s professional dreams and goals, like a personal version of a vision and strategy. It lets your team member step out of their daily work by imagining the future and the steps needed to get there. This plan is mainly the responsibility of your team member, although it’s an important discussion point in your one-one-ones. It promotes active control of your report’s career trajectory, and it sends the message that it’s not taboo for them to share future plans with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Career goals and dreams can relate to simple decisions like whether to focus on an IC or management track. Do they want to eventually work for an agency or jump into a consulting gig? Maybe they want to specialize in an area that isn’t relevant to your company, but it could be a dream fit for a different organization. What do they need to do to transition into this specialized role successfully?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating joint involvement in such a plan lets your report know you will do whatever is in your power to help them grow. Once they get there, you can have an honest conversation about their best next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s that well-known saying—employees don’t leave companies, they leave managers. If we can manage our UX researchers from the heart, they will leave because they’ve reached their full potential and genuinely want to find a new challenge. Be the boss they rave about for years—not the one they tried to get away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve got this, people manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Janelle Ward, Principal Consultant, Janelle Ward Insights. &lt;/b&gt;Janelle has led UX research at digital product companies, both as a founding lead and as a manager upskilling and growing existing research teams.

Founders have different ideas about what resources are needed to build a successful high-growth software company, and an artist on the team typically doesn’t make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the (many) reasons Dovetail stands out for creatives. The founders’ early vision held brand on the same level as design, development, or customer success. They understood from the very beginning what effectively deployed creative work can do for a business. Today, along with its product, Dovetail’s brand is one of its most compelling assets. And the creatives who have worked here from the early days have been vital to its success with the nascent investment continuing to return dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering what it’s like to work at an organization that considers creativity as central to its mission, then read on to see what members of our creative team have to say about their experiences working in software, why they moved into tech, and the impact they have across the business today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lu—Senior Visual Designer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, custom illustration is pure brand magic. Unfortunately, many organizations see it as a luxury that they don’t have time for, but it’s no secret that the best brands invest in creativity. Suppose I made a Venn diagram of distinct and memorable brands and those that have employed illustration beautifully and strategically in their creative arsenal, there’s lots of cross-over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s a reason for that. Illustrations quickly provide tone and atmosphere. They give the time-poor customer a wealth of data at just a glance. It’s also a great way to slow the viewer down—to encourage them to peer more closely and take in all the details. And just like logos, colors, and typography, illustrations aid brand recognition. They also provide visible evidence that the company takes time and care to refine its image, and the product itself inherits that impression and assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of illustration is often challenging to measure. It can be an uphill battle to justify the investment and redirect time and spend. So when I saw that Dovetail was already championing illustration as part of their brand magic—and had not one but two full-time illustrators in-house—I knew there was something special happening here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lisa—Artist in Residence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After working as a graphic designer at an agency for a few years, I decided to pursue my illustration passion full-time. In a fortunate turn of events, my now colleague reached out via email—she wanted my help to create Dovetail’s brand illustration system. Suffice to say; she’d piqued my interest. It’s rare for a company as small as Dovetail (with 11 employees at the time) to bring on a full-time illustrator to create unique illustrations from scratch. Since Dovetail didn’t have any visual brand guidelines, I wanted to make something extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about six months of creating custom illustrations on the fly, we went through a company-wide brand refresh. This included creating brand guidelines that could help us scale creative at Dovetail. We had weeks of branding workshops that incorporated cross-functional creativity, sprawling brainstorms of new and exciting approaches, and discussions around our core values and how we’d translate them into our new brand. After weeks of reimagining the brand, we rolled it out across all of our channels—just like that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m proud to say that Dovetail’s illustrations are among some of the most recognizable elements of the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tia—Artist in Residence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my friend sent me the Illustrator role at Dovetail, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The respect for illustration as a core brand pillar that is somewhat commonplace in Silicon Valley or Berlin was nowhere to be seen in the Australian market. Could this be the first point in a wave of change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to know more, so I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/lisanooin/&quot;&gt;stalked the existing creative—Lisa&lt;/a&gt;. It didn’t take me too long to uncover a captivating assortment of her work, and to say I was impressed is a complete understatement. From what’s she’s achieved at Dovetail to her personal pursuits, this girl is a hands-down inspiration. So naturally, I wanted to work with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I find myself working not only with Lisa but with an awe-inspiring team whose collective vision, drive, and ambition keep me motivated to push boundaries and keep exploring my creative potential. I’d like to think I’m not only speaking for myself when I say this—we’re building a brand and product that I genuinely believe in, and, for me, that makes the experience all the sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you looking to get creative with us?

Talking to people about random topics and understanding how their minds worked was a thrilling concept. It fed just enough of my want-to-be psychologist side and incorporated the exciting pace of technology and product companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent a few years avoiding quantitative data. It&amp;#39;s not that I didn&amp;#39;t appreciate it or think it was helpful; I honestly wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable using it in the context of user research. I admired data scientists and product analysts and longed to use their knowledge, but I was immediately overwhelmed every time I dove into something like R or Tableau. Or if I had a bunch of survey data to visualize—that was straight out of my nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I got to a point in my career where I could no longer hide behind qualitative data. Not only did some of the validity of my results get called into question, but growing as a user researcher meant I had to obtain more skills. It was time to take my qualitative-colored glasses off and incorporate a mixed methods research approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is mixed methods research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the name aptly suggests, mixed methods research means mixing different types of research during a project. Typically we look at research from two sides:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research, which includes conversations, mental models, feelings, reactions, and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative research, which is more geared toward behavior, product analytics, and generalizing data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, qualitative research enables us to get deep and rich insights from a small sample size. In contrast, quantitative research allows us to generalize our findings across a larger sample to understand the audience more broadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, qualies and quanties were on opposite sides of a spectrum and, often, debated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-quantitative-research/&quot;&gt;quantitative vs qualitative &lt;/a&gt;approach. However, we need both sides of this spectrum to understand our customers (and potential customers) accurately. Without one side, we are out of balance and can&amp;#39;t draw as valid or reliable conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mixed methods research designs &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I initially started my journey with mixed methods, I thought there was only one way: collect the qualitative data and validate it with quantitative data. Essentially, I would do some interviews and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/analyze-open-ended-survey-questions/&quot;&gt;follow-up with a survey&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are three main ways to incorporate mixed method research design into your toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exploratory sequential design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was most familiar with this design of mixed methods. For this approach, you start with qualitative research and use your insights to frame the design and analysis of a quantitative study. The goal of an exploratory sequential design would be to understand the scope of qualitative insights across a much larger sample. So, how valid are your insights across a wider audience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I did an exploratory sequential design study that included a diary study (qualitative component) and an opportunity gap survey (quantitative part). We wanted to understand how people thought about fashion trends. We had about 15 participants in our two-week diary study, asking them about their thoughts on fashion. This approach led to &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; of data, and there was no way we could &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-data-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;prioritize the insights&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, we created an opportunity gap survey after we collected the patterns and trends (through &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;affinity diagrams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example (and I&amp;#39;ve replaced the actual data with dummy data), we found the following insights from our diary study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wanted to share outfits with friends easily&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wanted to recreate expensive outfits on a budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wanted to find vintage versions of outfits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People wanted to shop online with others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, our opportunity gap survey, which went out to about 1000 people, asked about the importance and current satisfaction with these insights. We then prioritized the very important insights that people felt unsatisfied with. So, instead of wrangling with many qualitative data points, we gained prioritized areas to focus on with our teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Explanatory sequential design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explanatory sequential design goes in the opposite direction. This design begins with a quantitative component, which you then dive deeper into using qualitative research. If you are unsure where to focus your qualitative efforts next, explanatory sequential design can help. You look at the large-scale issues, see where the major pain points lie and follow up with qualitative research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at one company, we struggled to understand our customers&amp;#39; pain points deeply. It felt like we kept jumping from one issue to the next, with no clear understanding of why something was happening or the severity of the problem. I went into our product analytics and noted where people were dropping off in our conversion funnel. I then sent out a large-scale survey with a list of pain points we had heard from various research studies, customer support, reviews, and areas the product analytics showed we were failing. We asked people to rank the pain points (and add whatever we missed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This survey came back, and there were clear &amp;quot;winners&amp;quot; for major pain points. However, we still didn&amp;#39;t know why these areas were causing issues. So I then scheduled interviews with 12 customers to get additional context into the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;. My qualitative research was focused, and the outcome allowed us to fix the problems with a user-centric mindset. No guessing what was wrong and why; we had the data we needed to make impactful change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Convergent parallel design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, convergent parallel design collects qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously and independently. Both data types carry the same weight, are analyzed separately, and then compared or combined to cross-validate your findings. For me, this approach is the more challenging of the three and the one I&amp;#39;ve used the least. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One (rare) example of using this approach was when we were studying behavior and attitude simultaneously. We wanted to learn about interactive media in  research academics&amp;#39; papers and how that impacted their publishing rates. We collected the publishing rates data and held 1x1 interviews to understand academic perceptions of interactive media in articles. Comparing the qualitative and quantitative results was challenging, but we had a shorter timeline and needed insights quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to use mixed methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I receive or create a &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;double-barrelled&amp;quot; research question, I use mixed methods research. What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How questions typically include both qualitative and quantitative aspects. For instance, I have used mixed methods to answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does GenZ perceive (qualitative) fashion trends, and to what extent does that impact their shopping behavior (quantitative)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the major pain points (quantitative), and how are they impacting people&amp;#39;s perceptions of our website (qualitative)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do research academics think about (qualitative) interactive media in their articles, and how does this impact their publishing frequency (quantitative)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do employee performance ratings (quantitative) impact employees&amp;#39; perceived job satisfaction (qualitative)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the goals of a mixed methods research study can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the full context behind what people are experiencing or people&amp;#39;s behavior (quantitative) and why (qualitative)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalizing insights to a larger population &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having uncertainty of where to start with qualitative user research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising the validity and reliability of your research results through triangulation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing large amounts of qualitative data &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to expect from mixed methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixed methods can take your user research to the next level by lending more credibility to your insights, allowing you to prioritize and generalize to a larger population, and giving your qualitative research focus. 

However, with these positives, mixed methods can be highly complex work. Taking in different data types and comparing the results is time-intensive. Whenever I have done mixed methods, it has added to the timeline (except for convergent parallel design), and I needed a quantitative counterpart to support my analysis. There were also times when the quantitative and qualitative data guided us to completely dissonant conclusions, which is frustrating after spending so much time and effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with all these caveats, mixed methods is a fantastic approach to user research. Therefore, we need to focus on mixed methods research more in the future, either by increasing our skills or having qualitative and quantitative researchers work together more closely. Not only does it give us a holistic picture of our users, but it deepens our knowledge and allows for an even higher degree of user-centric thinking in our organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

They weren’t the nicest—as I quickly found out design is not where my skill sets lie—but they did the job. Consequently, since I was the only researcher, I also tested my work. So I used to start my usability tests, saying, “We want to get your feedback on some designs I made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I uttered that fateful sentence, the test was doomed. Participants bloomed into people who just wanted to give me praise or &lt;i&gt;uh-huh-&lt;/i&gt;ed and &lt;i&gt;umm-ed &lt;/i&gt;throughout my questions. I was stumped and, subsequently, hated running usability tests. Because of this, I could never get deep insights from my projects. I was ashamed of my reports, my number one insight nearly always being: “the participant said it was fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not fine. When the features or ideas went out into the real world, customer success got complaints, or customers didn’t use features. With this, I questioned whether or not I should be a researcher. My findings fell flat, and I felt like I was hurting the team rather than helping them. When I spoke to a research friend about this, they laughed. Admittedly, I was a little hurt, but they explained it to me in three words: social desirability bias. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.theuxblog.com/1bit-of-research-8-overcoming-the-social-desirability-bias-in-ux-research-265738789427&quot;&gt;Social desirability bias&lt;/a&gt; means that we are inclined to act in a way that feels acceptable to society, even if what we do or say is untruthful. How does this relate to testing designs? Well, some participants were more likely to over-report that the designs were “good” or “helpful.” Participants answer in a way that they assume you want to hear. And who wants to hear their designs are bad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, we do! Learning that a prototype is helpful can be nice, but we need to focus on where we can improve. We need to uncover the things that are going wrong so we can iterate on and fix them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do we combat social desirability bias?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a designer, you will likely have to test your designs at one point, which means you will likely encounter social desirability bias. However, there are quite a few ways to negate this effect and still get good results without participants concerning themselves with hurting your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Distance yourself from the designs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can avoid it, try not to test your designs, ensuring a more neutral session moderation. It is much easier for someone to test something they didn’t create. That way, you can also truthfully tell the participant the most crucial line in the introduction: “I didn’t design this, so you absolutely won’t hurt my feelings. We want you to be as honest and open with feedback as possible because that is the only way we can improve!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some other pieces to include in your introduction and throughout the episode are:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminding the participant that you are looking for constructive feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telling them that they are the expert and you are here to learn from them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying that these are just a few ideas the team came up with, but nothing is set in stone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stating that the team loves it when people don’t like something, as it helps them improve &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t get around this and must test your designs, you can tell &lt;i&gt;a little white lie&lt;/i&gt;. For example, when I told participants that my designs weren’t actually mine, they were more likely to share constructive feedback. I kept this up, and it was one of the best small changes I made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Build rapport&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the time at the beginning of the session to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-skills/&quot;&gt;build rapport with your participant&lt;/a&gt;. I always begin with a warm-up where I ask the participant general questions such as, “What is your favorite hobby?” or “how do you like to spend your free time?” or “anything interesting that you’ve read or watched recently?” When they answer, I don’t just say thanks and move on; I follow up on the answers. Spending this time together allows the participant to trust me more and engage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let go of what you want&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever we have a result we want to get to, we can ask leading or biased questions. So, for example, if we want the participants to say a particular thing, complete a specific action, or give a certain type of feedback, we might end up leading them there. Therefore, it is essential to let go of what you want from the research session and focus on the participant’s thoughts and reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we need to know our biases and also write open-ended questions in our discussion guide to prompt us. I become more aware of my biases by writing all of them down before my session. For example, I will list everything I think will happen and want to happen during the session. This list can include things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the participant will not find value in the concept&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the participant will understand our prototype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-skills/&quot;&gt;I always write open-ended questions&lt;/a&gt; in my discussion guide. These questions remind me that I need to be as neutral and unbiased as possible. I use the acronym TEDW to frame most of my questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T stands for “Tell me about the last time...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E means “Explain the last time...” or “Explain what you mean by...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;D signifies “Describe how you feel about...” or “Describe what you mean by...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;W stands for “Walk me through...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Explain what you mean by...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a participant say, “it’s fine” or “it’s good?” Having this happen is probably the most frustrating part of usability testing. It can be so disheartening when your participant won’t give you anything substantial. This situation is a great time to use your TEDW acronym to dig into what participants mean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whenever participants use a subjective and vague word like “helpful” or “fine,” you can ask:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Explain what you mean by ‘fine.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Describe what you mean by ‘helpful.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions will force (in a good way!) the participant to think about and better articulate how they feel. I sometimes apologize ahead of time by saying, “I’m really sorry if I keep asking you what you mean, but I am trying to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ask indirect questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When nothing else is working, I go to my indirect questions. These questions give the participant the freedom to answer the question without it relating to them. If they have problems giving constructive feedback due to social desirability bias or other reasons, they may have an easier time talking about how it might impact someone else badly. So, for example, you can ask, “how would this impact your friend/family member/colleague?” or, “what would your friend/family member/colleague think about this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When relevant, use stimuli&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your designs are about a complex or emotionally loaded topic or talking to a challenging population (e.g., kids), you can use stimuli. For example, when I was helping a company design an end-of-life care website, we used different stimuli to help people explain their feelings. For this study, we brought in photos representing emotions and used notecards with emotions written on them that people could use to describe their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, one of the most critical parts of getting constructive feedback from your participants is being aware. If you are aware of your biases and are open to feedback, you will be more likely to ask questions that get this type of feedback. Keep these tips in mind next time you need to test designs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;

Whether you’re looking for a fast signal or conducting in-depth generative research, we want Dovetail to accommodate your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, it was a no-brainer to launch views—five new ways to visualize your data with the flexibility to fit your research process. Views gives you total control over every aspect of your research content: notes, highlights, and insights. It’s totally customizable, meaning you can decide what you want to see and how you want to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Canvas view—affinity at your fingertips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canvas is an affinity mapping tool that revolutionizes how you synthesize your data. Built with collaboration in mind, your team can cluster highlights, discover themes, and refine your findings in real-time. Many traditional affinity mapping tools are general-purpose and break the connection between your raw data and insights, damaging credibility and impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bid farewell to generic tools and cumbersome spreadsheets; canvas view lets you find themes and patterns directly in Dovetail. Your affinity maps are no longer static artifacts—they become living labs where you can play around with your data in an unstructured way. And while there are lots of reasons to be excited about this new addition, we want to focus on one in particular: it lets you get from raw data directly to insight faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, we’ve introduced smart arrange. Need to make sense of an overwhelming set of highlights and quickly cluster them for synthesis? Smart arrange will group them for you automatically by tag or note. Looking for a specific set of highlights in the middle of a cluster? No problem—you can filter to get to the good stuff and see the highlights, tags, or fields that matter most. Canvas is just one of the ways we’re reimagining how people use Dovetail to find the answers they need and make better decisions faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/projects&quot;&gt;Get started with canvas now →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Board, table, grid, and list—visualize your data your way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affinity mapping is just the start! We’re rolling out four more views to use in your research: board, table, grid, and list. If you’re familiar with Notion or Airtable, you’ll catch on to these quickly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like canvas, these new views work with notes, highlights, and insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Board &lt;/b&gt;→ Structure, segment, and aggregate data flexibly—group by fields like persona, behavior, or demographic. Visually curate and prioritize insights for stakeholders and decision-makers.  Map the customer journey from awareness to advocacy, or just use them to track the status of your interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table&lt;/b&gt; → Make the most of your research with all your data visible at once. View and edit information at a glance. Quickly structure data with fields to simplify filtering, sorting, and grouping, or easily edit tags on individual highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grid &lt;/b&gt;→ Browsing your data never looked so good. Grid’s beautiful design is the perfect way to present insights or add notes where a structure isn’t needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;List&lt;/b&gt; →  A view for the minimalists; list keeps things simple—create a list of research documents, add notes quickly, or stack rank and prioritize insights to give stakeholders a focused view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is only just scratching the surface with all the fantastic things you can do with views. To kickstart your research, we’ve created some out-of-the-box templates for you to use. Be it empathy mapping, persona creation, JTBD, or analyzing ongoing feedback across multiple sources, we’ve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think this new feature will make it easier and faster to analyze, synthesize, and create insights in one place. As a reminder, Views will be rolling out in stages to all current Dovetail customers, so you should see it in your workspace by March 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, we’d love to hear what you think.

As is the case for the UX research field in general, UX research managers come from different backgrounds, and previous management experience eases a transition into this role. If you’ve been hired as the first lead or manager in a company or are building a team from scratch, you’ll be responsible for creating&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-grow-ux-research-team/&quot;&gt; a vision and hiring strategy&lt;/a&gt; and growing the team with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But growing a team yourself may not be the situation you encounter. It could be that you are inheriting a team already in place. The team might be relatively new, but it will have its strengths, weaknesses, and an existing dynamic—one that emerged before you were in the picture. It is in your best interest to understand these dynamics as early as possible and approach your leadership role with a firm understanding of the history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent 18 years in management roles, first in a university where I managed large lecture courses and graduate student research projects. Then in UX, I first built my own team of UX researchers and service designers and later inherited an existing team. This last challenge—inheriting an existing team—is the focus of this article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start the process of interviewing for such a role, come up with a plan. If you have a background in research, you are well equipped to define the “problem space”—the one you are being hired to improve and grow. There are important considerations to keep in mind at three stages: While you are interviewing for the role, during your first 30 days in the role, and the long-term leadership you bring to the role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Interview stage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates often approach a job interview like its sole purpose is to evaluate their fit for a role. But it’s also about determining whether the role is a good fit for you. This means gathering as much information as possible in the hours you have with these individuals before you decide whether to take on the role. At this moment, assess whether you see this role as an exciting challenge or one that’s raising red flags. The interview process &lt;i&gt;should ensure that you meet your future manager, your reports, and a selection of key stakeholders&lt;/i&gt;, so participants on both sides can get a good idea of compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Find out who is currently managing the team&lt;/i&gt;. It could be this person has left the organization or has moved to another role. Or, this person is going to be your manager and is moving up the food chain or will be managing a smaller number of reports. If possible, ask them about their experience managing the team. How do they describe the individuals on the team? How did they assess performance? Have they helped the team actively improve their craft or stakeholder management skills? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are still a candidate, so this information will necessarily remain somewhat abstract. Do your best to get a good idea of what—manager to manager—leading this team is like and what tools are in place to assess performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meet your future team, and assess their expertise and existing views toward management&lt;/i&gt;. Ensure you have time to ask about each team member’s background, strong points, and how they want to grow professionally in the interview. Get an idea of how they have experienced management. Are they used to being included in decision-making? Do they have a clear idea of how they can move forward at this company? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use your first 30 days wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you’ve decided to take the plunge! Establish a routine and spend quality time with your team from day one, both individually and all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assess existing team culture. &lt;/i&gt;How often is your team used to meeting? How does your team work on research projects—do they go in solo or pair up? Were they leading the work themselves? Who decided which projects to prioritize? Dive deeper into your team’s strengths and weaknesses, both on a team and individual level, and start to understand how things have worked for them and where they can improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dive deep with the former manager, if possible. Listen to their assessment of each team member’s skill level. Have a look at past evaluations. Do you see challenges that may be looming? For those who might be struggling, how has this been addressed? For those excelling in their role, are they on a clear promotion track? If the former manager is unable or unwilling to share these details, ask why. Now is the time to be direct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grow a solid relationship with your own manager&lt;/i&gt;. Your manager is in a senior management role managing managers and will need to ensure your time together is divided between catching up on your team’s challenges and focusing on your own career development. Make sure to clarify what your managers’ expectations are. For example, are you responsible for roadmap planning? What are the deadlines for this, and who do you need to include in this process? What are your management responsibilities? How will your team’s performance be evaluated, and what is your role in this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Become an expert on HR policies&lt;/i&gt;. How do your reports request access to software? How do they report illness or request a holiday? Most likely, it will be your responsibility to approve these requests, so make sure you know what’s expected of you. How are you expected to evaluate your team members, and when? What if you run into problems with one of your reports—what are the necessary training or disciplinary procedures? It’s better to know how all of these administrative responsibilities work &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; you find yourself in a situation that requires quick action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long-term leadership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, you’re still the new kid on the block, but you’ve settled into your role. You know where the vital Slack channels are, and you’ve met and interviewed your most important stakeholders. Most crucially, you’ve begun to build a relationship with your team members. Perhaps you’re already gearing up to expand the team, where you will act as hiring manager. There’s plenty to consider in the long term, but here are a couple of points to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prepare yourself to make tough calls&lt;/i&gt;. It could be that one of your reports isn’t performing the way they should for the level they’re at. Or they’re unhappy with their role for another reason and are not improving despite your intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting people go will lead to challenges with your team and broader stakeholders. This is a difficult part of being a manager. If you have built a strong relationship with your own manager, they should support you. And because you took the time to get to know HR procedures, you’ll know how to proceed if you need to let someone go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most importantly, always try to &lt;i&gt;be a humble boss&lt;/i&gt;. Inheriting an existing team can be intimidating. You are the new kid on the block, but you are also the manager. You’ll need to strike the right balance between learning the ropes and taking the helm. Any changes you decide to implement, do so with a clear understanding of the team’s history. Change for the sake of change or as a way to assert authority will probably not be well-received. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always be honest about how you’re feeling. If you don’t know something, don’t be afraid to ask. Be open to feedback and admitting you’re wrong. If you can demonstrate humble yet decisive leadership, your team will be your greatest asset for success in this role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Janelle Ward, Principal Consultant, Janelle Ward Insights. &lt;/b&gt;Janelle has led UX research at digital product companies, both as a founding lead and as a manager upskilling and growing existing research teams.

Acting as a hiring manager is a solemn duty. Candidates will dedicate hours of their time to a recruitment process. At the end of a successful process, you will invite someone to join your organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they come on board, they will devote a large percentage of their waking hours contributing to your team. Further, they will potentially move across the country or even the world to do it, bringing their families, pets, and furniture with them. In essence, they will change their lives for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You understand the gravitas of the circumstance, so you’ve prepared well for the process. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-grow-ux-research-team/&quot;&gt;As I covered last time&lt;/a&gt;, you have a UX research vision and a well-thought-out strategy for hiring. You’ve done the work of defining which researchers you need and which profile of researcher you want to attract first. Now it’s time to move onto some practical steps in growing your team: writing the job description and planning your interview process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method in Madness has &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/prepare-uxr-interview-hiring-manager/&quot;&gt;a great article&lt;/a&gt; that details job descriptions and interview structure, process, and evaluation. This article takes a slightly different focus: connecting your hiring strategy with your job description and an important relationship to nurture throughout the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Craft the role and the expectations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is crafting a meaningful job description. The job description, the one you will push out into the digital world, is the first impression you make on potential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ensure the role fits with the vision and strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes beyond where the researcher will focus or what expertise they will bring to the team. It should be clear to you, and also to your stakeholders, how this person directly connects to your strategy. This benefits not only you, but it also benefits your potential new team member: If they know how their role fits into a broader strategy, and where and how they can grow at your organization, it only increases the likelihood they’ll stick around to develop themselves along with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be clear about what the role entails&lt;/i&gt;. Sharp candidates will quickly pick up on an “impossible to fulfill” role that, for example, involves leading research solo for multiple product teams and also responsibilities for setting up research operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provide as much transparency as you can&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;State, for example, to whom the researcher will report. You don’t have to give your name, but you could mention your title. Upfront knowledge about reporting lines could be valuable for candidates. How will the researcher be situated within the organization? Do you know if the researcher will be embedded in a particular product team? Are you opening a vacancy for several roles and plan to slot chosen candidates where they fit best? Sharing this information gives candidates a clear idea of the landscape of the team they are considering joining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Share your genuine enthusiasm for the role&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes you excited about bringing this new person on board? Think back to your vision and strategy and think of the teamwork necessary to achieve it. Include a few sentences from the heart, ones that demonstrate your excitement for your future colleague and the great addition they will be to the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plan your interview process in collaboration with recruitment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you’re writing the job description, in tandem you’ll be identifying who will participate in the interview process. Method in Madness’s&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/prepare-uxr-interview-hiring-manager/&quot;&gt; other article&lt;/a&gt; on this topic provides excellent tips about how to structure a UX research interview and how to score candidates fairly, particularly in assessing UX research expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it will most likely be your responsibility to craft the job description, hiring never happens in isolation. You will need to collaborate with your candidate’s future stakeholders, keep them up to speed on your hiring procedures, and get their enthusiastic participation in the interviewing process. There is another internal relationship to foster during this period, namely, one with the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you work for a company without an internal or external recruitment team, you will most likely be relying on a recruitment specialist to get your new hire vetted and onboarded. Early on, meet and build a good relationship with the recruiter you’ll work with. This relationship is crucial in hiring-heavy times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first things to cover with your recruiter is to discuss expectations about how the hiring process will proceed. Recruiters are experts on hiring new employees—this is what they do all day, every day. Defer to their expertise: ask them to describe how they usually collaborate with hiring managers. If recruitment is a well-oiled machine, this process could be sufficient as is. However, it could be that you have different preferences about the process, and it’s important to discuss these preferences before the job description is posted and candidates start rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond clarifying the process as to how you will handle the candidate pool, scheduling interviews, and the like, here are a few aspects to consider with your recruiter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the recruiter is assessing cultural fit, what exactly are they looking for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the recruiter is assessing role fit, what questions should they ask and what responses are preferable for the role?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the recruiter be sourcing candidates for the role? What specific criteria would you like them to search for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the recruiter comprehensively cover all practical aspects in their initial call with the candidate? What are the salary requirements for the role, and what is the recruiter’s approach to asking candidates for their requirements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will save a lot of time by ensuring the candidates in the pipeline would be happy to accept the role given the conditions initially presented to them by the recruiter. This isn’t just about salary: It also relates to length of contract, relocation perks, and work from home policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The star of the show: the candidate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final thought: The hiring process is a two-way street. A candidate has applied and is being interviewed for a job you posted, but they are not only there to be chosen. They must also choose you. The interview process is the chance for a candidate to assess you and their potential future stakeholders for a good fit. It doesn’t hurt to emphasize this when you first meet your future teammate. And, it goes without saying: Always, at every stage of the process, leave time for them to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Janelle Ward, Principal Consultant, Janelle Ward Insights. &lt;/b&gt;Janelle has led UX research at digital product companies, both as a founding lead and as a manager upskilling and growing existing research teams.

Or where your company stands in terms of how you are currently using user research? Or, most importantly, what level are you on and how to get to the &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; level of user research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think about this all the time. Processes, frameworks, and how I am was running user research at an organization would keep me up at night. Was I doing it right? How did I compare to others? It felt like there was no framework available to benchmark my work to bring user research into an organization. Fortunately, a few years back, I attended a meetup about the concept of UXR Maturity models. It was that exact framework I was looking for, and I scrambled to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few tries (and lots of Googling), I found several examples online to use as a jumping-off point. Since then, I have used UXR Maturity models at every organization and shared them widely with my students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is UX Maturity?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX maturity is as it sounds: essentially, it’s how mature your organization is when dealing with UX and user research practices. You can assess maturity at a broader UX level or focus on user research maturity. I recommend doing both! Fortunately, some researchers have dived into this space and created wonderful resources for us to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UX maturity model enables an individual to accomplish what I mentioned above: assess how mature a company is with their user research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, UX maturity models are a guide in understanding the purpose of user research in a company, whether it is non-existent, a tool to validate design decisions, a way to discover new insights, a method to innovate, or a combination of the above (the good ones, usually). A model like this gives you a clear framework, allowing you to understand where you currently lie on the UXR maturity scale and what you have to do to get to the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, the more mature a company is, the &lt;i&gt;easier&lt;/i&gt; it should be to include user research in an organization’s processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can assessing UX maturity do for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing where your company currently lies within a UXR maturity model is essential for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obtain a greater understanding of how much buy-in user research currently has in your organization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You acquire action items for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ux/ux-researcher/&quot;&gt;what you need to do as a user researcher&lt;/a&gt; to move the company in a more user-centric direction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helps gain buy-in by approaching user research in the most appropriate way for &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;organization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answers questions like, “Am I doing this right?” or “what do I do next?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was first assessing UXR maturity at my organization, it forced me to take a step back. Yes, I wanted to do advanced generative research on complex topics, but were we at a point to do that? What else did I have to put into place first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of rushing ahead with impatience, I carefully considered the foundation I had to lay to make us successful in the future. The exercise was eye-opening, and I’ve used it ever since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to assess UXR maturity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX maturity models tend to have five or six different levels, depending on the resource. Here are the most common hierarchies of UX research maturity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absence/Unawareness of UX Research: The organization is unaware of user research and the value of conducting research. There is an absence of processes and movement in user research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX Research Awareness—Ad Hoc Research: The organization is aware of user research but misunderstands the purpose. It is often used as a tool to validate changes or to “make something look pretty.” Frequently, there will be ad hoc research requests that come very late in the pipeline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption of UX research into projects: User research comes into projects earlier than in stage two and starts to become part of whatever development cycle the team is using (e.g., agile)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maturing UX research into an organizational focus: User research becomes part of the organizational process. Teams and stakeholders are bought in and conduct research whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated UX research across strategy: Instead of informing or validating minor aesthetic changes, user research informs product strategy, as well as other strategies across the organization (e.g., marketing, account management, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete UX research culture—What every user researcher wants their organization to be: the entire company is research-centric and driven by a need to understand users. UX is an integral part of the organization’s thinking process at every level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many models available to use, such as the one below, used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://inside.getyourguide.com/blog/2018/1/17/10-learnings-on-maturing-ux&quot;&gt;GetYourGuide&lt;/a&gt;. This model is a great way to get started in determining, at a high level, where the UX maturity lies at your organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get this overview of the UX maturity, you can dive in a little deeper, using this more detailed model by &lt;a href=&quot;http://vitor.io/evangelizing-user-research-enterprise&quot;&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This maturity model can end up looking more like a bingo board, with some areas that may be more mature than others, which is why I love it and have used it at previous companies. I identified our overall maturity using the first model, but I knew Nasdaq’s model would work better because we were further along in some areas than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UX Maturity Model: from A to B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing this model, I broke down the hurdles and opportunity areas into three areas: operational, organizational, and strategic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Operational hurdles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal&lt;/b&gt;: Improve day-to-day user research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No external testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long recruitment process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No easy GDPR consent tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few tools for scheduling, recruitment, synthesis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No concept of UX data tracking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Organizational hurdles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal&lt;/b&gt;: Ingrain user research into the organization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little understanding of user research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX (and user research) siloed from the organization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little leadership buy-in (e.g., takes too long, costs too much)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No shared concepts and understanding of users (e.g., personas, journey maps)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategic hurdles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal&lt;/b&gt;: Move from tactical user research to influencing product strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No discovery research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No prioritization from senior leadership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided on the following steps to advance the user research maturity at the organization:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move into the direction of discovery research—I ran generative research studies regularly, but there was a lot more work I needed to do in terms of education and how to work alongside our squads with this discovery research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start beta and pilot programs as soon as we have new concepts applicable to these types of methodologies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversify our methodologies to more easily collect data (e.g., include unmoderated testing to speed up feedback-gathering)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase our data collection and analytics game regarding user research metrics (such as time on task, task success)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create outputs that foster shared understanding throughout the team, such as personas, user journeys, user scenarios, comic storyboards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure I integrate research throughout all the different departments (e.g., marketing, customer support)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on creating more frameworks and processes across user research, especially in our agile development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately got to work on these specific action items and kept the hurdles in the back of my mind. Finally, after a year of steady progress, I updated our maturity map: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I already had an idea that this was the necessary work to level up user research, it was undoubtedly helpful to map out where we currently were on a pre-defined model, where I could easily see the next steps. Especially in times of confusion or when you hit the “what do I fix next” wall, UXR maturity models are a crucial partner for getting you clarity and inciting action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;

You’ve been given the green light to build your UX research team. Whether you plan to expand your team by one or ten, this is an important moment that shows your company’s commitment to insights-driven decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be a solo UX researcher who’s convinced leadership to dive head-first into a research investment. You might be a design, insights, or product leader who will be spearheading the growth. Whatever your background, if it’s your first time taking on this challenge, you’re probably wondering where to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might want to dive into posting a vacancy. Perhaps you’re already thinking about who in your network might be able to help spread the word. To successfully grow a UX research team, consider crafting a vision and outlining a hiring strategy as crucial first steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Crafting a long-term UX research vision&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in growing a successful UX research team is to craft a vision for UX research. In a nutshell, a vision encompasses goals you have for the future. Creating a vision means having the ability to imagine something that does not yet exist—to visualize the UX research practice, several years from now, in its most desirable form. This is not something that you create in isolation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To craft a vision, you’ll need to look &lt;i&gt;inward&lt;/i&gt;, to understand the existing company mindset toward users and insights-driven decision making, and &lt;i&gt;outward&lt;/i&gt;, to recognize the ideal experience users could have with your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been a practicing UX researcher for any amount of time, you learned early on that your responsibility isn’t just understanding your company’s users. It’s also understanding the users of your insights. Those users are company leaders who are in a position to digest and adopt research insights in their business decisions. To ensure the vitality of the team you are about to grow, you need to appreciate what will work for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: &lt;i&gt;looking inward to understand leadership’s mindset toward user insights* is as important as understanding your users. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also vital to &lt;i&gt;look outward&lt;/i&gt;, which means becoming an expert on existing user research within your company. If you have researchers, designers, or others who have conducted UX research on your team, interview them, too. This process will help you articulate what the ideal experience could look like for users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Craft a UX Research Vision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a solid understanding of your key stakeholder’s views toward UX research and you feel confident about what you know (or what you don’t know) about the users, it’s time to create a vision. As you write, embrace this opportunity to advocate for your users. Remember: Your vision needs to consider the perspective of your stakeholders, who will often be business-oriented: they want growth, they want success, and these goals may not necessarily be fully oriented toward research insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s essential to find a balance between acknowledging business goals to get leadership buy-in and pushing leadership thinking forward in order to grow a more insights-driven organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create a hiring strategy for growing your UX research team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve created a UX research vision and shared it with key stakeholders. You’ve iterated on the content and structure with their feedback. Now it’s time to think about how you will get there—what strategic steps are necessary to make that vision happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ux/ux-research-methods/&quot;&gt;UX research strategy&lt;/a&gt; can refer to many different things. For example: how best to advocate for your insights internally, how to create a user participant pool for research, or how to grow a culture of excellence as your team expands. Here, the focus is on a UX research strategy for growing your team, in other words, &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; you’ll need to get on the team to make your vision become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like vision, you should create strategy through involving the appropriate stakeholders. It’s also vital to continuously refer back to your vision and the ideal state toward which you want your UX research practice to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example of how to tie strategy and vision to a hiring plan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which product areas of your company need the input of UX researchers? Do you want to expand stakeholders’ appetite for qualitative discovery research? Finding researchers with solid ethnographic and qualitative backgrounds in generative research is a must. Does your company have an analytics-heavy orientation? Do stakeholders need to be taking into account more qualitative insights? Mixed methods researchers who can seamlessly communicate with their data expert counterparts could be a good idea. Does your company have a strong market research team? Bringing in a quantitative UX researcher who can provide the user perspective on market research is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What seniority level are you seeking? If your company is already relatively large and you need researchers to come in as professionals independently working with product, tech, and design stakeholders, then it’s better to hire researchers with a corresponding level of experience. If you (or a research colleague) have time and space to mentor incoming researchers closely, consider hiring those at a junior level. You’ll also want to build Research Operations so UX research practice can become a finely tuned machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will researchers be situated within the organization? This may not be your decision, but it’s important to consider whether researchers are embedded in product teams or are more centrally located before hiring can begin.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget about more practical aspects of your hiring strategy: How fast can you grow the team? What is possible from a budgetary perspective? If you are managing in addition to conducting research, what is the optimal rate at which you can hire and onboard new team members, ensuring you can give each person enough time to feel comfortable in their role, with a responsive manager at their side to guide them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind—especially in the rapidly scaling tech world—companies can quickly change. Vision and strategy are not things to create and put on a shelf. You will need to revisit them regularly to ensure they stay relevant to your company’s current culture and current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a solid UX research vision and UX research hiring strategy in place, you can draw on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/prepare-uxr-interview-hiring-manager/&quot;&gt;to write the job description—the first communication you will have with your future team members—and prepare your interviewing process.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Now you can store, reference, and share all of your files in Dovetail!]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/introducing-files-in-dovetail</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/introducing-files-in-dovetail</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Customer knowledge is often distributed across an organization, hiding in little presentations over here and pdfs over there.

I remember the first time I started shadowing hiring managers in job interviews. Although I was well-versed in asking good questions, it was a whole other ball game. The interviewer carefully crafted and selected the best questions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-ux-researcher-interview/&quot;&gt;help us assess the candidate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never had I had to assess someone through question-asking. I was okay with having open-ended conversations or evaluating a prototype, but not another human. What if I made the wrong choice? Asked the wrong questions? Hurt the candidate’s view of the company? My first solo job interview as a hiring manager was terrifying, and I think I was more nervous than the person I was interviewing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have sat in and conducted hundreds of job interviews (and been a candidate for just as many). Over time, I have collected ways to mitigate this stress for myself and the candidate, making it a better experience for us both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prep for the interview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting people is challenging—both users and potential employees! When you are looking for a new person to join your team, the to-do list can feel endless. Between reaching out, posting, fielding applications, scrolling through portfolios, and scheduling interviews, you can already feel burnt out by the time you get around to talking to candidates. So here are ways I prep ahead of time to streamline the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Write a great job description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with the job description that people read. But, if your job description is too vague or the responsibilities are unclear, you might get applications that don’t make sense. So, how do you write a job description that brings you the right candidates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When beginning to write job descriptions, I first did desk research. I went through many job descriptions from other companies and picked out what stood out as most impactful and what I didn’t like. Then, I piled examples into these two categories until I felt like I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming/&quot;&gt;the same themes repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; (hey, user research!). After that, I started to craft my job description. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here is an example of what I include in job descriptions&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct both generative and evaluative research using various methods to collect and analyze users’ behavior, such as usability testing, surveys, interviews, diary studies, and card sorting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collect information from different teams (e.g., product, account management, customer success, sales, marketing, tech) to understand assumptions about users and current gaps in knowledge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proactively work with teams (e.g., product, account management, customer success, sales, marketing, tech) &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/share-insights-stick/&quot;&gt;to share insights&lt;/a&gt; and deliverables through collaborative synthesis, presentations, and workshops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assist teams in turning research into real, actionable ideas through ideation workshops, helping them to develop user-centric prototypes, wireframes, and experiences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritize the most impactful research to teams, the business, and our users by balancing research requests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn business questions and goals into viable research studies that deliver value to the company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify new, innovative product or feature areas for the company through research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Execute the end-to-end research process, including planning, scoping, recruiting, conducting, analyzing, and sharing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to help scale the research team and set up a foundation for the company to grow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, different levels require different job posts, so keep that in mind when writing requirements. These bullet points are meant to &lt;i&gt;entice&lt;/i&gt; people to join the company. Through this job description, you want people to understand what you need from them and be excited by your opportunities. Try to avoid generic bullet points that don’t explain your expectations. Get creative!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Decide on the structure for the process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the worst experiences for a candidate is a confusing or ambiguous interview process. Not predetermining the different steps you want the candidate to go through is more work for you. By deciding on a structure early on, you are setting yourself and the candidate up for success. You can let them know what they should expect from each interview stage and reduce miscommunication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most companies have similar interview processes, so no need to reinvent the wheel. Here are is a sample interview process I have set up at a previous company:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening call with HR or the recruiter where you get to know the candidate and ask general skill-based questions—30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep dive interview with another researcher/designer/product manager (depending on your team set-up) where the candidate presents one or two case studies to better assess their skills—60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panel interview with several team members or close working colleagues where the candidate presents (usually the same) case study to a group of people they would be working with. In this interview, you are further assessing their skills and understanding their collaboration skills —60 to 90 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whiteboard challenge or a homework assignment is a way to understand how a candidate approaches a problem by giving them an assignment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Whiteboard Challenge is usually live, where the person has a few minutes to think about the problem you gave them and is then working through their approach with you—45 to 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A homework assignment is where you send the assignment to the candidate, and then they create a presentation they share in another interview (or during the panel interview)—five working days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interview with their manager where you ask them more questions about their skills and assess knowledge level, as well as culture fit—60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final HR or recruitment call that is all about an offer (or rejection), talking about contracts, salaries, and start dates—30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can shorten (or even lengthen) this process to whatever fits your organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Build a challenge or homework assignment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To challenge or not to challenge? That is the question! Many companies took the UX design whiteboard challenge to apply it to the user research job process. There are two main ways to incorporate this step into your interview process:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whiteboard challenge&lt;/b&gt;. The whiteboard challenge is when you invite the candidate in for an interview and give them a problem to solve with you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Homework assignment&lt;/b&gt;. The homework assignment is when you send a problem to the candidate to solve on time and later present it to you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of these challenges, not because they are scary and complex, but because they can genuinely reveal how a researcher would approach a problem at your organization. I prefer the whiteboard challenge because I love to have these discussions live with research candidates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming up with these challenges can be…well, &lt;i&gt;challenging&lt;/i&gt;. I always try to make them relevant to our organization or industry rather than picking a random problem and context. When coming up with a problem, think about similar issues &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; or other researchers in the organization have faced. Sometimes, it is fun to use a problem you tackled in the past to see how others would approach it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of whiteboard challenges and homework assignments I have used in the past:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We just noticed that many users signed up on our app and then quickly left. How would you determine why they left and how to get them back?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have just launched a new subscription offer that allows people to make orders and returns more quickly and get alerted to sales early. The team wants to know what new features they should create to get new customers. How would you design this study?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your team has approached you with a list of research questions they need to answer in about five weeks. The questions include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do users navigate through our app?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do our filters provide value for our users? Or what would they prefer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do users perceive our homepage? Is it helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do users download our app?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consider a scorecard &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, I didn’t standardize what I was looking for in a candidate or the assessment process. Instead, I took each candidate and assessed them independently, having the general criteria in my mind. Although this was an okay way of approaching assessment, I was more likely to make mistakes or forget to look at particular criteria. Not having a standard approach made it more difficult to ensure I asked the questions I needed to assess the candidates equally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some time, I created a job scorecard that was the same for each candidate. Check out this scorecard template you can use in your own interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give candidates a chance to ask questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the amount of time, it is always important to reserve time for the candidate to ask you questions during an interview. There are a few reasons this is necessary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows them to properly assess you and make a more informed decision on if they want to move forward in the process and if your company is a good fit for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use these questions to understand how the candidate is thinking—for example, if candidates ask about org structure or where research requests come from, I get a better sense that they will think about this in their role. Alternatively, if a candidate doesn’t ask questions, it sends up a bit of a red flag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving candidates the chance to ask questions make the experience better for them. One of my biggest pet peeves is when I have an interview with a company, and I don’t have the opportunity to ask any questions. It can make me feel like they don’t care about my side of the experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If hiring is more fun for you, it will be more fun for the candidate. The clearer you can be with what you need and expect from candidates, the more smoothly the process will go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

Vlad Magdalin (CEO of Webflow), Stewart Butterfield (CEO of Slack), and Daniel Yanisse (CEO of Checkr) have also joined our investor and advisor group. &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vp9pg2QXtMIlS5zPUJrY2brmQYxI-UsI/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Read the full press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working on Dovetail for almost five years. It’s hard to believe that not long ago, we were working together on our own trying to find product-market fit and solving the complex challenges of qualitative data analysis. Back then, our goal was to earn enough recurring revenue to afford rent and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/&quot;&gt;fantastic team&lt;/a&gt; of 65 people across our offices in Sydney and San Francisco who support more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/customers/&quot;&gt;2,600 wonderful customers&lt;/a&gt;. This funding brings our valuation north of $700M USD which emphasizes the importance of this emerging category and the exciting future ahead for customer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new friends at Accel are no stranger to backing product-led, B2B SaaS companies. They’ve invested in many innovative companies over 35-plus years, including 1Password, Atlassian, Checkr, Slack, Spotify, Squarespace, and Webflow. Accel is also known for investing in international companies like us that are based outside of the Bay Area—Rich led Atlassian’s Series A in 2010 and has a long history with them. These factors, plus the relationship we built up with Rich and Arun through 2021, made Accel an obvious choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we explain what we’re doing with the extra capital, we’d like to thank our community, customers, existing investors, friends, family, and our team who have made all of this possible. We still have a lot of work to achieve our vision, but we wouldn’t be writing this blog without your continued help and support!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evolving our product&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve always believed that deep customer understanding helps to create the best products and services. With the rise of cloud apps, we know that teams now have access to more qualitative and quantitative customer data than ever before. However, this surge in the volume of data, the variety of formats, and the fragmentation across tools makes it tricky to quickly gain insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, our customers are at the heart of everything we do. Through our own research, community feedback, and customer conversations, we capture all kinds of customer insights that feed into our decision-making processes. We’ve heard that the demand for customer insights continues to outstrip the capacity of internal research teams. With Dovetail, we feel we have an opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-is-the-democratization-of-user-research/&quot;&gt;‘democratize’ the research process&lt;/a&gt; to help scale research by enabling non-researchers and researchers alike conduct research. But we feel there are many more opportunities beyond analysis: we need to integrate with more tools to support more kinds of data; improve how stakeholders consume research insights; and ultimately change the perception of research by making it cheaper, faster, and more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These challenges are exciting—if we’re successful, we will equip everyone inside an organization access to relevant customer knowledge in seconds, truly deliver a single source of truth for all qualitative and quantitative customer data and insights, and help our customers continue to innovate with competitive and differentiated products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while today Dovetail is the best way for researchers to analyze qualitative data, in 2022, we’ll expand beyond analysis and launch some exciting new products. These will include a product for storing and searching through insights, customer stories, and files; a product for managing research participants and the privacy of their data; and a product for analysis of high-volume data like support tickets, social posts, and in-product feedback. We have some exciting things releasing soon across our analysis and repository offerings that get us closer to this vision. There’s a tonne of detail coming in the next few weeks, but here’s a short teaser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dovetail projects&lt;/b&gt; will soon be reimagined with ‘views’, enabling you to create and save custom views of notes, highlights, and insights displayed as a grid, table, list, board, or even a canvas. Views are very flexible to enable different analysis workflows for different projects. We’ve been working on views for several months and are excited to get it into our customer’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are launching &lt;b&gt;first-class support for files of all types,&lt;/b&gt; allowing you to store, preview, search within, and reference almost any file format right in Dovetail. Currently, you need to add files like Word documents, PDFs, and presentations to a note inside a project. Soon, a file will be its own top-level thing in Dovetail providing better discovery, previewing, and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, expect &lt;b&gt;new integrations&lt;/b&gt; with Slack, Atlassian, Google Drive, and Dropbox. These integrations are designed to make it easier to import data into Dovetail, but also weave customer insights into your existing workflows and tools to build the connection between research and decisions being made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more on these upcoming product releases!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Doing more for our community&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;online community&lt;/a&gt; grew to over 3,500 people across product, design, and research, from all corners of the world. However, we don’t just want our community to be the fastest place to receive product support or provide feedback. We want it to be a place for you to learn, connect, and be challenged about creating impact with customer research within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect more opportunities for you to connect at virtual events (such as the 1,000+ person &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/468BBajtIrI&quot;&gt;tagging taxonomy event&lt;/a&gt; we held in October), in-person meetups (if covid will ever allow it!), and our own conference later in the year, tentatively called Dovecon (our marketing team will come up with something better).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know you’re hungry for more ways to learn about Dovetail best practices. With your help, we will be launching a template gallery, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airtable.com/universe&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/templates/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/miroverse/&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt;, so that you can quickly find and use a project or story template that another Dovetail user has created. Already got a template you’d like to share? Jump into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; and let us know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the opening of our San Francisco office, we will also expand our support coverage to more time zones. This will mean faster response times, particularly for those in the Americas and Europe. We are also growing our Customer Success team that will support our enterprise customers successfully implement, onboard new teams, and ensure Dovetail is helping you at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing our team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, we have been committed to growing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/&quot;&gt;team of world-class people&lt;/a&gt; to build Dovetail. Today, we’re a team of 65 with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/careers/&quot;&gt;plans to hire another 100&lt;/a&gt; in the next year, with 15 to 20 of those to be based in our new San Francisco office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe in-person collaboration is the best way to build high-performing, creative teams, and to make work more than just staring at a screen all day, so our US team will follow an in-person &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/why-we-still-believe-office-culture/&quot;&gt;office culture&lt;/a&gt; like our Sydney office. We’re also proud to continue uniquely Dovetail perks like KitKat days; ad-hoc bonus paid leave for the whole company to take a break and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just impromptu days off and a solid work culture that makes Dovetail great. Every day, we live &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/&quot;&gt;our values&lt;/a&gt; in everything we do. We’re obsessed with enabling teams to make better decisions through customer understanding, and we’re beyond excited to continue this mission across the ocean. To learn more about our values, mission, and our growth plans, visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/careers/&quot;&gt;careers page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you can’t tell, we’ve got a big year planned! We can’t wait to share our new product releases, connect with you at one of our upcoming events, and support you to make customer research a priority within your organization!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to continue to work closely with you to further push the boundaries of product and customer research, and with this funding, we’re confident we can dramatically advance our mission and vision—on our own terms—into this decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to prepare for a UXR job interview as a candidate]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-ux-researcher-interview</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-ux-researcher-interview</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which side you are on in the interview process—a candidate or interviewer—it can be a stressful experience. There is a lot to do to prepare for a user research candidate interview properly. I remember, as a candidate, scrambling to create a portfolio presentation that aligned perfectly with the job description. There were countless times that I felt I missed the mark, the interviews not going as well as I&amp;#39;d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After interviewing for hundreds of positions and being a hiring manager for a few years, I have collected tips to help candidates nail the user research job interview process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prep for your interview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editing your resume, creating portfolio pieces, presenting a case study, doing a challenge, pitching yourself, and remembering to smile during each step—these are just some of the stressful parts of the job interview process. However, job interviews don&amp;#39;t always have to be overwhelming and impossibly difficult. After failing so many (and asking for feedback after!), I have learned the most critical parts of the research job interview process. I still use these tactics whenever I interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Talk about your process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The essential aspect of an interview is articulating &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/streamline-your-user-research-process-in-seven-simple-steps/&quot;&gt;your research process&lt;/a&gt;. As a hiring manager, if I don’t know how you approach problems, I cannot correctly assess your fit into my team. So, what does it mean to explain your research process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I struggled with this concept for a while. At the beginning of my presentation, I used to have a slide that showed ”my process.” But, really, it was just the same as every researcher’s process. Unfortunately, this explanation didn&amp;#39;t help people understand how I approached user research. It was too generic and vague for interviewers to assess my skills properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I quickly learned that explaining my process meant going in-depth and explaining why. As you go through your presentation, it isn&amp;#39;t about telling your audience just &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; you recruited or which method you chose, but &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; you made those decisions. Here’s an example I see happen very often:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the interviews, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-data-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;I synthesized the data into actionable insights&lt;/a&gt; that helped the team make better decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This answer doesn&amp;#39;t work as well because it is simply too vague. As an interviewer, I am thinking of all these questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming/&quot;&gt;How does this person synthesize&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who was involved in the synthesis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this person mean by actionable insights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are some examples of synthesis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are some examples of actionable insights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I might not get the time to follow up with you. Or I might assume because you didn’t explain these answers yourself that you aren&amp;#39;t a good fit. It’s harsh, but it happens! So, let’s try with an answer I have given in the past:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let me take you through my synthesis process. After each interview, I transcribe the interview into excel and start tagging the data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/global-project-tags-taxonomy-research-repository/&quot;&gt;I use a mix of global tags, such as pain points, needs, goals, and project-specific tags related to the research goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this, I do a mini-synthesis session with stakeholders after every five interviews to make the synthesis less overwhelming. We look at each participant during this synthesis session and use the global and project tags to fill in the information. We then look across the participants to see the similarities and cluster similar answers. For example, in this study, we noticed that many participants struggled with food drivers not finding their address, leading to late order arrivals or canceled orders. This pain point was a theme throughout the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would then go into how I take the synthesis and turn it into something the team can digest. So, the interview is not about the insights you learned from the study but about how you approached a problem and conducted a research study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use the STAR method for examples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said above, having concrete examples is critical to nailing your interview. An excellent way to structure your examples is by using the STAR method, as it reminds you of the crucial components to include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Situation&lt;/b&gt;: Give the background and context of the problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Task&lt;/b&gt;: Describe your tasks or responsibilities in the situation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action&lt;/b&gt;: Explain what you did to resolve or address the task&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Result&lt;/b&gt;: Share the impact and outcomes of your actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method, you can &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; your audience what they are looking for: what you did, why you did it, and what it achieved. Interviewers are very interested in impact and how you arrived at that impact, so the STAR method is a great way to set yourself up for success. Let&amp;#39;s look at an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviewer: “Describe a time when your research didn’t align with what stakeholders want to hear?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAR method&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Situation&lt;/b&gt;: My team came up with a feature idea to create different travel package tiers for one project. The feature hadn’t come from research but was an idea to drive revenue and retention. After testing the concepts, the feedback was incredibly poor. No one was interested in having a travel membership, and our offers were not valuable to our users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Task&lt;/b&gt;: I was responsible for delivering these results to the team and helping them decide on the next steps. They had spent a reasonable amount of time on this idea, so I knew it would be hard for them to hear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action&lt;/b&gt;: I started by pulling together video clips of the feedback I received so the team could see the reactions. I then made two different lists: one which detailed what &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;didn&amp;#39;t &lt;/i&gt;work for the users and one which had positive feedback. During the presentation, I highlighted the other areas of value the participants pointed out. Rather than just telling the team the concept wouldn’t work, we discussed what could work instead. I gave us some extra time at the end of the presentation to brainstorm what would happen next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Result&lt;/b&gt;: The team switched their focus over to two major areas participants had commented on. We created two different features from that research, sharing trips with others and splitting costs on our platform, which customers heavily used. These features increased retention by 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method is a highly effective way for you to prove your impact!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Have questions ready&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One marker of a great candidate is the questions they ask at the end of the interview. As a hiring manager, this signifies that they are interested in the position. Asking questions at the end of the interview can also help me understand a candidate’s experience and approach. Although it doesn&amp;#39;t mean a ”hard no,” whenever candidates don’t ask questions, I feel a bit wary. As researchers, we are meant to ask questions, so I almost expect a long list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is also crucial for understanding if the company is a good fit &lt;i&gt;for you&lt;/i&gt;. It could be a red flag if they can’t answer your questions or give vague answers. Taking the time to ask questions can give you more data to make a better decision. I’ve found the more questions I ask, the fewer surprises I have once I’ve joined!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some example questions I love to ask (and hear, as a hiring manager):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does work get prioritized?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do research projects come from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do product managers, designers, developers, and the organization feel about user research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you define success in this role?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would you expect from this person in six months?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would be the biggest challenges for this role?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the team/organization deal with people making mistakes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are the big decision-makers? How would they impact research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When was your last project that made an impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the user research maturity at your organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do people react to mistakes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when research doesn’t align with what stakeholders want to hear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remember, it’s a two-way street&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so easy to get caught up in the stress of interviewing. There have been times I have put companies on pedestals. Even though they ghosted me for a month, canceled last minute, put the wrong people into the interview, and gave me no indication of the process, I still stuck with it. I believed it was my job to impress them, not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, I was in an interview—a phone interview, the worst kind—and I could hear the person texting with someone as I spoke. It was frustrating, but I moved on to the next round. During that video interview, the person was not paying attention and, at one point, rolled their eyes at one of my answers. I wish I could say I stopped the interview, but I went forward and accepted an offer. I was at the company for about two months before I quit. The environment was toxic and top-down, all things I could have seen from miles away during the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think through how the company is treating you in this process, as it reflects how they will treat you as an employee!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, although going through job interviews can be stressful, we can do many things to mitigate the overwhelm, making it a more calm experience. New job opportunities and career growth is exciting, so remember to take a deep breath and try to enjoy the journey!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Turn your research insights into actionable recommendations]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-report-recommendations-examples</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-report-recommendations-examples</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I could tell I was steadily improving in my report writing. People were more engaged &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-use-mixed-media-ux-research-reports/&quot;&gt;when I used video clips&lt;/a&gt; to show what the different users were doing or feeling. I was able to incorporate more infographics and annotations when doing usability testing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/writing-format-ux-research-report/&quot;&gt;My reports were more clear and straightforward&lt;/a&gt;. Colleagues started to use my research because it became more accessible to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of one presentation, my colleague approached me and asked what I recommended based on the research. I was a bit puzzled. I didn’t expect anyone to ask me this kind of question. By that point in my career, I wasn’t aware that I had to make recommendations based on the research insights. I could talk about the next steps regarding what other research we had to conduct. I could also relay the information that something wasn’t working in a prototype, but I had no idea what to suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, more and more colleagues asked for these recommendations. Finally, I realized that one of the key pieces I was missing in my reports was the “so what?” The prototype isn’t working, so what do we do next? Because I didn’t include suggestions, my colleagues had a difficult time marrying actions to my insights. Sure, the team could see the noticeable changes, but the next steps were a struggle, especially for generative research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without these suggestions, my insights started to fall flat. My colleagues were excited about them and loved seeing the video clips, but they weren’t working with the findings. With this, I set out to experiment on how to write recommendations within a user research report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to write recommendations &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, I wasn’t sure how to write recommendations. And, even now, I believe there is no &lt;i&gt;one right way&lt;/i&gt;. When I first started looking into this, I started with two main questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do recommendations mean to stakeholders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How prescriptive should recommendations be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people asked me for recommendations, I had no idea what they were looking for. I was nervous I would step on people’s toes and give the impression I thought I knew more than I did. I wasn’t a designer and didn’t want to make whacky design recommendations or impractical suggestions that would get developers rolling their eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, I dusted off my internal research cap and sat with stakeholders to understand what they meant by recommendations. I asked them for examples of what they expected and what made a suggestion “helpful” or “actionable.” I walked away with a list of “must-haves” for my recommendations. They had to be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible. &lt;/b&gt;Just because I made an initial recommendation did not mean it was the only path forward. Once I presented the recommendations, we could talk through other ideas and consider new information. There were a few times when I revised my recommendations based on conversations I had with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feasible.&lt;/b&gt; At first, I started presenting my recommendations without any prior feedback. My worst nightmare came true. The designer and developer sat back, arms crossed, and said, “A lot of this is impossible.” I quickly learned to review some of my recommendations I was uncertain about with them beforehand. Alternatively, I came up with several recommendations for one solution to help combat this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritized (to my best abilities).&lt;/b&gt; Since I am not entirely sure of the recommendation’s effort, I use a chart of impact and reach to prioritize suggestions. Then, once I present this list, it may get reprioritized depending on effort levels from the team (hey, flexibility!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detailed. &lt;/b&gt;This point helped me a lot with my second question regarding how in-depth I should make my recommendations. Some of the best detail comes from photos, videos, or screenshots, and colleagues appreciated when I linked recommendations with this media. They also told me to put in as much detail as possible to avoid vagueness, misinterpretation, and endless debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think MVP.&lt;/b&gt; Think about the solution with the fewest changes instead of recommending complex changes to a feature or product. What are some minor changes that the team can make to improve the experience or product?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justified. &lt;/b&gt;This part was the hardest for me. When my research findings didn’t align with expectations or business goals, I had no idea what to say. When I receive results that highlight we are going in the wrong direction, my recommendations become even more critical. Instead of telling the team that the new product or feature sucks and we should stop working on it, I offer alternatives. I follow the concept of “no, but...” So, “no, this isn’t working, but we found that users value X and Y, which could lead to increased retention” (or whatever metric we were looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let’s look at some examples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this list was beneficial in guiding my recommendations, I still wasn’t well-versed in how to write them. So, after some time, I created a formula for writing recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Observed problem/pain point/unmet need + consequence + potential solution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evaluative research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine we are testing a check-out page, and we found that users were having a hard time filling out the shipping and billing forms, especially when there were two different addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A non-specific and unhelpful recommendation might look like&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Users get frustrated when filling out the shipping and billing form.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reasons this recommendation is not ideal are&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides no context or detail of the problem &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no proposed solution &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds a bit judgemental (focus on the problem!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no immediate movement forward with this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A redesign recommendation about the same problem might look like this&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Users overlook the mandatory fields in the shipping and billing form, causing them to go back and fill out the form again. With this, they become frustrated. Include markers of required fields and avoid deleting information when users submit if they haven’t filled out all required fields.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let’s take another example&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested an entirely new concept for our travel company, allowing people to pay to become “prime” travel members. In our user base, no one found any value in having or paying for a membership. However, they did find value in several of the features, such as sharing trips with family members or splitting costs but could not justify paying for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A suboptimal recommendation could look like this&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Users would not sign-up or pay for a prime membership.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there is a considerable lack of context and understanding here, as well as action. Instead, we could try something like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Users do not find enough value in the prime membership to sign-up or pay for it. Therefore, they do not see themselves using the feature. However, they did find value in two features: sharing trips with friends and splitting the trip costs. Focusing, instead, on these features could bring more people to our platform and increase retention. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Generative research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative research can look a bit trickier because there isn’t always an inherent problem you are solving. For example, you might not be able to point to a usability issue, so you have to look more broadly at pain points or unmet needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in our generative research, we found that people often forget to buy gifts for loved ones, making them feel guilty and rushed at the last minute to find something meaningful but quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is extremely broad and could go in so many directions. With suggestions, we don’t necessarily want to lead our teams down only one path (flexibility!), but we also don’t want to leave the recommendation too vague (detailed). I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://dscout.com/people-nerds/how-might-we-statements&quot;&gt;How Might We statements&lt;/a&gt; to help me build generative research recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just reporting the above wouldn’t entirely be enough for a recommendation, so let’s try to put it in a more actionable format:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;People struggled to remember to buy gifts for loved one’s birthdays or special days. By the time their calendar notified them, it was too late to get a gift, leaving them filled with guilt and rushing to purchase a meaningful gift to arrive on time. How might we help people remember birthdays early enough to find meaningful gifts for their loved ones?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great follow-up to generative research recommendations can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://dscout.com/people-nerds/how-and-why-you-should-run-an-ideation-workshop&quot;&gt;running an ideation workshop&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to format recommendations in your report&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always end with recommendations because &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation/&quot;&gt;people leave a presentation with their minds buzzing&lt;/a&gt; and next steps top of mind (hopefully!). My favorite way to format suggestions is in a chart. That way, I can link the recommendation back to the insight and priority. My recommendations look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, play around with the recommendations that you give to your teams. The best thing you can do is ask for what they expect and then ask for feedback. By catering and iterating to your colleagues’ needs, you will help them make better decisions based on your research insights!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;

Coming from academia, where my audience highly regarded long-winded (yet eloquent) papers, I thought I could do the same as a user researcher. My initial reports were packed full of words. I fit as much text on a slide as humanly possible. It was the best way I knew to convey information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn&amp;#39;t very well-received. From the beginning, everyone told me to be more visual. I should add charts, graphs, and visualizations to make my user research reports easier to digest and helpful for teams. The problem? I hated creating visual presentations. Not because I disagreed that they were better, but because I had no idea how to put the words into easy-to-understand graphics. It was a total nightmare for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I understood that not every report had to have beautiful infographics and charts. It wasn&amp;#39;t about creating stunning visuals but conveying the meaning and impact of the research. There are a variety of ways to do this. Since then, I have ensured my reports are full of mixed media. With these changes, stakeholders paid more attention to findings and ingested research more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a mixed media report?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mixed media report is one that includes multiple media types outside of just words. In my research presentations, I use a mixture of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video clips of research sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audio clips of research sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos of settings (during contextual inquiry)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annotations of prototypes or concepts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infographics, including charts and graphs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research deliverables, such as personas and journey maps, are different types of media that I won&amp;#39;t cover in this article. However, they are helpful when conveying research projects, so keep them in mind! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mixing different media types in my reports, I saw a massive lift in the conversion of my research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I used to fill my presentations with only words, people would nod off or miss the point. Words are powerful, but they didn&amp;#39;t get across what I needed to. The first idea I experimented with was video clips. As soon as I started adding video clips to my presentations, my stakeholders perked up, especially those who weren&amp;#39;t present in the sessions. I managed to bridge the gap between users and stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I made this change, stakeholders started to discuss my research more seriously. My findings became actionable because I &lt;i&gt;showed&lt;/i&gt; them what was happening to users. As a result, they better understood their decisions&amp;#39; impact on users and how those decisions affected their goals. For example, if my colleagues decided on a particular experience for a checkout funnel, they weren&amp;#39;t sure if it would positively uplift metrics. By showing stakeholders how users responded to a design and experience decision, they knew what wasn&amp;#39;t going well and could generate ideas to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know reports can come in many different forms, and some don&amp;#39;t lend themselves to mixed media. For instance, I give a lot of presentations via Google Slides or Powerpoint. Presentations are a great way to incorporate mixed media. However, I have also written paper reports and find it much more challenging to include media that isn&amp;#39;t too academic. I use infographics that I can easily paste into Word or a Google Doc for written reports. I also link out to video or audio clips so readers can experience them easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Incorporate different types of media&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because there are many different media types doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to use all of them at once. When I discovered I could use these, I piled them all into one report. I thought, the more, the merrier, or more impactful. Unfortunately, my poor colleagues were extremely overwhelmed by all the graphs, videos, and charts jumping out on them, and I lost the presentation thread. Since then, I have used one or two media types per presentation and never go above three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when are the different media types most effective? Let&amp;#39;s dive into each type and explore how and when to use each one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video clips &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I constantly use video clips to make it easy for colleagues to understand what happened and why and better empathize with the user in a particular situation. Video clips are an effective manner of conveying pain points and struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use video clips, mainly when usability testing a prototype or interactive concept. I pick the clips where users struggle the most with a specific task and are frustrated or failing to achieve the task. Usually, I choose a task that many users grappled with and create a &amp;quot;highlight reel&amp;quot; across participants. This highlight reel of pain points calls attention to what went wrong and gives stakeholders the context to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goals for using video clips:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convey pain points within a product, prototype, or concept&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show the audience how a variety of participants reacted to a task or experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make insights feel more actionable and real&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivate a sense of empathy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Audio clips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I default to video clips, audio clips are also helpful in communicating a message. When conducting generative research, and the video is of the participant and me, I sometimes opt for an audio clip. The audio clip allows my audience to focus on the participant&amp;#39;s words rather than getting distracted by irrelevant video. I also use audio clips when there are several important points I want to get across. I embed the clips after introducing a theme or pattern in the research as &amp;quot;evidence.&amp;quot; Typically, I use audio clips to highlight needs or pain points that come up during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goals for using audio clips:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivate a sense of empathy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show unmet needs or pain points at a larger scale (not only with a product or prototype)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give evidence to themes or patterns found in the research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photos &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A picture is worth a thousand words. That saying rings true in research reports as well. I use photos primarily to convey the participant&amp;#39;s environment and setting. I gather these photos through either contextual inquiry (in-person) or diary studies. A snapshot of someone&amp;#39;s working environment or home can give stakeholders an inside view into users. We can learn so much from setting—why users work in certain ways, what may be working against them, and how they react to their environment. Whenever possible, I like to use photos with audio clips, giving both a visual and auditory experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goals for using photos:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show environment, ecosystem, or setting of users that the audience usually doesn&amp;#39;t see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give context to how a product, prototype, or concept may fit into a user&amp;#39;s environment/setting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivate a sense of empathy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annotations of prototypes or concepts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I do a usability test, I use annotations. They are the most powerful tool that I can use to show details on what went wrong during a usability test. I take a screenshot of the app or desktop and then use arrows to point to specific areas of the prototype, product, or concept difficult for participants. I write briefly what went wrong. At the end of the presentation, I recap the annotations in a chart. I use annotations and video clips together. The video clips illustrate the most severe usability issues after I show an annotation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goals for using annotations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show the areas that were difficult or problematic for users &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give a detailed walkthrough of a prototype, product, or concept and what needs to be improved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infographics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the dreaded infographics—at least they were for me. I used to write out participant information into an enormous, blobby paragraph or explain the results of a survey through words. But, once I found out infographics weren&amp;#39;t impossible to create, I used them in my presentations. Whenever I have quantitative data to share, my go-to is a chart or a graph. You can also use infographics for smaller sample sizes by using visuals to explain your most important findings or the number of people who brought up a particular insight. If you have a hard time with infographics, check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canva.com/design/DAEE2yiVH0Q/4k5SHVab6BtO-8JR-Z_UlQ/view?utm_content=DAEE2yiVH0Q&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton&amp;mode=preview&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canva templates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get started!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goals for using infographics:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show quantitative data results from surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visually explain major trends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding these various media types to your presentations can make your audience pay more attention and make your insights more actionable. Our goal as researchers is to bridge the gap between users and the organization, and including these media types in presentations helps lessen that gap beyond words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;

What better way to be reminded of all the travel they missed out on in 2021 than 3M’s new ‘International Experiences You Missed Out On’ sticky note set. Don’t worry, they’re the standard sticky notes and not those zig-zag refills that Derek always orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zoom subscription ($14.99).&lt;/b&gt; Remote research is here to stay, so why not upgrade your researcher to a premium Zoom subscription. You know they’ve been too busy this year to ask for the corporate card, and the free version’s lack of encryption is a bit shady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Sample Size is Fine, Thank You Very Much poster ($19.99).&lt;/b&gt; Hang this poster on the wall behind your researcher, in plain view of the webcam, so she can let that persistent engineer know that her qualitative research projects don’t need to be statistically significant. We’re doing &lt;i&gt;directional research&lt;/i&gt;, Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gut feel air horn ($40).&lt;/b&gt; Equip your researcher with a novel way to grab attention in meetings: just blow the air horn when someone (usually a product manager) makes a terrible assumption about your user base. It’s the fastest way to be muted, but it’ll get the point across!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Santa’s Incentive Management Service ($100 / participant).&lt;/b&gt; Forget Amazon vouchers—outsource your incentives to Santa for just $100 per participant and benefit from proven experience choosing and delivering gifts to zip codes worldwide, within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participant drop-out insurance ($199).&lt;/b&gt; Purchase State Farm’s new participant drop-out insurance and they’ll deliver a demographically-pleasing warm body ready to sub in for that pesky participant who refuses to show up to a 7am concept testing session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LG 34&amp;quot; UltraWide monitor ($800).&lt;/b&gt; How else are you supposed to see all of the columns in the analysis spreadsheet at the same time? Have you seen one of these spreadsheets? How are they so wide, the column names are two characters!?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FBI WitRecruit subscription ($500 / participant).&lt;/b&gt; Make CCPA, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 compliance a breeze by recruiting participants solely through the FBI’s witness protection program—names and all other personal information is already anonymized!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research Report Self-Reader plugin for Confluence ($1,000).&lt;/b&gt; After installation, your researcher will sleep easy knowing that their reports will be read at least once, even if it is by a recycled Google Home in a Nebraskan cornfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Veritaserum (Priceless).&lt;/b&gt; Channel Walter White from &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/i&gt; and set up a lab in your home office (off-camera) and concoct the truth serum from &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt;. Pop it in a vial, add a cute ribbon, and ship it off to your researcher—they might finally get to that fifth why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automatic Highlighter 9000 (Priceless).&lt;/b&gt; While natural language processing and artificial intelligence are certainly impressive these days, after toiling away in Dovetail for hours on end, your researcher surely wants someone—&lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;—to do their analysis for them. Purchase the Automatic Highlighter 9000, a robotic marker drone with wheels that traverses your transcript printouts and finds key quotes. Or you could just get an intern.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to write an executive summary people will read]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-write-an-executive-summary</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-write-an-executive-summary</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Executive summaries remind me of phrases like “actionable insights.” These buzzwords are vague enough to know they are essential, but it is impossible to determine what they mean. For years, I heard about how critical it is to include executive summaries in research presentations. They give the reader the ability to understand the report quickly and get the most important information at a glance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I come from academia, I likened the executive summary to an abstract. An abstract summarizes the larger research paper by highlighting the significant points and reasons behind the research. I struggled with this concise roundup of my work in my previous academic papers. And I fought just as much with writing executive summaries. I agonized, trying to find examples online (which are few and far between), and eventually forced myself to write something I knew wasn’t an accurate executive summary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After much trial and error, I decided to end my misery. I dreaded writing reports, made worse by the anxiety-inducing executive summary slide, which I would stare at for hours. How should I pick the most crucial information from all my findings? And how do I distill the entire study into a few headers and bullet points? Eventually, the lightbulb clicked. I began to ask stakeholders to give me feedback on these summaries, asking them what they thought, what was missing, or what was too much information. I A/B tested different formats, gathering more feedback and honing, until I landed on something that seemed to work across organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just goes to show you, when in doubt, do some research!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The ingredients of a successful executive summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An executive summary shows readers the findings or insights they need to know if they just read one slide. Now, this isn’t the best principle. We want people to read our full reports because we can’t possibly encapsulate all of the data into an executive summary. However, no matter how hard we try, some people won’t read entire reports, so we still have to find ways to get the most important information across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summary enables teams to see the most impactful details from a particular study. If someone were to read the slide, they should be able to take something away to help them make decisions. As user researchers, we must learn how to be concise. The executive summary gives us the chance to surface the most critical information teams need to know from a given project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set-up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen executive summaries that span several pages. I have even seen one that was ten slides long. As I mentioned, the purpose of an executive summary is to highlight the essential information as efficiently as possible. Typically, this means one page, at the absolute most, two pages. But I would say, always strive for one page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this one page, my structure for an executive summary highlights the top three to five findings or insights in my study. In general, I will cover:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising finding/insight &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One to two things that went badly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If space, an additional finding/insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this structure is helpful, it is the frustratingly vague type of structure I referenced when trying to write these summaries. How do you know which is the most positive insight? Or what went poorly? Or what information to include and what to talk about later. Let’s dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questions to ask yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I went about writing executive summaries without much direction. I wasn’t sure how to find the correct information to put into this synopsis of my study. Over time, I developed a list of questions I would ask myself to pull out the most valuable information from the rest. Here are the questions I ask myself when creating an executive summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surprising finding:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of our assumptions or hypotheses were validated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What were we risking, and how did that risk play out well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What information could have a considerable positive impact on users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is something that changed the way we think about users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is something new we discovered that we didn’t know before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Negative findings:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What issues did we uncover?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of our hypotheses or assumptions were invalidated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What information has a considerable negative impact on users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What information makes us question the direction we are going?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other findings:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened that was completely unexpected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What information could help a team make a better decision moving forward?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t magically pick the best three insights on my first go. Instead, I ask myself these questions and write down any findings or insights that answer these questions. This process results in a list of about ten pieces of data. Once I have that list, I start narrowing down which information could impact the team’s decisions and best reflect the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/elevate-your-research-objectives-745cf9415d5b?sk=3ce9f4194a9ebe18d4a799a9bbdc9f8f&quot;&gt;research study goals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My executive summaries all look pretty much the same. Through keeping this consistency, it makes it easier for me to write the summary. I use the following structure and template for each insight:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A header that is a few words long&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concise one to two sentences of what you learned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example that demonstrates what you learned, such as a quote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequence of what you learned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If relevant or possible, a small recommendation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, this is easier said than done. It takes some practice writing executive summaries before you become more confident and comfortable. When I was learning this skill, I felt I lacked a concrete example. So, let’s dive into one to demonstrate the ingredients and structure of an executive summary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example project, we were trying to understand how different groups of people plan travel. We looked at student travelers (e.g., students traveling home) and business travelers (e.g., business trips) and how they make decisions to travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Executive summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insight one&lt;/b&gt;: Cheaper prices are not the only deciding factor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although lower prices are enticing for students and business travelers, they are not the only factors at play. Instead, these travelers weigh and balance a triangle of information: price, comfort (duration, number of changeovers), and trust in the booking platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, cheap tickets are great, but I am not going to take an eleven-hour trip with three changeovers to get to a place I know is two or three hours away if I pay a bit more. Plus, these third-party websites selling tickets always ask for more money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By surfacing the cheapest tickets first and assuming this is the trigger for purchase, we are not giving users the best results for their search, considering their decision-making process. We may be losing trust and revenue through this experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recommendation: &lt;/b&gt;Include trips that may be more expensive, but get the user to their destination more quickly (still within a suitable price range). Also, ensure all charges are transparent for the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insight two: &lt;/b&gt;Flexibility in dates leads to multiple searches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These travelers can be relatively flexible with their traveling dates, which gives them the space to search within a date range to find the best trip. However, this concludes in many different searches and comparing prices/trips across multiple tabs, frustrating the user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to see if it was cheaper to take the train on a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, and it just got so complicated to do and compare all of these searches—it was frustrating.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By forcing our users to compare different date possibilities across tabs, we put them in a difficult situation. They may go to another product or competitor that makes this experience easier for them. Ultimately, this could end in us losing revenue and retention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recommendation: &lt;/b&gt;Allow users to search with flexible calendar dates within one search to compare their different options on one screen easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insight three: &lt;/b&gt;Lack of trust when booking through a third-party&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is easy for travelers to see all options when looking up travel on a third-party website, there is an inherent lack of trust. Extra fees, lost luggage, and lack of customer support have burned many travelers when they’ve booked through a third-party website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As much as I want to trust these websites, I can’t. Once I bought a ticket through a website, they canceled my seat last minute, didn’t offer me a refund, and the flight provider couldn’t do anything about it. It just makes me not trust all the smoke and mirrors. Plus, I end up paying so much in fees that I should go directly to the provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the lack of trust in third-party websites, there are times we are a search engine rather than a booking platform. They use our website to compare travel options and then go directly to the provider to purchase tickets. With this process, we end up losing money and customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One last note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the time to practice these executive summaries. It took me a while to get to the stage where I could pinpoint the vital information and distill it into one concise slide. Start by asking yourself those questions about your study, do a brain dump, and then work your way down to the top three to five insights. It is well worth it when your research becomes more digestible and read by people who don’t have enough time to take on the full report!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looking for some advice on how to create awesome reports in Dovetail? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/guides/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Check out our Guides&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; for a great rundown on reporting using Insights.

You have your shiny new computer, your LinkedIn is updated, and you’re ready to shake things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome aboard,&amp;quot; says the friendly product manager, &amp;quot;Hope you’re ready to roll up your sleeves and disrupt the industry. Let me know if you have any questions before we get started. Oh, and by the way, we have more than 20 engineers waiting for your designs for this upcoming sprint, but no rush...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Gulp)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are if you’re reading this you’ve experienced a similar situation before. As UX designers, our job is to bridge the needs of our users and the business to create the best experience for both. But how do we do that when we’re starting from scratch and know very little about the domain we’re entering? Who are our users? What are their problems? What are their goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham Lincoln says it best:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, UX Research is our axe and the tree is our user experience—the better we understand our users and their problems, the easier it will be to address and &lt;i&gt;anticipate&lt;/i&gt; their needs. With this, every great product starts with excellent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With UX, there are dozens of research methods for discovery, testing, and validation—but what’s the right &lt;i&gt;methodology &lt;/i&gt;(i.e., evaluative, generative, explorative, quantitative, qualitative, etc.)&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;to drive our research method selection? In our case, when you’re in a new domain building out foundational research or looking to gather large amounts of raw data from several data sources, one methodology always sticks out —Grounded Theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across GT nearly four years ago when I was running a research discovery effort for a large fortune 100 client that needed to “start over.” Their previous research had gone stale and they were losing touch with their users and what problems to solve. I figured GT, with its simple &lt;b&gt;bottom-up approach to data-driven theory generation&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;would be the perfect methodology for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, in this article, you’ll see how Grounded Theory can help you build data-driven theories about your users, their environment, and the phenomena (an observable fact or event) as a whole to inform your customer understandings and design decisions moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is grounded theory? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re aware of it or not, you’ve most likely used Grounded theory methodology and methods in your day-to-day UX practices. When attempting to generate theories from your qualitative research data, GT is widely seen as the “go-to” methodology. Since its inception nearly five decades ago by two sociologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Grounded-Theory-Strategies-Qualitative/dp/0202302601&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Glaser and Strauss&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GT has spread from sociology to other social sciences and fields of study, such as public health, education, business management, and now user experience research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#39;The discovery of theory from data systematically obtained from social research&amp;#39;&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Grounded-Theory-Strategies-Qualitative/dp/0202302601&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Glaser and Strauss 1967&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of GT is to &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;generate theories that emerge from or are ”grounded” in data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. It is used to uncover learnings around processes, social relationships, and behaviors of groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I work in the insurance industry. When I first entered the industry, I figured price was the driving component behind a business owner’s purchasing behavior. However, after several rounds of interviews, I learned the relationship with the insurance agent is orders of magnitude more important, since the business owner needs to have “peace of mind” that their business is insured appropriately. They wanted a “trusted advisor”, not just an affordable insurance policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With GT, we’re tasked with the goal of finding patterns and categories that might emerge from the data rather than making assumptions (“insurance buyers just want the cheapest policy”). The theory needs to be “grounded” in the data, hence “Grounded Theory”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So then, what is considered “data”? Really anything that comes out of a research method (quantitative or qualitative) should be considered data when developing your theories. Primarily, you’ll want your theories steeped in first-party data (from your interviews, feedback sessions, etc.) but feel free to harden your theories with even third-party data like whitepapers or academic resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to use grounded theory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need to familiarize yourself with a new domain or topic and you want to be close to the data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there is a lack of existing theories or research available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to create theories or insights with a mixed-methods approach (qual/quant)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When collecting a large amount of data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of grounded theory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great for new projects where discovery and exploratory methods are needed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produces large amounts of data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides a “fresh” perspective on deep and rich data surrounding a given research topic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helps reduce confirmation bias since everything is rooted in data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a researcher/designer has a nuanced level of understanding on a topic, they’re enabled to think divergently and creatively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GT is very flexible and the methods employed can change as the research study progresses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If adopted across the organization, GT supports a structured approach to data analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observations/findings are easily traceable and tightly connected to the source data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limitations of grounded theory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of GT is extremely time consuming and can be difficult to do consistently as more and more data comes in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The methods for data collection and analysis take skill and proper training to perform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With large amounts of data in hand, it can pose problems to manage and analyze consistently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each research topic has no guaranteed start/end date&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty recruiting for ongoing research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grounded theory approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to GT, a researcher does not just begin with a theory and set out to prove it. Rather, a researcher begins with an area of study and allows relevant data&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most research efforts, GT starts off with a research question—this question helps define the scope (who to talk to and what to ask about) and strategy (what methods to use) around the research topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grounded theory steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Data Collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In grounded theory, data collection is exactly the same as traditional qualitative research methods and typically begins with a research question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a research question/area of interest has been identified, it’s important to begin your research by taking a few steps back and starting with very broad concepts, more general in your thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you’re familiar with the topic at hand it’s equally important to remove biases and assumptions. To do this effectively, try to adjust your worldview and remove any existing theories you might have so you can evaluate the data with a fresh perspective and allow the world to teach you the words, phrases, and idioms while you’re studying and observing so you can ask the “dumb questions” (“what does that mean? Can you explain…?, etc.”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, “all is data” so get creative with what data you collect and how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sample list of data collection methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recorded in-depth interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-app feedback tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer advisory boards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product analytics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note-taking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coding and Tagging (analysis)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coding (and tagging) can simply be defined as the process of breaking down your data and organizing them by codes (or labels) so you can identify themes and causal relationships between disparate points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By its nature, the process of data collection and analysis in grounded theory is quite flexible and can often be done simultaneously. This type of back and forth is called the “zig-zag approach” to collection and analysis where the researcher is continuously refining their “concepts” and “categories” (we’ll define these in a second) on the subject until there is diminishing returns or “theoretical saturation” (when new data comes in and does not lead to refinement of thinking or new ideas). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;**Aside**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in the data collection phase, thematic analysis tends to go hand-in-hand with grounded theory and is one of my personal favorites when analyzing large amounts of data and setting up a proper UX repository (especially in Dovetail)! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;**End Aside**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing your data, we need to somehow deconstruct it so we can reassemble it into actionable information or findings—we do this by evaluating our data and organizing our findings into concepts and categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Concepts” are your low-level codes, or put simply, the first layer of data you highlight/ tag that you found important. I once asked my mentor—“what should I code?” and she said, “code and tag anything that you might find interesting and that you might want to share with me if we bumped into each other in the hallway...”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s quite simple. Anything that you find interesting is meaningful—tag it! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s “concepts” in GT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, “categories” are clustered concepts that have similar ideas (and can come from several data sources). Typically, these are written in the form of insights or themes in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key method that’s used in grounded theory is called the “constant comparative” method, which means any findings (concepts, categories, theories, etc.) are constantly compared against each other as new data emerges in order to further refine your interpretations and theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Revising data collection methods through theoretical sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any process of analysis, it’s important to look back and course-correct. How are things going? Are we learning anything new? Are we surprised by the new data coming in or are we receiving similar answers? Are the existing categories and concepts abundantly supported?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In grounded theory, Glaser and Strauss call this process “theoretical sampling”, and it&amp;#39;s a way for researchers to identify a category that might need further research and inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaser and Strauss on theoretical sampling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The process of data collection for generating theory whereby the analyst jointly collects, codes, and analyzes his data and decides what data to collect next and where to find them” —&lt;/i&gt; Glaser and Strauss (1967)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you review your concepts and categories over time, your existing research should help direct (or redirect) you as to where to go and what data to collect next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do researchers know when to stop collecting data? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strauss calls this moment “theoretical saturation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Theoretical saturation: The point in category development at which no new properties, dimensions, or relationships emerge during analysis”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when the concepts and categories are theoretically saturated and no new concepts are emerging from the data!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Theory Building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly and most importantly, in order to identify a theory that has emerged from the data, you have to have a deep and nuanced understanding of it—Glaser and Strauss call this “theoretical sensitivity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretical sensitivity simply means that through the ongoing process of data collection, analysis, and even more collection, researchers become more familiar with the data and are able to unearth insights and evaluate relationships between concepts and categories that lead to relevant theories (or insights). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In grounded theory, most of these theories come from identified categories which are also referred to as “core categories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, writing theories are not as actionable for our needs in the user experience space, therefore, I’ve found that writing your learnings as one of the following can be helpful:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insight statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job-To-Be-Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrangling research data and developing theories surrounding your topic can be overwhelming and difficult. As a researcher who also designs, I’m all for making things easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use GT to organize your data and consistently groom it for structured, deliberate, and insightful theories/learnings. The consistency, clearly defined and organized concepts and categories will help you over the long run! Additionally, as a design manager (who’s currently hiring &lt;i&gt;wink wink&lt;/i&gt;) it’s important to have a consistent process among our UX teams when it comes to data collection and analysis, so when we scale our research efforts, we’re not left with a dumping ground of raw data, rather clearly defined piles of dynamite insights!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you’re poised with a discovery project or enter a new job in a new industry, give Grounded Theory a try and watch the learnings pile up! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article covers the very basics of grounded theory, if you’re interested in learning more please &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atomicuxresearch.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;check out my full course on UX research&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and a few of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Grounded-Theory-Strategies-Qualitative/dp/0202302601/ref=asc_df_0202302601/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312407247347&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=12897809203569827628&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9011682&amp;hvtargid=pla-466623713183&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;my favorite books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.

I joined Dovetail after about six years in the software industry; three years as a developer and three as an engineering manager. I’ve been in a mix of teams and roles over my career, but what I love about work is improving customers’ lives through software, so I often end up in product teams. In my spare time, you can find me at the arcade tearing up the rhythm games, watching anime, or enjoying a whisky tasting and pretending I can tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blog is a high-level reflection of my six months at Dovetail after leaving a mammoth technology company. Like loads of my mates here, I left a big company to join Dovetail. You should read this if you’re interested in my authentic take about the differences between a big company and Dovetail after six months or considering a similar change yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It certainly wasn’t an easy decision, but it might’ve been easier if I had more information or some opinions from people who’d done it before. So buckle up; that’s what I’m offering you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Push and pull forces&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, a significant source of pain was feeling frustrated with the inability to change things at a big company. The day-to-day had gotten so process-heavy that I had lost a lot of my autonomy. Changing things was daunting, not motivating. You’d also hear other folks say that they’ve felt the culture steadily declining, or they’re struggling with career growth in their current role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all &lt;i&gt;push forces&lt;/i&gt;. They’re pushing you away from your current position. They’re useful for identifying what you’re unhappy about but focusing on push forces alone will not help you find a meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to weigh up &lt;i&gt;pull forces&lt;/i&gt;—what attracts you to other options—to make the best decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pull forces of Dovetail compared to a big company&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might not apply to everyone, but reflecting on my first six months, these are the things that I think have been the biggest “pull forces” of Dovetail compared to a big company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The high velocity of changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is probably not a surprise. Yes, I can confirm that you can get things done faster without the burden of a dozen dependent teams, changes needing to be planned a quarter in advance, and an uncomfortable amount of distinct codebases and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll typically &lt;b&gt;own features end-to-end&lt;/b&gt; at Dovetail, compared to a &lt;i&gt;slice&lt;/i&gt; of a feature in a big company. Fewer dependencies mean you are empowered to (and expected to) get your hands into all parts of the codebase and across the whole architecture to get things done. We deploy daily and seeing our internal changelog each deployment is baffling compared with my previous teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our hackathon, Make It, ends with things actually shipped.&lt;/b&gt; This makes the ritual much more meaningful and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It’s super motivating seeing what everyone’s achieved at weekly demos.&lt;/b&gt; This one was an unexpected delighter for me. More changes means demos are more interesting. Also, since demos are company-wide, getting an insight into what’s going on cross-functionally is really neat to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The quality bar is very high&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Product Designer founded Dovetail, and it shows. The culture of quality, from sweating the details on margins to religiously ensuring UX makes sense as much as possible, has transformed me as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m a better engineer thanks to the quality culture.&lt;/b&gt; At my last job, it often felt like the goal was to ship the bare minimum as close to the target date as possible, probably due to more dependencies, stakeholders, and deadlines. Working at Dovetail has rewired my brain to place more of a focus on quality. I like this because I’d rather be an engineer more skilled in building a high-quality product than skilled at whittling scope and hitting deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone maintains the quality bar at Dovetail.&lt;/b&gt; I’ve seen the engineering, support, marketing, and revenue teams all have input and display a sense of ownership of the customer experience—not just the designers and product managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone has customer empathy.&lt;/b&gt; It wasn’t easy to talk to customers at my previous company. User researchers, often your only direct line to the customer, were few and overloaded. Getting involved in research was a chore and self-driven. At Dovetail, we use our tool internally, spend time on support, and lurk in our Slack community, which builds a lot of customer context and empathy—driving quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The codebase has scaled surprisingly well&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given all the junk I just said about shipping quickly, you’d expect it to be “scrappy central” over here, but no. Far from scrappy, the codebase has scaled with a 3 to 4x increase in engineers without falling over. Getting a dev environment set up remains super simple, and our robust typing system makes it easy to get familiar with. I spent a lot of my time working around legacy code at my previous company, but that’s just not a thing that happens at Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The team is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; good&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies say they hire the best. One thing that I think stands out about the Dovetail engineering team is the breadth of skills. Because of the expectation to own features end-to-end, the engineers are exposed to a wider variety of technologies. They have a broader understanding of systems than engineers on other teams I’ve worked with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broad skillsets, combined with the customer and design-led culture, make the team highly effective engineers. It’s a team I’m incredibly proud to be part of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the company, another thing I really like is that we celebrate individuality. Being a smaller company, we all know each other, and the team is wonderfully accepting. You can see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; embodied every day—my favorite practical value is “Do the thing.” I think it tempers our quality obsession with a deeper level of pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s refreshing to have delighted customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another surprising delighter for me was the experience of telling people where I work. “Whoa! I LOVE Dovetail!” feels much better than “Oh, you work on &amp;lt;big slow product&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;avoids eye contact&amp;gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does this resonate with you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, you’re in luck. We’re tripling the engineering team over the next year. Come and be a part of the journey and delight customers, work with some of the best, have the type of impact you’re looking for, and become the best engineer you can be.

Everyone was invited with no choice but to attend.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My taxi driver, Ricardo, solemnly shared this analogy about the coronavirus as he skillfully navigated the streets of Ensenada, a port city off the Pacific Coast of Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. At this moment, it was impossible not to reflect on COVID-19’s effect on our personal and professional lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defining the Great Resignation and its impact &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding our professional lives, perhaps one of the most fascinating and unexpected outcomes has been the mass resignation of working professionals that economists have dubbed “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/great-resignation-misses-the-point/&quot;&gt;The Great Resignation&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many individuals have called it quits thus far? Over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/quits-rate-of-2-9-percent-in-august-2021-an-all-time-high.htm&quot;&gt;4.3 million in the US&lt;/a&gt; as of August 2021, according to the US Department of Labor. In Australia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-29-gartner-hr-survey-shows-a-quarter-of-australian-emplo&quot;&gt;a recent Gartner survey&lt;/a&gt; reported that one in four Aussies are on the lookout for a new job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is driving this phenomenon? According to Professor Anthony Klotz, the Texas A&amp;amp;M instructor who coined the term Great Resignation, “When we come into contact with life-threatening events, we tend to reflect on death and consider whether we are happy with our lives or whether we would like to make changes to them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionals are leaving their positions in nearly all industries. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2021/09/who-is-driving-the-great-resignation&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review &lt;/a&gt;wrote that resignations have been particularly high in the tech and healthcare industries, which have “experienced extreme increases in demand due to the pandemic, likely leading to increased workloads and burnout.” Organizations with UX teams are no exception. We recently asked Jared Spool what would be a significant upcoming trend in UX? He answered the Employee Experience. Specifically, that “UX people will be the logical folks to start looking at this because they have a language and tools to talk about experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is Employee Experience, and why is it important?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from the venerable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/&quot;&gt;Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen’s definition of User Experience&lt;/a&gt;, the Employee Experience from a UX perspective refers to &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; aspects of an employee’s interaction with their company. This encompasses everything, from high-level organizational policies to the small details of their day-to-day responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Employee Experience has always been crucial to the attraction and retention of outstanding employees—which is closely tied to any company’s economic success. It becomes more significant than ever with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm&quot;&gt;US Bureau of Labor&lt;/a&gt; reporting over 10.4 million job openings at the end of August 2021 in conjunction with the widespread resignations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can UX practitioners help alleviate the Great Resignation? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can engage in what we do best: following a human-centric design framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listen and observe: &lt;/b&gt;Begin by reviewing what your organization already knows. Connect with people managers within the UX team and cross-functional collaborators from HR and Talent Acquisition to better understand employee retention (or lack thereof) at your company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conversations should lead to a greater understanding of what’s working well and what’s not in terms of employee satisfaction. From there, try scheduling time with colleagues—and even former colleagues—to understand what they enjoy/don’t enjoy about working at your organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time allows, you might even quantify the impact of resignations on key business metrics to share with key stakeholders. This could potentially lead to formal support and budget to improve the employee experience at your organization!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ideate: &lt;/b&gt;Aided with an understanding of the context and scope of employee satisfaction at your organization, begin brainstorming potential initiatives to fill gaps and needs. Generate names and descriptions about their details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prototype and gather feedback: &lt;/b&gt;Bring your ideas to life! Pilot them with actual users. As with product designs, they can be low-fidelity to minimize required time and resources. Afterward, don’t forget to gather feedback from the participants; in this case, the employees you’re designing for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iterate and implement: &lt;/b&gt;Leverage the information you used in the previous phase to improve—or even create new—initiatives to enhance the employee experience. Once you’ve refined the program and have buy-in from key stakeholders, you can implement and scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building blocks of an improved Employee Experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the particular steps needed to improve Employee Experience at each organization will vary from company to company, here are several high-potential opportunity areas based on conversations I’ve had with UX, Program Management, and HR professionals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Onboarding: &lt;/b&gt;This is an organization’s opportunity to make a great first impression. The process should be engaging and relevant—rather than mundane and tedious. Especially in remote onboarding, they should share how to navigate remote/hybrid working environments and explain any new company policies. We only have one chance to make a first impression, and creativity plus empathy can go a long way in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility: &lt;/b&gt;As countless organizations transitioned to work-from-home, employees are becoming accustomed to the perks that come with no longer being tied to an office. More time to spend with loved ones as a result of eliminated commute times. More funds to use on items and experiences from reducing the costs associated with vehicle operation and maintenance. Whether it’s a full-remote or hybrid setup, flexible work conditions have become a key element of a great Employee Experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connection: &lt;/b&gt;While the benefits of remote work outweigh the cons for many, human connection has decreased with the lack of in-person serendipitous interactions. As social creatures, this sense of connection and belonging is still important. Thus, virtual team-building experiences and periodic safe gatherings following local guidelines can help fill this gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Career fulfillment and professional development: &lt;/b&gt;One of the amazing aspects of working in UX is the variety of industries you can work in. UX professionals often seek meaningful work in which they’re tackling interesting challenges and helping people. They also want to grow their hard and soft skills. Creating and highlighting these opportunities to employees can go a long way towards improving the Employee Experience and boosting retention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving onwards and upwards &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might not have predicted The Great Resignation, but it serves as an incredible opportunity to pause and reflect on the Employee Experience. What is working well? What isn’t? How can we improve it? There are countless possibilities, including improved onboarding, flexibility, connection, and professional development opportunities. Following human-centric design can be a powerful step towards answering these questions.

One suggested solve for this problem is the scaling of user research by “democratizing” research activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help us understand the changing nature of the research profession and the practical benefits and applications of research democratization, we spoke with Dovetail’s Product Design Lead Lucy Denton who has years of experience working in highly customer-centric product teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the democratization of research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of democratization is murky at best. At a very high level, it means engaging stakeholders in the research process. This could be through observation, collaboration, or training. The extent to which stakeholders actually run research projects themselves is a hot area of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some groups advocate for training stakeholders to run their own evaluative testing. The idea is that by “offloading” more granular research tasks, full-time researchers will have more capacity to focus on strategic research that yields higher impact for the organization. This approach isn’t without its detractors. On one end, researchers believe this threatens to dilute the craft. On the other, thought leaders like Jared Spool don’t believe this kind of training yields the desired impact. Spool, for example, believes democratizing research activities in this way only offloads unpleasant or repetitive tasks to stakeholders who stand to gain very little real customer insight (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/jared-spool-democratization-research&quot;&gt;check out his full opinion on the matter here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a more nuanced approach is simply considering the democratization of research as a structured approach to transforming an organization’s culture. By equipping everybody with the right knowledge and tools and providing opportunities to interface with customers in a formal way, democratization allows stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of the customers they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The changing role of research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One approach to democratization argues that in mature organizations, user researchers could add research enablement to their activities, helping to lead a research-driven, evidence-led culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s Product Design Lead Lucy Denton sees this shift as similar to the evolution of designers in product team. And there are distinct parallels between the changing nature of both roles that can help us better understand the direction research is headed and perhaps guide researchers looking to have more impact in their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Design has gone through a whole journey to get people to understand their process better, and I think research is going through the same thing at the moment,” says Lucy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of the designer evolved as design professionals began to seek a greater stake in the strategic decision-making processes of the business, says Lucy. “I see it as part of a researcher’s job to enable people in the organization to do their own learning with customers and scale that function and build a user-centered organization and product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, “democratization” is more about research professionals driving a customer-centric culture powered by high-quality research. It’s less about offloading repetitive tasks and more about closing the customer understanding gap in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A guide towards greater customer understanding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are becoming keen collaborators, enablers, champions, and facilitators, pushing their teams to embrace a culture of curiosity and learning. Through exposure to the research craft, methods, and ways of thinking, product teams can have an ongoing relationship with their customers facilitated by user research professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for researchers to empower stakeholders to use the potential of unstructured customer data to interrogate underlying assumptions and make evidence-based decisions in lockstep with the fast pace of agile development processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way forward, towards a democratized approach to research, will require researchers to lead with the provision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-is-researchops/&quot;&gt;ResearchOps&lt;/a&gt;, research systems, and guidelines for best practice and benchmarking for their teams to follow and learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good researchers will open up their methodologies and educate their teams on what good research is (here’s a hint: it’s not just “having conversations.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enabling product managers, designers, engineers, and business operations people to better understand the purpose of research and how it’s conducted really helps,” says Lucy. “I think the best way to do that is to involve those key people in the research process, led by the researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new way to convey customer insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research knowledge becomes un-siloed, the goal is to increase the pace of research and make research accessible across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many organizations, traditional research work has typically followed the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders are involved at the beginning of a research project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They provide a brief with a set of questions they want answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researcher completes her work, she presents stakeholders with a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s a super inefficient way to learn about your customers,” says Lucy. “It’s tough to consume research in a long report format. You’re not able to continually guide the conversation to ensure stakeholders are getting the right insights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make research more accessible and less report-driven, we come to the idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt;—a central location or source of truth for all research insights and the evidence that backs them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current systems are too reliant on tribal knowledge, and researchers have become knowledge managers and librarians in their organizations, Lucy explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a researcher leaves, it’s really hard for designers, product managers, and business professionals within organizations to access knowledge, and I see the industry trying to figure out ways to make knowledge accessible to those roles—that’s what research repositories are aiming to do. There are a few different examples out there. It’s what Dovetail aims to do—to make research insights self-service so that if you were a designer and you wanted to learn about a particular topic, you could go to a place and search through what is already known.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changing the culture around research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research continues to have more impact in organizations, finding ways to make the outcomes of research more accessible for the people who use it—the decision-makers—is what the industry is working towards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s required to make this change, among other things, is a cultural shift away from researchers as siloed guardians of knowledge towards facilitators and enablers of research for their team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this doesn’t mean researchers will stand by and push stakeholders to drive the research process. As Lucy commented, “We’ve talked about product managers and designers running their own research, but of course, researchers still run research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though difficult to achieve, particularly in larger organizations, the benefits of enhanced connections between stakeholders and customers that democratization of research can bring will increasingly be the magic ingredient that defines the success of an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As technology becomes more table stakes, the differentiator for a product becomes related to design and customer insight,” explains Lucy. “It’s more and more important for these decision-makers to understand customers so they can create a product tailored to their needs. Otherwise, those customers will go somewhere else. I think these roles are looking to research to enable their decision-making. That’s where the benefit really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Art by &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/ben.jomo/?hl=en&quot;&gt;Ben Jomo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, illustrator.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[It’s official—we’re a great place to work!]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/great-place-to-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/great-place-to-work</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’re stoked to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatplacetowork.com.au/gptwcertified/dovetail/&quot;&gt;Great Place to Work&lt;/a&gt;® has recognized Dovetail as...you guessed it—a Great Place to Work®!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Place to Work is the global authority on workplace culture, employee experience, and the leadership behaviors proven to deliver market-leading revenue, employee retention, and increased innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Place to Work awards the certification based on an extensive and anonymous survey where an employer has to secure a score of 65 or more across all categories. We’re very proud to announce that we received an average score of 94!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’re chuffed, we’re not super surprised—everyone works so hard to maintain the culture that makes Dovetail such a great place to work—but still, it feels great to be recognized like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no easy feat to maintain a people-first culture when we’re scaling so quickly (we increased headcount by 65 percent last quarter), but the scores have confirmed our dedication to our people and culture is paying off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess you’re wondering how we did it. We think it has something to do with the following points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s good value&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, we live and breathe our values every day. Our founders made an intentional decision to wait before creating our company values so they would accurately reflect Dovetail’s existing culture rather than be ambitious, forced, top-down founder values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our values help us recognize and reward great work and give us a focal point to rally around. They’re the glue that holds everything together. That clarity and collective sense of purpose is a powerful driver of workplace satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;For the benefit of the team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies throw a bunch of benefits at their people as a major motivator. Our benefits aren’t usually the main reason people join, but they certainly help them stay on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone owns a slice of the business, no matter their role or seniority. We have plenty of great perks like a personal learning and development budget, dog-friendly office, bike racks, annual retreats, paid parental leave, heaps of great events, amazing beers on tap, loads of snacks, and goodies—the list goes on. We look after our people, and that’s reflected in the feedback we receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PLG from the inside out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people spend a third of their life working. More than clocking in and out, people seek purpose in their work and desire to have impact in their role. Many Dovetailers come from jobs where they’ve been frustrated or dissatisfied from working tirelessly towards a goal only to be stopped by bureaucracy or politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Dovetail, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.productled.org/foundations/what-is-product-led-growth&quot;&gt;product-led growth&lt;/a&gt; model means every last Dovetailer contributes to the business in a meaningful way. We emphasize efficiency and focus on shipping value and solving real customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no mistaking it; you can see the impact you’re having through the feedback loop with our customers who routinely say things like, “The day I was introduced to Dovetail, I cried internally” or “I don’t know what we’d do without it.” Even though we have great motivators in the form of equity, pay, and perks—contributing meaningfully to a product people absolutely love gives Dovetailers a sense of purpose and a reason to get out of bed. No matter how much money a business has to throw at workplace culture, that’s something that simply can’t be bought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balancing act&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get it, there’s life at work and life outside of work. We want everyone to be healthy, take holidays, get time to give back, and have the financial resources and support they need. There’s a line in one of our values to “remember the human behind the work.” We’ve built a culture around every Dovetailer being uniquely themselves and we cultivate an environment of flexibility and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all feel a sense of agency over our own time and feel comfortable structuring our workday in a way that allows us to experience success and purpose. We provide a couple of organization-wide extra paid break days each quarter called KitKat days. We believe that every Dovetailer should spend that day in whatever fashion they’d like, free from the fear of being behind on their work or letting anyone down because we are all offline at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All included&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want every Dovetailer to bring their whole self to work, so we’ve taken measures to be as inclusive as possible. Dovetail is a proud participant in Project F’s Program 50/50 diversity and inclusion initiative, which helps us identify and surface underlying systemic and environmental issues known to derail women in careers in technology. We built our parental leave policy on an inclusive framework of 12 weeks of equal paid leave to support new parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;W&lt;b&gt;hy we still believe in office culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have heard some rumblings about our world-class in-person office culture being the best way for our high-performing and creative team to nail it. It’s a bit of a spicy take to have in the current climate with such a heavy pivot to remote work, but we love our bright and shiny offices, celebrating wins together, and working on highly collaborative and truly cross-functional projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Come one, come all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been reading along, nodding that noggin of yours, why not start scrolling our careers page?

Finally, it got to the point where, instead of focusing on the actual content, I decided to try a plethora of tools and templates to help me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t that I didn’t know what to write. I didn’t have the right color palette or beautiful graphics (I’m not a designer, after all). So I tried notes, Notion, Miro, some obscure tools that no longer exist, and I downloaded an obscene number of Keynote and Google Slide templates. There was even a point where I &lt;i&gt;bought&lt;/i&gt; slide templates on Etsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the real problem was not the formatting, design, or aesthetic of my research reports—as much as I wished it was because that was a lot easier to solve than the real problem. I had no idea how to structure my research reports. I was constantly faced with writer’s block, staring at the blank pages, knowing that I had to present findings and the clock was ticking. Nothing is more complex than creating something from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of agonizing over reports, I finally started to find my rhythm and cadence. I unlocked the first step in adequately structuring research reports: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation/&quot;&gt;knowing your audience&lt;/a&gt;. Writing hundreds of reports has helped me see the main ways stakeholders like to ingest research information. Now, I use three primary templates, which speed up my process and allow the data to shine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Structure by research themes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and most common way of structuring reports is by themes. In this structure, you use what you learned from synthesis to guide how you write the report. But what exactly is a theme?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming/&quot;&gt;affinity diagramming&lt;/a&gt;, you will have clusters of information. For example, if I conducted a study on how people decide on where to travel next, I might see the following groups come up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiration from social media (Instagram, blogs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations from friends, family, or communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to a place you’ve been before and enjoyed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using package or vacation deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partner, spouse, or friend wanting to travel somewhere specific&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discounted trip finders &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing from a bucket list of destinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomly selecting a destination that sounds cool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, that is a lot to report on in and of itself! If I could help the team better understand this decision, I would focus on the top three to five themes with the highest number of participants. Let’s say I spoke to 20 people, and the top three decision-making factors were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiration from social media (Instagram, blogs)—17/20 participants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations from friends, family, or communities—14/20 participants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using discounted trip finders—13/20 participants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would use these three themes as the structure of my report, starting with the most common theme and ending with the least. Within the report, I would include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme title&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme summary, which includes bullet points of the main one to three findings within the theme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep dive section, including the insight behind the finding, quotes, videos, or audio clips of each finding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, this would then look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme title: Inspiration from social media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding one: People follow travel influencers on social media (e.g., Instagram and blogs) to constantly be up-to-date on where to travel next&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding two: People create lists, boards, or collections to save all the destinations they find from influencers or on social media and return to them when they want to travel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep dive into finding one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people love to daydream about travel, and there isn’t a better way to do that than getting lost on social media. Jake opens Instagram during work one day because he overheard a colleague talking about a recent trip. Jake knows he has some vacation days left, so he goes to his favorite Instagram travel accounts and starts scrolling. He remembers he started collecting a few places he’d like to go and looks through them, deciding on the top two. He makes a note to look up the prices later tonight, after work, and look into some potential dates. Although he wishes he could book the trip right then and there, it is too complicated to do during work, so he waits until later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I just got this travel bug suddenly after I heard some people talking, and as soon as I saw the photos on Instagram, I was like, I &lt;i&gt;have &lt;/i&gt;to go. I wish I could have just booked it immediately, but figuring out dates, airlines, hotels, and budget takes focus, so I just look into it when I have more time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following this structure, you can lay out the most important information you found for stakeholders to quickly get the most critical findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research goals and questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the theme template frequently for quite a few years, without deviating much. However, I still saw confusion at times with some stakeholders. With this structure, the answers to their questions or the research goals weren’t always straightforward. I then decided to try another format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of organizing the findings by themes gathered in clusters, I went straight to answering the research goals or questions aligned on at the beginning of the project. The incredible impact of this structure was that it directly answered what the stakeholders needed to know.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we take the example from above, let’s say the research goals were to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand people’s current mental models around deciding on where to travel to next &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover pain points behind deciding on where to travel &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify the tools people currently use when getting inspired and deciding on where to travel to next&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead of grouping by themes, I would structure it like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research goal one title&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding summary, which includes bullet points of the one to three findings relevant to the goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding one directly related to the research goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence of finding one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding two directly related to the research goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence of finding two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding three directly related to the research goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence of finding three&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way, the evidence you present is directly related to the study’s goals and the information stakeholders need to make decisions. Take a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://view.flodesk.com/pages/61487f63337f1c2aacf521ca&quot;&gt;sample UX research report template here&lt;/a&gt; (in exchange for your email, please)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usability testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I have found that usability testing is its own type of report and template. So I use one of the initial templates but then add a separate component that analyzes the usability aspect. Since it is slightly more manageable, I usually use the theme template to begin my usability test and then dive into the prototype findings. Still, I usually only highlight the top two themes to ensure the presentation isn’t too long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main difference here is the concept/prototype analysis section. There are a few ways to structure analysis when it comes to usability testing. The two main ways I have had success with are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screen-by-screen analysis, which includes a photo of the screen and annotations of feedback &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flow analysis, which includes bullet points of feedback &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are doing any quantitative usability testing, such as measuring time on task or task success, include a stoplight chart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way I decide whether to use screen-by-screen or flow analysis depends on the stakeholders’ needs and the depth of feedback I received from participants. For example, if I find that each screen received a lot of feedback, I will do that analysis. However, if the team needs to understand the flow of the prototype, I will break that up into several slides to demonstrate the feedback on the overall flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my usability testing reports are generally structured like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme title one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme summary, which includes bullet points of the main one to three findings within the theme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep dive section, including the insight behind the finding, quotes, videos, or audio clips of each finding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme title two&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme summary, which includes bullet points of the main one to three findings within the theme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deep dive slide, behind the finding, quotes, videos, or audio clips of each finding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concept/prototype analysis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminder of the prototype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screen-by-screen or flow analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If applicable, a rainbow chart &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three structures cover the most common reports/presentations you will encounter as a user researcher. I highly encourage you to try different approaches within these structures by always thinking of your audience first and gathering feedback after each presentation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you’re a Dovetail Analysis+Repository or Enterprise customer, you can make awesome-looking reports in Dovetail using Stories. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/guides/how-to-create-reports-dovetail/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Check out our guide for building beautiful reports here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to conduct user research in an agile environment]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-agile</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-agile</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;These days, everyone is into &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;speed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. How fast can we conduct research? How quickly can we get this new feature out to users? What are ways we can optimize processes to make them faster?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed is no stranger to user researchers. Many companies work in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/agile&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; or agile-adjacent environment where the team timeboxes their work into two-week sprints. This environment generally means research always needs to be ahead of schedule, which can be challenging—especially with poor communication or planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many of us work in this type of environment. When working on two-week sprints or similar frameworks, how do we ensure user research is part of the process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Four phases of research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we try to fit a square peg into a round hole, we must define the different types of user research. Once we clearly define our research categories for ourselves and others, we can see how they fit into the team’s timeframes and cadences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I split my research into four different phases or categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategic research &lt;/b&gt;encompasses generative research or problem-definition research that can help shape the company’s vision, goals, and innovation. Through this research, you can also better understand your user’s through deliverables such as personas, journey maps, or mental models. Ideally, you take on strategic research on overarching questions teams have once a quarter. These topics are typically spread across multiple teams and can impact the entire organization. Strategic research projects can take six to eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concept research &lt;/b&gt;helps ensure that teams are heading in the right direction with early ideas. You can show participants sketches of a concept or ask them to talk about a particular concept or idea. This type of research is lower in the funnel than strategic research. It can help teams prioritize what to work on next and help them create an experience aligned with the user’s mental models. Concept research can take up to four to six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluative research &lt;/b&gt;is about evaluating designs (namely prototypes) that help prove or disprove any assumptions and gathering feedback on initial designs and flows. This type of research can help uncover usability or accessibility issues and help the team understand if they are going in the right direction with specific designs. Evaluative research projects can take two to four weeks to complete. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maintenance research &lt;/b&gt;is all about monitoring and acting on ongoing feedback from users to measure the impact of the launched solutions. At the beginning of your study, you should aim to set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-metrics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;success criteria/metrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to show how successful or impactful the project was. During this research phase, you are taking in continuous feedback to see if additional research is needed. Maintenance research is ongoing but should be studied particularly two to four weeks after launch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have defined our research categories and timelines, we can better understand how these fit into the agile setup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Planning strategic research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should aim for one major strategic study per quarter (two, if you can!). This research occurs across all the sprints and is not tied to one particular sprint. Here are the steps for planning out this type of research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the quarter, hold a question-gathering workshop. In this workshop, gather all the questions teams have about users, inside and outside your product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a list of all the questions, put together similar ideas and present this list to the group in an&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/researching-right-thing-versus-researching-thing-right/&quot;&gt; impact x effort matrix&lt;/a&gt;. In this matrix, you will plot the finalized list of topics according to how impactful each is to the organization and user and how much effort each topic will take you (e.g. time to recruit niche participants)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you finalize the matrix, pick the most impactful and least effort projects. The rest will go into a backlog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already have backlogged topics in the next quarter, make sure to reprioritize them in case anything has changed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Planning concept research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concept research is one of the types of research that requires a lot of foresight and planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, these projects can take four to six weeks to complete and are typically tied to sprints. That means, if your team is working on two-week sprints, you need to know at least four weeks before research is “due” to have it ready in time. Here are the ways to plan for concept research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of each quarter, review the team’s backlog to see any viable projects for concept research. Put these projects in your backlog and make sure to start them four to six weeks before the sprint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet weekly with your teams to review the backlog and upcoming projects to ensure nothing has changed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a monthly rolling research program to have a constant space set up for concept tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For last-minute concept tests, consider unmoderated approaches or a quantitative method, such as surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your team can’t or doesn’t plan far enough ahead, it’s okay. In this case, you can incorporate strategic research and evaluative research instead of concept research. In between studies, take the time to educate teams on concept research and how it can benefit them to plan for this kind of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Planning evaluative research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you can conduct evaluative research quickly (two to four weeks), it is the most popular type of research to incorporate into an agile environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have never done user research in an agile framework, I recommend starting here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluative research is always tied to a sprint because you evaluate a design that your team will implement (fully or partially) during the next sprint. Since you can do evaluative research in two weeks, that means you have to be two weeks ahead of each sprint necessitating evaluative research. For example, if the team will develop a feature in sprint two, you need to start researching that feature during sprint one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how you can plan evaluative research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the above, at the beginning of each quarter, review the team’s backlog to see viable projects for evaluative research. Put these projects in your backlog and make sure to start research two to four weeks before the sprint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet weekly with your designer(s) to see upcoming work they need to have tested. Align this with the projects you identified at the beginning of the quarter and put it into your backlog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet weekly with your product manager (it can be the same meeting) to discuss any changes or upcoming projects that need evaluative research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If presented with last-minute evaluative research, consider an unmoderated approach that can run over a weekend and deliver faster results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, you can also conduct evaluative research &lt;i&gt;during &lt;/i&gt;the first week of a sprint. This concept is similar to design sprints, where you create a prototype (based on previous research), test it, deliver results, and iterate all in five days. While you can do this, it takes a lot of coordination, and I always recommend doing as much evaluative research before the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Planning maintenance research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing maintenance research should ensure that anything the team launched aligns with the user’s needs and expectations. This is how I plan and continue to work with maintenance research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define success criteria and metrics for a project upfront. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this on your own, meet with a product manager and/or data/product analyst to help you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before launch, meet with your product manager and/or data/product analyst to set up ways you will measure the success criteria. Some widespread feedback measurements include reviews, comments, customer support tickets, A/B tests, or satisfaction surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two to four weeks after launch, keep a close eye on the defined measurements. If something needs more attention or research, flag it to the team to discuss in the following sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adapting user research to agile&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When thinking about adapting user research to an agile framework, we need to do as much as possible to make the two compatible. Here are some additional ways to make user research successful in this environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/five-things-create-strong-research-culture/&quot;&gt;Create a research roadmap and backlog&lt;/a&gt; for visibility of your work and to help align with product roadmaps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timebox your work into similar chunks within sprints. For example, recruitment takes two days, planning takes three days, and conducting takes three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have one or two days of a sprint be research days where for half the day, team members are present in research sessions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deliver concise reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that allow stakeholders to ingest information effectively and efficiently (video clips!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider starting a participant panel to make the time-intensive process of recruitment easier, enabling you to conduct research on a shorter timeline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do you conduct user research in an agile workplace?

They’re extra days of paid leave for the whole company so that everyone can—you guessed it—take a break!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just after the first lockdown here in Australia, as restrictions began to ease, we noticed our team had caught a serious case of lockdown fatigue. People hadn’t been taking leave, daily video conferencing was wearing everyone thin, and all this combined with the past months of heavy restrictions on people’s movement meant our people were in danger of burning out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, last year, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruok.org.au/&quot;&gt;RUOK? Day&lt;/a&gt;, we introduced KitKat days to allow the whole company to switch off together (yes, that even means shutting off Slack). We wanted everyone to really feel permission to unwind and not think about work for the day. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/careers/&quot;&gt;we have tons of great benefits at Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, I have to say, KitKat days are fast becoming a company favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So why are they everyone’s favorite benefit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so I can’t speak for everyone, but I love KitKat days because of the emphasis it places on people’s mental well-being. Also, beyond allowing everyone to recharge their batteries and get their work-life balance in order, a day off goes a long way in thanking each person for their hard work throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we launched the program, we’ve given our team 12 KitKat days, and we’ve since introduced KitKat afternoons on Fridays where everyone finishes up at 3 pm to kick off their weekends early. Often, we’ll combine a KitKat day with a public holiday weekend just to give our team that extra bit of time off, and we usually have a handful of KitKat days every quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more—we give KitKat days to all our employees over the Christmas break—that way, when we close the office down, no one has to take forced leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the team get up to on their KitKat day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I said I couldn’t speak for everyone about why we love KitKat days—but I can &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; you. In the video below, you’ll see our team taking advantage of their day off to pursue a wild diversity of interesting hobbies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like fun, doesn’t it? If you like what you see, why not mosey on over to our careers page and apply for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/careers/&quot;&gt;one of our many open positions&lt;/a&gt;? Maybe next KitKat day, you can take a break, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Selling software in the era of the end user]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/product-led-growth-plg-selling-software-end-user-era</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/product-led-growth-plg-selling-software-end-user-era</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple decades, the consumerization of enterprise software has produced a new breed of vendors who have quickly supplanted their traditional counterparts. In the early days, pioneers in the field like Oracle and SAP would sell software to a small number of IT managers or executives, who had little consideration for the user experience of the end users who would have to use such software. This software was expensive to build and buy, had involved lengthy sales cycles, and the end users had no say in their use of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a new class of software has emerged, championed by companies like Slack, Dropbox, Airtable, and more recently Notion. These products have adopted the user experience patterns and qualities pioneered in consumer software developed by Apple and social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. We’ve seen concepts born in the consumer space, such as emojis, reactions, and hashtags, as well as the viral loops these platforms employ to keep their users engaged, make their way into business software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives in this new breed of company have moved away from revenue to report &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/intl/en-au/blog/news/slack-has-10-million-daily-active-users&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;active usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, just like their consumer counterparts. The newfound familiarity and intuitiveness of business software has meant that buyers now spend less time and energy on training and onboarding. Instead of IT managers and executives pushing software from the top down, end users are now demanding that enterprises adopt this new class of software to help them be more effective in their roles. This entire motion is driven by the quality, intuitiveness, and consumer-appeal of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift has been a boon for user experience and design practitioners. When I started out my career in product design, the transition towards a consumer-standard for business software was starting to manifest in design circles. While working at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, the organization commenced a multi-year journey to transform their core business of on-premise software, usually deployed and managed by an IT admin, to a cloud-first platform that could be tried and adopted by anyone. The bet was to expand beyond the technical base of developers where Atlassian had seen initial adoption, to non-technical teams across marketing, legal, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support this, Jira—a decade-old tool lovingly reviled by many—was undergoing a radical redesign, leveraging many elements found in consumer software, to make itself more approachable and appealing for the masses. This quest also saw the $425M acquisition of Trello, a tool that had fully embraced consumerization. In Trello, a playful illustrated mascot of the co-founder’s Siberian Husky, named Taco, follows you around the product as you decorate your kanban board with illustrated stickers, GIFs, and photos—something that would be at home on Facebook or Instagram, but totally unknown to conventional business software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I later went on to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;, a company which had grown up in this consumerized world. They were increasingly becoming industry-recognized as they deployed design and user experience to aggressively land emerging startups and challenge incumbents like Zendesk and HubSpot. Intercom had effectively transformed the cold, robotic, and impersonal experiences of live chat and customer support into a more authentic and personal experience that delivered on newly raised user expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others took note and new startups were seemingly popping up every other week with inspired takes on the live chat category. Live chat had effectively become commoditized as everyone sought to replicate this new customer standard. Meanwhile, Intercom was scaling up sales, moving upmarket, and revising pricing and packaging in a bid to fuel continued growth. Intercom was starting to lose its shine in the industry as it lost out to startups who pursued aggressive freemium pricing and go-to-market motions, and to new entrants such as Drift who focused exclusively on the live chat for sales category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With end users now more empowered than ever to influence and decide the software they use day-to-day, their consumer expectations have naturally translated into how they expect to try and buy business software. In recent years, this buying motion has been heralded as &lt;a href=&quot;https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product-led growth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or ‘PLG’. Championed largely by the venture community and the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openviewpartners.com/blog/what-is-product-led-growth&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenView who have dubbed this the “end user era”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PLG describes a distribution model that is focused on solving end user challenges, with the elimination of any friction for these users to get value from the product as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practically what this translates to for most PLG models is an effortless free trial or free offering, transparent and clear pricing, intuitive onboarding and a clear path to value, a self-service support experience backed by a community of users, and an ecommerce checkout flow with no sales conversation. These PLG tactics were pioneered by Atlassian early on to drive adoption among developers, famously with no sales team (but don’t believe what you read; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openviewpartners.com/blog/product-led-sales/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Atlassian does now have a sales team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Atlassian’s recent investments in the consumer experience should be seen as a doubling down of the ingredients that saw initial success with developers to other non-technical markets. In fact, this trend was called out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650372/000155837015001685/filename1.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Atlassian’s S-1 filing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at IPO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the “bring your own device” trend, employees are increasingly empowered to “bring your own software”, leading to the user-driven viral adoption of new types of consumer-style software products within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Intercom, despite having the qualities of a consumer experience, the shift to move more upmarket, with increased focus on sales and opaque pricing translated into additional friction for buyers and created a vacuum for challengers to emerge with more aggressive self-service go-to-market motions that fully embraced the principles of PLG. I reflect on my two experiences at Atlassian and Intercom to emphasize that it simply isn’t enough to build a consumer-grade experience, the way that product is sold and distributed needs to also match consumer expectations to properly embark on a successful PLG motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PLG motion is what we’re seeing play out here at Dovetail. Our customers are experienced user researchers and user experience practitioners—how they do their work, and the tools and processes they employ is entirely in their purview. They’re not experienced software buyers or procurement professionals, they’re just looking for a tool to help them be more effective in their role. Our customers will sign up for a free trial, give Dovetail a go, and see if they find value. This all happens without a sales conversation; no barriers to starting a trial, no lead capture forms, and no “talk to sales” or “book a demo” prompts. Customers will make the decision to try and buy Dovetail entirely without us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave the sales function at Dovetail? More often than not, those looking to buy Dovetail often work in enterprise organizations and Fortune 500 companies. These individuals are experienced in their craft and can effectively evaluate whether Dovetail meets their needs, but they’re inexperienced in navigating the complexity and bureaucracy of purchasing software within their organization. The organizations have complex procurement processes that might involve proof of concepts, wider stakeholder buy-in, detailed security and risk assessments, and complex contracting discussions with their legal and sourcing departments. The intent of these individuals is to introduce new transformational software into their organization, and instead they find themselves running the gauntlet through their internal organizational process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we’ve seen that the majority of our “selling” effort, if you could call it that, is spent equipping these informed—but unsophisticated—buyers with the tools and materials to help them navigate the complexities and red tape of purchasing software in their organizations. Instead of pitching to uninformed customers and convincing them to sign up, we focus on understanding what our prospective customers’ purchasing process looks like, and how we can best support them through it. In effect, the ‘sales team’ at Dovetail act as consultative partners who are working to accelerate the bottom-up self-service adoption within complex enterprise purchasing environments. Once we land a customer, and as a customer uncovers more value over time and continues to grow with us, any subsequent conversations concerning expansion are efficient and painless both for the customer and for our sales team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my next article, I’ll share and unpack some of the tactical activities and strategies we’re employing to help support our prospective customers on this journey to adopt Dovetail within their organization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Talking tagging taxonomies with a live panel]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/community-panel-tagging-taxonomies</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/community-panel-tagging-taxonomies</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building and maintaining tagging taxonomies, there are different strokes for different folks. It depends on what type of research you’re doing, what your team looks like, and the timeframe you’re working within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no &lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;way to do things, we opened the floor to the community. So we held a live panel of researchers and had them give us the lowdown on their approach to tagging taxonomies. And guess what? Each researcher goes about tagging differently. That’s why it’s so important for anyone looking to become the next tagging guru to get exposed to as many styles and methods as possible, so they can choose an approach that suits them best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording below showcases a panel of researchers, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-agnew/&quot;&gt;Katherine Agnew, Senior UX Researcher at Gartner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/markfishmanresearch/&quot;&gt;Mark Fishman, User Researcher at Whisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/melaniemauller/&quot;&gt;Melanie Mauller, UX Researcher at Vertex Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/samaher/&quot;&gt;Samaher Ramzan, UX Researcher at 1Password&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To really cement the notion that there’s no &lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;way to do things, we spoke to three researchers from the same organization, Atlassian, to give us their opinions on tagging taxonomies. And guess what? Each researcher is different!  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording below showcases a panel of researchers, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chmccurrie/&quot;&gt;Caitlin McCurrie, Ph.D., Lead Researcher at Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyceslee/&quot;&gt;Joyce Lee, Senior Researcher at Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccasareff/&quot;&gt;Bec Sareff-Hibbert, User Researcher at Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to continue the discussion about tagging taxonomies, make sure you join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dovetail Slack community&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Liz Ross, Content Lead, Dovetail. &lt;/b&gt;With a decade of experience in the field of Marketing, Liz has developed a focus on customer-centric strategic content.

We look up in the clouds and recognize faces and animals. We always look at the clock at a particular time and start to attribute meaning to that number. We love to make meaning, even where no meaning exists. Keeping this in mind, how do we ensure that we aren&amp;#39;t chasing specific answers when conducting our research sessions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can attend training courses to help negate biases and learn about unbiased experimental research design. However, this can be incredibly time-consuming and might not be doable in a pinch, especially if you are not a trained user researcher. When you lack time, expertise, and resources, it can be challenging to create an unbiased study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenging, but not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Minimum viable research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of us are aware of the MVP: the minimum viable product. We build this version to lean out the development process and include only the essential features to test out the idea. We can apply this same idea to research while keeping our studies sound and unbiased. This concept is beneficial if you are not a trained user researcher and are conducting research yourself. It leaves you with a simple research design that helps you avoid the pitfall of confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating an unbiased MVR plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plan is the best place to start to ensure your following research study is lean and unbiased. This MVR plan is a stripped-down version of my standard research plan, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_2S5c-LWhwEk86oMxemgwsYHcm6CG_rwut5TLz0byY/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;check out the template&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you want to include more detail. There are several steps to take and components to create a minimum viable research plan. Following this guide will help you build a research plan that is both lean and neutral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;List out hypotheses/assumptions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hold a lot of biases in our heads, whether we like it or not. Since we are human, there is no way we can make our prejudices disappear to conduct one hundred percent pure research. We can, however, take steps to make ourselves more aware of those assumptions we hold so that they are less likely to lead us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you get started on research problems and questions, sit down with whomever is involved in the research project and list all of your hypotheses, assumptions, and biases about the project, idea, and participants. With this exercise, you take the thoughts in your head and put them down on paper, making them more widely known and forcing you to be aware of them. Keep this list with you when writing your research plan and during analysis, as it can help keep the group in check.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reframe a business question to a user research problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a user researcher, colleagues come to me to request user research with a plethora of questions or problems. Unfortunately, often these requests revolve around the business rather than user needs or problems. Starting a research project based on a business question or concern could lead to some issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical example of this happens when a colleague comes to me with a problem like, &amp;quot;people are purchasing once from our platform and then never coming back, or deleting the app. Can we find how to make people purchase more?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a big problem! Retention, customer lifetime value, app download rate, revenue are all crucial metrics impacted by this issue. However, does the user care about these metrics? No. But how do you pivot these business problems into user research problems? Ask yourself: &amp;quot;How does this problem impact the user?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the example above, you could hypothesize that the user is:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not satisfied with the initial purchase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t need to purchase more than once &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app is not solving a problem for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase flow was too difficult&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, you could turn the business issue into the following research study: understand the process people go through when purchasing from our app and find any problems or pain points they may be encountering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, instead of simply asking participants how they would purchase more, we can dive into the reasons why they are using the app in the first place and why they are not coming back. This approach will give you much more robust and informative qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create research goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research goals are a step further than the research question or problem you are exploring. These goals should address HOW we are going to study the problem statement. We do this by breaking the research problem down into several objectives. Here is the two-step process you can use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself: &amp;quot;What am I trying to learn?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what must the research achieve?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify the stage of the product development phase, such as a general idea or topic (generative research) or a prototype or concept (evaluative research)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I am trying to learn:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to understand the process people go through when purchasing from our app and find any problems or pain points they may be encountering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement is broad, and we need to break it down to what we want to learn about that problem statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do people currently decide to purchase with us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do they choose to buy from us; who else is involved; when do they buy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What tools do they use to make a purchase?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do they feel about the current purchase process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What problems do they encounter when trying to make a purchase?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What improvements would they make to the current purchasing process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are you researching?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what exactly we are researching will also help you hone your research objectives. There are three main buckets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A topic or idea: we need to understand the process people are currently going through (generative research)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concept or prototype: we need to uncover what people think about the prototype and how they expect to use it (generative + usability testing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live code: we need to evaluate the performance of the product and what people think about it (usability testing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These will change your objectives slightly to know whether you are focused on understanding an overall topic/idea, uncovering what people expect from a product, or evaluating product performance. A usability test is far different from generative research, so it is essential to know what type of research you are doing, as it helps us understand what we can expect to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have brainstormed the above, you can start writing goals! Each project generally has three goals that narrow in on exactly what you want to be researching. Follow these models for the most common types of objectives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover people&amp;#39;s current processes/decision-making about [research subject], and how they feel about the overall experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about people&amp;#39;s current pain points, frustrations, and barriers about [existing process/current tools] and how they would improve it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncover the current tools people use to [achieve goal] and their experience with those tools. Uncover how they would improve those tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand what [research subject] means to people (how they define it) and why it is important to them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluate how people are using a [product/website/app/ service ] &lt;b&gt;OR&lt;/b&gt; Evaluate how people are currently interacting with a [product/ website/app/service &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Write neutral interview questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your research goals sorted, writing questions becomes a bit easier. Ideally, you write research questions that align with and help you answer each goal. Your questions should be able to give you insights that answer your objectives. So when you ask a participant a question, it is ultimately answering one of the objectives. You can start by turning each objective into 3–5 questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, before you get started writing any old question, there are ways to keep your phrasing as neutral and unbiased as possible. One of the best ways to write fair questions is to keep them open-ended and not use subjective words. If you are getting stuck with writing questions, you can use the TEDW framework:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;T &lt;/b&gt;= &amp;quot;Tell me more...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Take me through...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; = &amp;quot;Explain why...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Explain how...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; = &amp;quot;Describe why...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Describe how...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt; = &amp;quot;Walk me through...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, instead of: &amp;quot;Were you upset when you couldn&amp;#39;t purchase X or Y?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, you can ask: &amp;quot;Explain how you felt when you couldn&amp;#39;t purchase X or Y.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of: &amp;quot;When did you last purchase on our app?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can ask: &amp;quot;Tell me about the last time you purchased something on our app.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of: &amp;quot;How happy/satisfied are you when using our app?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can ask: &amp;quot;Describe how you feel while using our app.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using this method, you ask open-ended conversation-starting questions that give you rich, qualitative data and avoid leading or biasing the user to answer in a specific way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyze via research goals rather than outcomes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rut I see many colleagues get stuck in is during analysis. During that stage, people are looking for answers to what they are hoping to find. I&amp;#39;ve done it too! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than analyzing the qualitative data by expected (or hoped for) outcomes, use the goals you defined above. By looking at the research through the lens of the goals, you are less likely to pick out what you want to hear. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;affinity diagrams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to analyze in this way. Also, don&amp;#39;t forget to keep that list of assumptions and biases next to you while analyzing the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following these lean steps can help lead to rich and helpful data, leading your team in a better direction—and without breaking the bank or timeline!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

Together, we drilled down on her practice with a couple of questions relating to tagging and taxonomies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this session, we’ll be chatting to Laura about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a tagging taxonomy means to her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How she goes about building her taxonomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How she structures her data for efficiency during analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What level of granularity she uses when tagging &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How she tackles onboarding and collaboration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advice and wisdom for creating a taxonomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for something to read? You’re in luck—check out these key quotes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A matter of categorization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, a tagging taxonomy is about creating analysis categories. I once read the following analogy in a book, and I thought it was a brilliant metaphor to explain analysis categories. Imagine you have a trunk full of toys and they’re all mixed. You have balls, dolls, cars, construction sets, et cetera. And you’re asked to rearrange the toys into buckets and categorize them. So a bucket can be dolls, a bucket can be balls, a bucket can be construction sets. And then, you take all the mixed toys, and you separate them into a corresponding bucket. That’s what you’re doing when you’re analyzing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have mixed data, and you’re taking bits and pieces of it and clustering it into categories that make sense to analyze later. The categories can vary a lot. With balls, for example, you can have individual sports and team sports, and that’s how you arrange them. The level of granularity is up to you. It depends on what you’re trying to find out through your research questions. You’re trying to break data into small, manageable chunks that fit into a category that you previously defined as the object of your study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a taxonomy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start with a top-down approach, where we have a set of predefined categories, but they’re not set in stone. Once I have our data, I let it speak to me. After we tag a specific category, there might be a tag we didn’t use because it didn’t talk to the data, which we will delete. If we see the data reveal something we didn&amp;#39;t anticipate or didn’t have in our taxonomy, we create a tag. So we use a mix of both the top-down and bottom-up approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Structuring your data for efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I have a vast data set with participants from different industries, I’ll create different note boards divided by industry. If I have different roles and companies, I’ll also create different note groups by role. I do very granular filtering afterward. This way, I have the right context and know that certain data sets belong to a particular industry or role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tagging as a team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, I’ll create a taxonomy because I’m the research owner of that project, and then I’ll have a couple of onboarding sessions with the team. I’ll show them the research objectives, the script or whatever we’re doing, and the taxonomy. Then we’ll brainstorm together and chat about anything missing or how things are grouped into tag groups. Typically one session isn’t enough, though. After the first session, everything might seem very clear, and everyone’s happy and onboard. Then when they have the data in front of them, they panic; they’re unsure how to tag it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s very, very tricky, and there are always doubts. Always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll tag about half an interview in a group session so that the team can watch how I do it. Then they’ll ask questions and start tagging their own interviews. We’ll also create a Slack channel for the project. When it comes to tag duplication, we have a rule that every time you create a new tag, you have to say it in the Slack channel because then the others know that if they see data that matches that tag, then that tag is already created and they don’t need to duplicate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Perfection is the enemy of getting things done&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always say it doesn’t have to be perfect; it just doesn’t. Done is always better than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Dovetail helps a lot in that sense. All the content is searchable, so you can always go back to it even if you miss something. Having a deadline also helps. In our industry, we work within short time frames and don’t have the luxury of sitting on things because we feel paralyzed. We also work as a team and support each other a lot. We’re working together most of the time, or if we have individual tasks, we’ll regroup and share what we’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tagging taxonomies are one of the most discussed topics in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dovetail’s Slack community&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, you can continue the discussion there with over 2,700 other Dovetailers.

One friend mentioned their team was trying to assess a redesign. They had done a lot of testing to compare the original design with the new (and improved!) one, but they wanted to know if people &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; the new design more than the old one. It turns out, the majority of people &lt;i&gt;preferred &lt;/i&gt;the old design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this happens a lot. For example, I worked on a similar redesign for an app and participants mentioned they preferred the outdated 90s-style design rather than the more modern elements we thought would be a hit. My friend was at her wit’s end already having invested a lot of time and effort into the process. Should they revert to the old design and scrap the whole project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with preference&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preference is a slippery concept, and measuring user preference is like hanging on to a fish. You might get it for a second, but it will soon disappear from your grasp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with preference is that it is hugely subjective. For example, if I asked you if you prefer chocolate or vanilla ice cream, you could likely tell me which one you like more. Or if I asked if you liked winter or summer more, you might have an answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why? I much prefer vanilla ice cream to chocolate. I like the taste much more, as well as the consistency. And I love summer because I always tend to be cold and love walking outside in nature. On the other hand, you might like vanilla ice cream because it reminds you of a specific childhood memory, and you may like summer more because you love to swim outside. The problem with preference is that so many confounding variables go into a given answer, producing widely varied responses across individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t be able to account and design for preferences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when we ask participants what they prefer design-wise, they might be able to tell you, but we also might be forcing them into an unlikely situation. For example, how many times have you landed on a website, and they’ve asked you, “Would you like to view the website with a blue or purple background today?” Or, “would you like the banner to be an image that spans across the screen, or an image in a box, accompanied by text today?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People aren’t used to making these decisions. One person might prefer a huge image banner with text overlayed on top of that, but it will likely be an accessibility nightmare. When we ask participants what they prefer, they might choose, but we can’t be sure why they made that choice or if it doesn’t violate any heuristics or design needs for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instead, measure usability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve knocked preference off your to-do list, what should you be doing instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used an ugly app or website? Something that was just so outdated or weird-looking but just &lt;i&gt;worked&lt;/i&gt;? Despite the ugliness, you could quickly get in and out of it and achieve whatever goal you needed to get done. Have you ever used Amazon? I am not saying Amazon is ugly, but they certainly haven’t modernized it. Why has Amazon been able to get away with the same general design for so long? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it is &lt;i&gt;usable&lt;/i&gt;, and we, as humans, use products that help us achieve our goals, not because they are beautiful (with some exceptions, of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs for humans, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/theory-user-delight/#:~:text=Aarron%20Walter%2C%20in%20his%20book,that%20closely%20mirrors%20Maslow&apos;s%20hierarchy.&amp;text=Only%20when%20a%20product%20is,enjoyable%20aspects%20of%20the%20experience.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;there is a hierarchy of needs for users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron Walter created this hierarchy, and it stands true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before anything, a product needs to have a function. If you create something with no value or purpose, no one will feel compelled to use it (let’s refer back to Heinz’s purple ketchup or Segways).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, it has to be reliable. If a website or app keeps crashing or something we are using continues to break, we will move away from that product to find a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we come to usable. If the product is impossible to learn or use, we will abandon it to find something more manageable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is pleasurable. If the product hits on the above needs, people can appreciate the aesthetics or delightful aspects of the experience. People can only notice a beautifully redesigned product if it is first usable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cornerstones of usability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on preference in your next test, focus on the usability of the product. During usability testing, you should focus on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency—how quickly people can complete tasks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness—whether or not people can achieve their necessary tasks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satisfaction*—how people feel about the usability of your product &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By measuring these three usability aspects, you can benchmark your current design and compare the new design. If your latest experience is more efficient and effective than the old one, it is a good bet that more people will use your product or stay with your product for longer (hitting on acquisition and retention metrics!). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;i&gt;One quick note on satisfaction when it comes to usability. A lot of companies ask users how satisfied they are with a particular product. This is different from satisfaction when it comes to usability. When you measure satisfaction within the context of usability, it is about whether or not the user found the usability satisfactory, not the product. An excellent resource for this is the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usabilitygeek.com/how-to-use-the-system-usability-scale-sus-to-evaluate-the-usability-of-your-website/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;System Usability Scale&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; (test-level satisfaction) or the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/measuring-perceived-usability/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Single-Ease Questionnaire&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; (task-level satisfaction).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Still struggling with a redesign?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if your product is functional, reliable, and usable, but people still hate your new design? I highly recommend that you read about the status quo bias. This bias causes us, humans, to prefer how things currently are and when things change from that baseline, we perceive this as a loss. We don’t like change, and seeing change impacts our ability to make sound decisions, which is why people might choose an outdated design over a new, sleek one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;eBay did a great job of overcoming this bias. &lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.uie.com/death_of_relaunch/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;They changed their yellow background to white, and complaints flooded in&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so much so that they reverted to the old color. Then, slowly, over a few months, they changed the color from yellow to white, without any complaints. If you consider a more usable redesign, gradually making changes might be a great happy middle ground for your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you struggled launching new designs for your customers? Is preference something that comes up a lot in your research?

A significant part of anthropology is understanding different cultures through direct observation and participation. An anthropologist must avoid imposing their cultural perspectives on a new culture or risk compromising the reliability of their results. This experience has taught me to look at what the data is &lt;i&gt;showing me&lt;/i&gt; instead of forcing my perspective on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve since learned to adapt my approach to taxonomies to applied research and UX. What I’ve realized is that it’s often necessary to build different taxonomies, depending on the outcomes of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article will touch on what a good taxonomy looks like, cover my strategies for building a taxonomy, and explain how to create different taxonomies depending on the research goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What makes a good taxonomy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good taxonomy breaks down your data into components that can be used to synthesize insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a less helpful taxonomy labels or categorizes data (describing) rather than looking beneath the hood to see what’s really going on (analysis). In this way, it doesn’t reveal anything new about the data other than what you knew before you started tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tags vs. fields&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between analysis and description also means that tags are fundamentally different from fields. While tags analyze the content of your data, fields describe the data source itself and provide context around it. Similarly, this separates your project-level tags from your global tags in Dovetail. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/global-project-tags-taxonomy-research-repository/&quot;&gt;I use global tags to organize my data but not to analyze it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fields also supercharge your analysis, and they’re one of the things that make Dovetail so much more potent than an affinity sort. Using fields means that I can re-filter my data over time and get new perspectives on the same analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of fields I add to describe my participants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;product&lt;/b&gt; they are using. This helps me organize who my insights are most relevant for in my team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;b&gt;organization size.&lt;/b&gt; This might affect the needs that the participant has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;b&gt;role.&lt;/b&gt; This helps me understand the participant’s context and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building your taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can make taxonomies in many different ways, but building the wrong taxonomy is a quick and easy way to bake &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/confirmation-bias&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roughly, there are two kinds of taxonomies—bottom-up and top-down.&lt;/b&gt; These are defined by whether you create from the ground up or come with a pre-made taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My strategy for building a taxonomy changes based on the research project’s goals and the level of ambiguity within the research area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is more ambiguity in the research area, I focus on building my taxonomy from the bottom-up, solidly grounding it in the data. An example might be a project in a new area where we don’t currently understand the user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if I already have a solid understanding (for example, from a previous research project), I can apply a top-down method. I use this approach when analyzing customer feedback in an area where we have already conducted contextual research and identified user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between bottom-up and top-down taxonomies roughly matches the stage of the design lifecycle I’m supporting with my research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative research involves much more ambiguity, and my goals revolve around discovery and exploration. As such, when I start in a new area with generative research, I’ll adopt a bottom-up strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we get to evaluating an existing feature or product, I can adapt a taxonomy I created earlier in the design process. I can do this confidently as there is less uncertainty, and we have already identified the user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Caution&lt;/b&gt;—it’s easy to overestimate our knowledge. For this reason, when thinking about how much I already know, I consciously nudge my answer towards the side of being less confident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions I use to figure out what strategy I’m going to use to build my taxonomy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: &lt;/b&gt;What part of the design process are you supporting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action: &lt;/b&gt;If I’m working in early Discovery phases, I’ll adopt a bottom-up approach. If we’re closer to evaluation, my approach will be more top-down or a mix of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: &lt;/b&gt;How much ambiguity is there in the research area already, and how much do we already know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action: &lt;/b&gt;It’s easy to bake confirmation bias into your results by building a taxonomy based on assumptions and previous misconceptions.  Ask yourself how much certainty you have in the topic area, then take that answer and then nudge it a bit more to the uncertainty category. You can also do an assumption mapping exercise individually or with your product team, and rate your confidence in each assumption to make this explicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: &lt;/b&gt;What’s the depth of the project, and what’s the desired outcome? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action: &lt;/b&gt;Building a bottom-up taxonomy is rewarding, but it’s also time-consuming. Not every project needs the depth or richness that this approach provides. I moderate my strategy based on the goals of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: &lt;/b&gt;Are the research questions quantitative or qualitative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action: &lt;/b&gt;Using a taxonomy to quantify your research is a very different beast from using it as a qualitative analysis tool. If you’re planning on quantifying your tags, you should factor this into your strategy from the start. I go into more detail about quantifying tags below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building a bottom-up taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strengths&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideal for supporting exploration and discovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firmly grounded in the data, helping you find new insights and user needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helps to minimize confirmation bias by creating a new taxonomy suited to the data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Needs to be adapted before reusing between projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time-consuming to create&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not quantifiable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start tagging from scratch.&lt;/b&gt; Go for a swim in your data. Really immerse yourself in it. You’ll start to notice patterns, which become tags organically. Your tags will start as relatively high-level, fuzzy, and broad. Keep separate tags for intriguing things you don’t understand yet (to break down later) and critical quotes to return to when writing your report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evolve and add.&lt;/b&gt; In between each transcript, go back and prune your board. As more tags emerge, you might realize that you can apply them to notes you have already analyzed. You might also merge redundant tags or split apart tags that contain more than one idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regroup the tags.&lt;/b&gt; Go through the process of regrouping tags a few times. Consider whether you should move tags into other groups. These groups can become headings in your report later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optimize for insights.&lt;/b&gt; As you do multiple passes, your tags start getting more and more defined and turn into insights. That’s when you know it’s ready to come out of the oven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process creates a taxonomy that’s tailor-made to help you make meaning out of a previously chaotic bucket of data. Because these taxonomies are made-to-measure, reusing them can be risky:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some risks with reusing taxonomies:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The taxonomy becomes static over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is tagged too generally to fit the pre-existing taxonomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not adding tags when the opportunity arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorrectly applying a taxonomy to a project where there is less than ideal fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forcing new data into a system made for a different context or topic is like using a cookie cutter and throwing away the scraps of cookie dough. You’re forcing the data into a different shape, which gives you misleading insights and risks missing new ideas. That said, if you’re starting a project in the same area, you can use your existing taxonomy as a starting point as long as you stay flexible enough to spot new insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building a top-down taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strengths&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusable between projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quicker to create&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can be quantified&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weaknesses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn’t ideal for discovering new needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less grounded in the specific data set being analyzed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More prone to confirmation bias&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, working with a top-down taxonomy always makes me nervous. But it probably should—you’re essentially applying a set of assumptions to unfamiliar data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are times when it’s handy to have this strategy in your toolkit because the richness of your taxonomy should match the richness of your data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, when you’re tagging a large volume of data that’s not particularly rich (like short pieces of feedback), your goals might be to quantify the themes within the dataset rather than discovering new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best in this situation to use a randomized sample from your data set, create a bottom-up taxonomy, and then use that to tag the rest of your data. However, you might base your top-down taxonomy on existing knowledge, like your prior research or other research you can access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using a top-down taxonomy, it’s even more important to be open to revising your taxonomy. I nudge myself in this direction by adding a tag at the beginning of my analysis for data that doesn’t fit into my existing tags. I can use this as I go, and it removes some of the temptation to force my data into my existing taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quantifying tags&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with your research goals, the tagging strategy you’ve chosen will determine whether it makes sense to quantify your tags. If your research goals were generative, it’s not productive to quantify your tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantifying tags creates a summary by reducing your data to a number. Generative research aims to create depth and richness, which a summary does not serve. However, quantifying your tags is appropriate where your research goals were to measure a trend in your data (i.e., ‘how many’ ‘how much’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantifying your tags also requires that you’ve been deliberate and consistent about the definitions and boundaries between your tags. This means you can’t be as organic and flexible with them (the ideal when tagging qualitatively). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you’ve been consistent and deliberate about defining your tags, and your data set is big enough, it can be useful to quantify your tags to create a summary of the broader trends within your data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tagging as a team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tagging your data as a team is a great way to create alignment and benefit from the perspectives of others in your team. However, it’s easy for two people to interpret a title of a tag differently. Once you involve other brains in your analysis, it becomes essential to understand and use your tags consistently. This is especially important if you’re quantifying your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the process I use when tagging with other researchers or with my product team:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get together in a room or on a call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a sample of the data to build a bottom-up taxonomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete a couple of transcripts together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify what we’re learning from it and brainstorm the themes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a shared tagging system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively write the definitions of those tags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a large quantity of data or limited time, split up the remaining transcripts across the team and tackle them individually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have time, review how you’ve each used the taxonomy as a team to make sure you’re staying consistent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Variety is the spice of life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a variety of strategies ready for building a taxonomy is a great way to level up your analysis and gives you the flexibility to choose the best approach. This means your data can live its best life, and you can get the most out of your research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re starting a new research project, try thinking about what kind of taxonomy will best serve your goals—soon, you’ll have a whole toolkit ready to meet your next research challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want to learn more about tagging taxonomies?

It’s a great feeling and one that makes me smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my first successful user research projects was a larger-scale discovery of how people used our SaaS platform daily. We targeted the right people, colleagues sat in on the interviews, and each participant gave us rich stories full of juicy information. I collected all of this information and ran my &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/miroverse/user-research-debrief-and-synthesis/?social=copy-link&quot;&gt;debrief and synthesis sessions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After speaking to 25 people, the amount of data in front of us was vast and deep. At the end of synthesis, we had over 50 insights scattered throughout the different tags we used—pain points, goals, motivations—and no idea what to do next. Before this, my studies hadn’t been large enough to warrant prioritization. So instead, I would take the few insights that we created, and the teams would go about working on the ones that made sense. Sure, some insights went into the backlog, but the team immediately worked on most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, my teams looked to me to help them prioritize what was most important from the user’s perspective. Unfortunately, it can sometimes feel like everything is essential for a researcher, leaving me with no idea how to help. So I went to work researching how to go from the large amount of data we had to action items for the teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First, delineate between insights and other findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a large amount of qualitative data, you will likely have different levels of information. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming/&quot;&gt;creating an affinity diagram&lt;/a&gt; to highlight patterns in the data, I start by classifying the trends by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bugs.&lt;/b&gt; Often bugs come up under pain points and signal that something on your platform/service is not working as intended. I separate these from insights because the team should deal with them immediately (or as quickly as possible) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usability issue. &lt;/b&gt;Usability issues also come through under pain points. These problems are generally issues with the experience on a platform/service. A typical case could be participants struggling with navigation or checkout flow. Ideally, these are easy to solve for and are “low-hanging fruit”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preference/wish. &lt;/b&gt;When participants tell you what they think they want, they might be lying, but not on purpose. Humans are notoriously bad at predicting what we might want/need in the future. I put preferences and wishes separate to be further investigated later &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, what happens when something you found doesn’t fit into these categories? You might have an insight on your hands! The way I define insights are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discovery about human behavior and the underlying motivations behind that behavior&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information that challenges what we believe about users and how they exist in the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge that uncovers fundamental principles that drive us towards seeing users in a new way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the data you collected falls into one of these buckets, you can move it into the insights pile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on your insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have classified your findings and insights, it is time to shift focus to the insights. I typically delineate the types of information we’ve found on my own and then invite colleagues to review the insights I have pulled out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this session, we review the insights to get colleagues familiar with what we learned, especially those who didn’t have the time to sit in on sessions. I typically give people 15 minutes to review the insights and, during that time, they write down any questions they have. We then answer as many questions as possible about the insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the team reviews the insights, it’s time to figure out the next steps. I have had teammates walk in and laugh (nervous laughter) at the number of insights we have and question how we will know what to do to move forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Time for prioritization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After everyone understands the insights properly, it is time to figure out which ones to focus on first. This part can be complicated since you need to involve the group in the prioritization process. There are many ways to prioritize insights, but here are some that I use the most often:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dot voting. &lt;/b&gt;Dot voting is the most straightforward prioritization model, but it also comes with the caveat that those voting need to deeply understand customers and business needs. If your team checks this box, you can easily use this method. Depending on the number of insights, I give everyone a certain number of votes and ask them to vote on the most impactful insights. We then prioritize the insights with the votes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spending money. &lt;/b&gt;Similar to dot-voting, using money is another way to help prioritize what to work on next. Everyone gets one hundred dollars (or whichever currency) to spend on the insights. They can spend as much or as little on each insight. We prioritize the insights with the most money&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;(R)ICE model. &lt;/b&gt;I use the (R)ICE model with product managers familiar with the process and teams less comfortable with our users. The RICE model looks at reach (how many people will the insight impact?), impact (how much value will this insight generate?), confidence (how confident are we this insight will positively impact/is helpful for users?), and effort (how much time will this insight take?). You may not have the answers to all of these questions, but they are good to think through&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effort versus impact matrix. &lt;/b&gt;If the above RICE model feels too complicated, the effort versus impact matrix might be a perfect compromise (you can find a template on Miro). Like above, the team decides how valuable the insight would be to customers and then determines the amount of time/effort it would take to fulfill that insight. You then prioritize the data that falls into the high impact and low effort area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;After the prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you prioritize your insights, it is time to take action by creating ideas for addressing the insights. One of the best ways to act on insights is a brainstorming or ideation workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick your topic or insight you want to focus on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a “How Might We” statement. For example, if your insight is about how people want to try on clothes before they buy them online, you can change this to “How might we allow people to know they are purchasing the right size/fit before they have to pay for the clothing?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick an ideation technique. There are many ideation techniques, but my favorites are Flip the Problem, Crazy 8’s, Method 6-3-5, and Worst possible idea.

Partly because it’s a differentiator for us to recruit top talent—many of whom are driven away from employers who have become remote-first—and partly because my Co-founder Brad and I truly believe in the benefits of an in-person culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the advantages of remote working are certainly worth noting—reduced commute times, greater flexibility in how employees organize their days, and reduced reliance on living close to an office—the advantages of a designed, curated office environment for collaboration and creativity are hard to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offices enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2013/12/happy-workaholics-need-boundaries-not-balance&quot;&gt;physical boundaries&lt;/a&gt; between work and life. These physical distinctions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/melodywilding/2021/05/24/4-ways-to-compartmentalize-work-when-blurred-boundaries-are-stressing-you-out/?sh=43b160e22cf3&quot;&gt;help our brain compartmentalize&lt;/a&gt;, improving our ability to place work and home matters in separate emotional or mental boxes. While this problem is more acute for people who have problems switching off (or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2013/12/happy-workaholics-need-boundaries-not-balance&quot;&gt;Happy Workaholics&lt;/a&gt;” as my executive coach &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edbatista.com/&quot;&gt;Ed Batista&lt;/a&gt; would say), as remote work becomes a long-term reality, I’d be surprised if more people don’t start to feel the same. Too often, working from home starts to feel like living at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a customizable home office space is touted by advocates of remote working, creating something that is equal to or better than the ergonomics at work can be difficult given the constraints of small apartments—noisy family, flatmates, or neighbors, and limited individual resources. There’s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811029730&quot;&gt;considerable research&lt;/a&gt; into what makes a healthy workplace. Ergonomics goes beyond chairs and desks, through to lighting, minimized distraction, temperature, humidity, and connectivity, the entirety of which can be difficult to achieve in the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shared office space enables &lt;a href=&quot;https://legallysociable.com/2014/01/23/the-three-conditions-sociologists-say-are-crucial-for-friendship/&quot;&gt;proximity and spontaneous interactions that establish strong relationships&lt;/a&gt;, builds camaraderie (even &lt;a href=&quot;https://thriveglobal.com/stories/teams-who-break-bread-together-bond-team-series-8-10/&quot;&gt;eating together helps create better teams&lt;/a&gt;), and caters to social needs through events, activities, games, and more. I’m a strong believer in relationships and trust over process and tools. As cliche as the table tennis table is, it does serve a purpose in breaking up the workday and providing an opportunity for team members to interact in a casual social setting to build better personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to note that we’re an office-first company, not an office-only company. Does everyone have to be in the office all the time to be successful at Dovetail? By no means. We encourage flexibility and our team has the freedom to work the way that suits them best. Some people—especially individual contributors doing deep work who are in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)&quot;&gt;state of flow&lt;/a&gt;—benefit greatly from being able to work at home, in a park, or in a cafe. However, we maintain that working from home should be an option but not a requirement. At Dovetail, the center of our culture and work life will always be our office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main driver of a healthy in-person culture is investing in an office experience that brings value to our team. It shouldn’t be a place we’re forced to turn up to every day. It shouldn’t be a dreary set of cubicles. We believe our team should want to come to the office for what it can offer them. From dedicated spaces for brainstorming and collaborating, to healthy lunch options or beers on tap—our whole team has been involved in curating everything in our office to make it more than just a place for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Then the pandemic happened&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining an in-person culture has been difficult lately due to the recent coronavirus outbreaks in Australia’s major cities that have seen us go back under strict lockdown. Plus, Dovetail is currently in a huge growth period, hiring around one person on average a week (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/careers/&quot;&gt;check out our jobs board!&lt;/a&gt;), compounding this issue further. The good news is lockdowns are temporary, and we hope to get back to our office as more people are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reaching out to people in our team to see how they have been coping with lockdown, both personally, and through a wider team survey. The results weren’t great—people are struggling. More than I realized. Slow internet connectivity, less-than-ideal home office setups, a lack of social interaction, and complications from living with others came up a lot as challenges and reasons why people miss our office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a bit rundown too. For the first six weeks of lockdown, I felt great, but recently I’ve felt unhealthy. Usually, I’m a motivated person, but I’m less willing to log on in the morning. I get out of bed later and later. On weekends, I struggle to get off the sofa and leave the house. My neck is crunchy and sore and my IT band is playing up again. I’m constantly looking at screens: when I was in the office, screen time would be broken up by ad-hoc chats, face-to-face meetings, walks around the block, games of pool. Now it’s just laptop, phone, television, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With news of an even longer lockdown in Sydney, I discussed these feelings with my executive coach, Ed. We discussed how I could improve my situation and the situation for our team. As we launch new initiatives for keeping our team connected and healthy during this difficult time, we thought it would be a good idea to share what we’re doing. If other founders understand our passion for office culture, perhaps they might find inspiration and direction in these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are a few things we’ve introduced to help us get through the rest of lockdown, whether it’s another eight weeks or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;$500 each for work or health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re giving everyone in our team up to $500 for better home office ergonomics, improvements to their video call experience, or improvements to their health (exercise, fitness, sports equipment, clothing, etc.). Working from home setups are often less than optimal. We want to help improve this and encourage our people to get out and about as often as they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;$100 a month for upgraded internet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a fast-growing company, communication is important at the best of times. even more so when we can’t meet face-to-face. Poor internet is a big frustration that came out in our recent survey. There aren’t many problems in life you can throw money at to fix but making sure everyone is on the fastest internet available is one of them. For the rest of lockdown, Dovetail will contribute $100 / month to help our employees upgrade plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;KitKat afternoon every Friday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;KitKat days (company-wide days off where we all “take a break”) are a longstanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/careers/&quot;&gt;Dovetail employee benefit&lt;/a&gt;. We usually have five or six a year, but under lockdown, we’re implementing KitKat Fridays, where we wrap up at 3 pm to give us all an opportunity to disconnect and get the most from the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No meetings between 12 pm and 2 pm every day&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re working in the office, we typically fall into a healthy routine. Commuting and shared lunch breaks helps with this. However, when we’re at home, this routine often disappears. It’s actually even more important that we establish routines when we don’t have physical boundaries, otherwise work and life start to blur together into an unhealthy mix. I think everyone should feel like they have time to get out of the house each day for a walk or eat lunch away from a screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;25- and 50-minute meetings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know back-to-back meetings suck when you’re working from home. I’ve often had multiple meetings where I haven’t been able to get up and stretch my legs, grab a snack, or hit the loo. In Google Calendar, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/work-hacks-from-g-suite-how-to-host-more-effective-meetings&quot;&gt;setting called speedy meetings&lt;/a&gt; allows for a small break at the end of each session. We’ve all enabled this option to give us more breathing time between catch-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Culture built like a pyramid—from the ground up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created our values and culture from the ground up, so it’s no surprise initiatives to keep us connected during this period aren’t only coming from the top. Tactical things like playing online games (we’re big fans of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geoguessr.com/&quot;&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/a&gt;), regular wellness check-ins, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.donut.com/&quot;&gt;Donut Dates&lt;/a&gt;” that provide an intentional time for our team to connect, virtual yoga classes, and an incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kumospace.com/house-of-dovetail&quot;&gt;digital replica of our office&lt;/a&gt; created by our Vibe Manager on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kumospace.com/&quot;&gt;kumospace&lt;/a&gt; where you can play different games or just chat to break up the monotony of video calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for me? I’m also making a few small changes. I’m going to block out 4 pm for a run three days a week, try to play tennis once a week, look into setting up a second workstation downstairs, so I’m not on the kitchen counter 50 percent of the time, and hang up some artwork in our study. If you’re looking for ideas on how to get the most out of remote working, Ed has two great articles. If you live on your own, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edbatista.com/2020/03/working-from-home-alone.html&quot;&gt;Working from Home...Alone&lt;/a&gt;, and if you live with someone else, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edbatista.com/2020/03/working-from-home-together.html&quot;&gt;Working from Home...Together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we emphasize the importance of reaching out to each other one-to-one. Especially those who are living alone or with children. Donut Dates are a great way to make this intentional, but even a quick “Hey, how are you feeling?” Slack DM can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up a strong support system from the top down is vital to getting through the isolation of remote working. I hope other founders who’ve found themselves and their team in a similar spot can get through this tough period. I know we’re looking forward to getting back into the office and finally see the end of this pandemic. In the meantime, one of our major strengths is our culture of strong relationships, open communication, and supportiveness—and we need to continue to invest in this now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Researching the right thing versus researching the thing right]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/researching-right-thing-versus-researching-thing-right</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/researching-right-thing-versus-researching-thing-right</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design thinking world has &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/doing-the-right-things-and-doing-things-right-a-design-researchers-process-model-abd222699bbf&quot;&gt;popularized a distinction&lt;/a&gt; between “designing the right thing versus designing the thing right,” as visualized by the Double Diamond Design Model. When it comes to researching our customers or users, I believe we also need a similar distinction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a plethora of resources available on the topic of “researching things right” (think of all the guides focused on methods, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/design-research-tools/&quot;&gt;tooling&lt;/a&gt;, or approaches to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-skills/&quot;&gt;data gathering&lt;/a&gt;). However, it’s harder to find content on ensuring we’re “researching the right thing” for our organizations. That is, how do we decide the research topics that ultimately yield the most impact for users, organizations, and the ecosystems in which we operate? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we continue to mature the research practice, it’s on us as researchers to ensure we spend precious research resources on answering the questions that create the most value for users and organizations alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we sort through all the different possible business questions we want answered to find the most impactful ones? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One approach is this simple set of interactive exercises I facilitate at the start of every research project (both remotely and in-person) to ensure we’re always “researching the right thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise one: “Things we know”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sow the seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify your key stakeholders—the decision-makers, designers, engineers, marketers, or anyone else who will apply and act upon your research topic. If the topic area isn’t yet defined, then the stakeholders are anyone that has a research question. Invite your stakeholders to a (physical or virtual) meeting and ask them to come prepared with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about their target audience of interest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things they believe they already know about their target audience of interest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Set the scene&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare a physical or virtual space where stakeholders can stick post-its throughout the workshop. The bigger, the better. For remote and virtual meetings, a Figma, Mural, or Miro virtual whiteboard works great. For in-person meetings, a big whiteboard or erasable marker surface works best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The brain dump. &lt;/b&gt;Set a timer at the start of the meeting and ask the stakeholder attendees to spend the next 10 minutes in silence writing down all the things they believe they already know about the research target audience of interest on individual post-its. For example, when trying to understand the experiences of beauty product buyers, I asked them to write down all the things they already know about beauty buyers from their past experience with this audience. It’s fine if there isn’t much known—this is itself valuable input for research scoping. There should be one “fact” or idea per post-it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, draw a vertical line titled “Confidence Scale” in the middle of the physical or virtual board. Label the top of the line “100% confident” and the bottom “0% confident.” As this exercise is intended to spark discussion more than determine scientific accuracy, confidence can be subjective to each person&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing &amp;amp; mapping. &lt;/b&gt;After the 10 minutes of silent writing are up, ask each stakeholder to come up to the board and read out each “fact” they know about the target audience to the rest of the room. After each fact, they read out, ask the stakeholder how they learned this fact. Then ask them to plot it on the vertical line you drew, based on how confident they feel about this fact. Since you stakeholders are reading their “facts” out loud, interestingly, sometimes the stakeholder participants in the room will contradict each other’s “facts,” signaling a ripe area for research insights to settle the discussion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant should get a chance to read out the things they “know” and plot them onto the vertical line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you should have an idea of what your stakeholders already believe to be true about your users. Interestingly, it often happens that information about users that stakeholders are convinced is “true” turns out to not be true (or far more complex) during the research. These delta between perception and reality are some of the most interesting insights to highlight for stakeholders during the insight sharing phase. The tension between their conviction and the actual truth is a natural attention-grabber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I once had a group of product managers in a room convinced that their target users, restaurant owners, highly preferred to structure their reports in a specific way. Research interviews with these owners revealed a range of report preferences due to their varied organizational structures. This was an insight that I highlighted in the research insights presentation as I knew that it would be interesting. As a result, it was acted upon by these product stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise 2: “Things we need to know”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This second exercise can follow the first within the same meeting. As you’ve already asked participant stakeholders to come with their questions in mind, everyone should have what they need to map out all the questions and prioritize them as a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The brain dump. &lt;/b&gt;As with the previous exercise, set a timer and ask your participants to spend 10 minutes writing down all the different questions they have about the target audience. Remind everyone to limit each post-it to one question. It’s okay if the questions aren’t worded as research questions yet—you can rephrase them in your notes and share them with the group in the next step. (Sometimes, questions about technical and operational feasibility will sneak in, but beware that the primary focus should be questions about the people served by a product, service, or idea your team is working on. Reminding the stakeholders to focus on questions about experience and attitudes helps keep the session as relevant as possible)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, draw a chart with the X-axis titled “business impact” and the Y-axis titled “feasibility” in the middle of the board. It doesn’t matter where you draw it in relation to the previous exercise &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing &amp;amp; mapping. &lt;/b&gt;Once 10 minutes have expired, as with the previous exercise, ask each participant to come up to the board and read off each question on their post-its. After each question they read out, ask the stakeholder what they would do if they had the answers to this question. Questions like, “What would the answer(s) to this question allow you to accomplish?” Based on their reply, ask them whether this accomplishment is high impact for the business (the right side of the horizontal line), low impact, or somewhere in between. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For the same post-it question, now ask, “Is it currently feasible to implement or apply the answer to this insight to the product?” Based on their reply, ask them whether feasibility is high, low, or somewhere in the middle of the Y-axis. Ask them to plot the post-it on the appropriate point in the chart relative to the business impact and feasibility. 

For example, if the question on the post-it is: “Would beauty buyers use an app to purchase cosmetics?” and after you ask some straightforward questions on impact and feasibility, you might find while a new app would be beneficial to the company, there aren’t enough resources to deliver it. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat sharing and mapping steps until all stakeholder participants’ have plotted their post-its. I recommend taking notes as each participant is sharing their questions to keep track of the ultimate aim of each question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After each stakeholder has plotted their questions, the chart could look something like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As business impact and feasibility of application are relative among the plotted questions, stakeholders might want to adjust the positioning of some of the early plotted post-its. At this point, ask everyone to look at the distribution of post-its and speak up if anything doesn’t feel right. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the research questions we prioritize are the ones that scored high on both business impact and feasibility-—the top right corner of the chart. Next, it’s time to collectively decide where the delineation for the most impactful and feasible questions are. This division will vary depending on the number of questions, the amount of time you have to answer them, your resources, etc. But the goal is to draw a dividing box where everything in the top right box is what you will scope into the first iteration of research because it’s the most impactful low-hanging fruit. Everything outside of the box can be parked and revisited later.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a science to determine what is impactful enough to make it into the first round of research—it should be a decision based on your unique team needs, urgency, and resources for each project. An additional or alternative axis to the question prioritization chart could be research effort needed to answer the question—though this is often something I, as the researcher, assess for each question in the top right corner after the workshop. Based on the highest mix of business impact, implementability, and effort, I report back to the team with my recommended initial research scope and follow-ups for future research iterations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Clayton Christensen said, “Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go.” In addition to prioritizing the research scope, these exercises also help create a space in stakeholders’ minds “where answers can go” by deliberately getting them to ask the research questions. This focuses precious research resources on gathering insights that have a higher chance of being acted upon and positively impacting the business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you tried other research question prioritization exercises? Or did you give these two a spin? We’d love to hear how it went!

You’re in luck—check out these key quotes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Approach to tagging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, tagging is just affinity mapping and finding the best way to bring different thoughts together to see the united threads. I want to identify trends in the information to help our team better understand the core themes from the research. My approach is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s helpful to have groupings of the themes I want to look for as columns within Dovetail. It might be metrics or something about collaboration, for example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do the research, &lt;a href=&quot;/help/transcribe-video-and-audio/&quot;&gt;upload the video, get the transcript&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll start tagging things&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll use a long name at first. I might start by highlighting a sentence and creating a tag as long as: &lt;i&gt;Customers are contacting many other people in the course of them completing this task&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I go through other interviews and repeatedly see the same thing, I might summarize the point into a statement about collaboration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I might end up with a number of these different extended tag names about various aspects I’ve noticed. Then I’ll go back to my taxonomy and see what I can merge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, tags will be generated through different projects because I’m constantly adding new tags as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Project structure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each folder essentially represents a feature, and then all the &lt;a href=&quot;/help/an-overview-of-projects/&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; within that folder are independent pieces of conducted research. Let’s say there’s a piece of research where we did one-on-one interviews, another where we did user testing, and another where we did a card sorting exercise. We’ll separate all of these pieces of research so it’s clear why we conducted the research and what the outcomes were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use a title page or readme within a Dovetail project to summarize what the research was about. We might include the recruitment email that we sent or leave a comment about the customers we contacted. It helps the people looking back on the research, people shuffling teams or new people who join the team to have better context for why we conducted the research and what we got out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workspace tags&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We generally use&lt;a href=&quot;/help/tag-across-projects-with-workspace-tags/&quot;&gt; workspace tags&lt;/a&gt; across all our research because the themes around the research are often the same. You’re still trying to learn out about a particular feature, and the core aspects of that feature don’t change. Rather than recreating tags every time we run a new usability study linked to existing research, we use workspace tag boards. We’ll add or amend those tag boards as we need them. It’s a consistent flow of gaining and developing an understanding across multiple pieces of research, as opposed to an independent thing that you only do once and won’t come back to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get a lot of go-to-market and feature feedback from our frontline teams like support and account executives. We have a separate project where all that information goes, and we’ve enabled the same workspace tag in that project. It means that I can pull together the go-to-market feedback, the survey feedback, the usability testing feedback, and the one-on-one generative study that we did and get a complete picture across all the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can go back to a particular tag, see all the information we have, and avoid any blind spots. Having a consistent tag ensures that I’m collectively analyzing the information when making a decision or informing a design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tagging the same data with multiple tags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s naive to think that there’s a black and white around what somebody says. People are complex, and even within a sentence, they can touch on a variety of themes. I’m not concerned about using multiple tags on the same thing; I’ll highlight numerous themes equally. There are many ways to cut and slice your qualitative information, and you must have the flexibility in your system to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple tagging is crucial to help you understand all facets of the data. Without that ability, I’d have to sit there and say, I want to tag it about alerts, and I want to tag it about temperature, but now I have to pick one. If I ever go back to try and look at the other thing, I can’t find it because I didn’t tag it that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Using fields&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/help/add-structured-data-with-fields/&quot;&gt;Fields&lt;/a&gt; are exclusively around searchable content related to the customer interviewed, including name, email address, time zone, customer number, their account executive if relevant, stage of the customer lifecycle, or maybe the date and time of the interview as a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re getting information from our go-to-market teams that reference specific customers. We are also conducting one-on-one research or usability studies with those customers. We use fields to search Dovetail and find all the information related to a particular customer, in order to build a full picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Jules&amp;#39; advice about creating a tagging taxonomy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to start is to upload your research and start with digital affinity mapping. Just remember, you’re creating tags for things that you and your team find interesting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of research is that we don’t know what we’re going to find. We’re trying to establish what was learned from the research and then apply it &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need something structured before starting. If you come in too structured, you’re saying I know what we’re going to learn from this. It’s counterintuitive to think you can have a set of established tags because that indicates that you know what you’re going to find, and that’s seldom the case with research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overthink it, don’t stress about it, and don’t expect to have all the perfect tag names upfront. Always be open to what you’re learning in a research study and see what groupings naturally come about. That’ll give you the best idea of progressing your research, advancing the design, and securing the best outcome for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tagging taxonomies are one of the most discussed topics in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/#slack&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dovetail’s Slack community&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, you can continue the discussion there with over 2,400 other Dovetailers.

She’s a designer, facilitator, a regular speaker on the conference circuit, and an all-around guru when it comes to the user experience craft. Spencer has also worked in the industry for two decades now, where she’s had a front-row seat to the explosion of the UX discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From relative obscurity to a key business differentiator, the way the business world looks at user experience has transformed product thinking forever. As people who live and breathe it every day, we thought it would be instructive (and fun!) to take a trip down memory lane. To explore the shifts in thinking around the discipline over the years, plotting its course from the darkness of development-driven products into the light of the user-centric present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, let’s learn a thing or two about the evolution of UX from the perspective of a woman who’s spent her professional life at its coalface.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tell us about your early experiences in UX.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late nineties, when I started working in what is now called user experience, everybody was talking about usability. There wasn’t consistent terminology back then, and I was mostly acting as a consultant because there weren’t many in-house jobs.
It was the early days of the web. Software was difficult to use. So a lot of the field and academic contributions were around a Jacob Neilson-style of usability. Jared [Spool] has this great quote, “We don’t talk about edibility in food. We should be doing better than that.” But that’s where we were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who were the primary drivers of usability and UX back then?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There weren’t a lot of people focusing on it. Software design and development was mostly done from a development-focused approach, not a user-focused approach. Sometimes that can result in good products. Often, it doesn’t result in good products because you haven’t thought about the flow of people and the fact folks don’t know about the product the way you do. Developers or makers know it in detail, the nitty-gritty, the data, and the jargon. It’s hard to make great products if you can’t break that down for the people using it who may not have your existing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, the idea of usability started to gain more prominence. In the early 2000s, the web was growing along with the number of companies putting content on websites. This led to the emergence of information architecture, which tried to solve a lot of fundamental problems. Like, how do you do basic navigation? How do you group and categorize content so people can use it? How do we start introducing user-centered approaches into our work? There was a stronger focus on UX around that time that began to leak in with ideas like contextual design and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the motivation for pursuing more user-focused design during this time?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a mix. A lot of it was individuals realizing our products weren’t very good and people, maybe having read some books or done some academic reading, saying, “actually, there’s a better way to do this by focusing on the users.” But it wasn’t across the board.
In the early 2000s, we were all pushing and fighting to get research done. I look at it now, and it’s still not universal, but researchers are part of the process, where 15 to 20 years ago, it was difficult to do any research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took several years for the business side of the equation to realize that there was money to be made or saved by focusing more on users. And again, that’s not universal—but it’s certainly more obvious now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When did you first notice the emergence of specialist researchers in product teams?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw that start to happen after &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.uk/&quot;&gt;gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; got started. Gov UK was high profile, and its user-centered, research-focused approach contributed significantly to its success.
It was there where I saw design specializations starting to fall out, as well. Rather than just user experience designers, Gov UK and the Australian government also had roles like user researcher, content designer, and service designer, which nobody ever used much elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you think research will get a seat at the table, similar to design?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think product managers and product owners are firmly at the table. I’m not sure if designers are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you think designers are still searching for that seat at the table?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design can be used in two quite different ways. The word design in our field can mean strategic decision-making, but it also can mean making screens. Those designers making high-fidelity screens, working in product teams are not getting any seat at the decision-making table—they’re being told to make the thing. And I think they’re probably not super happy about what they were told design was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies understand that solving problems in new ways by understanding customers is a good thing. In that regard, the broad concept of design has a place. But those two things don’t necessarily bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you think research will have a more strategic role in the future?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often when people are struggling to get buy-in, they haven’t understood their role and context. They haven’t researched the organization to understand how to communicate their value. So when researchers are saying, “We need to do research. It’s super-important you should just believe me,” I know they haven’t looked at what matters to the company.
Is this company going through a transformation? Is it trying to save money? What drives it? How do people make decisions? If you understand that, then you can understand what research is and understand what it does. And then you can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/the-power-of-storytelling-with-ben-crothers/&quot;&gt;the bridge between the company goals and their customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What predictions for the future do you have about the UX discipline?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t like predicting the future, so I’m going to extrapolate from the present. That’s all my head can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have seen roles become more granular, and I’m seeing UX become less focused on the “U” and more about the making of screens. If you are working in a product team as a UX/UI person and making high-fidelity screens, there is no user in that. So it’s not UI/UX. It’s interface design because there’s little to no incorporation of the user in that process.
Over the past few years, more and more designers have come out of programs like boot camps, and more and more companies are hiring designers. We didn’t have very many people with a focus on design on teams in the past. Now there seem to be zillions. I’m not entirely sure what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to how we did it in the past, designers could be more generalist, and entire teams would weigh in to solve customer problems. I don’t know what will happen in the future, but I think it’ll keep fragmenting. I don’t know that hiring a lot of designers and sticking them on small agile teams to do feature-based screens will make any of our products much better, though.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Four pitfalls of establishing a tagging taxonomy as a team of one]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/four-pitfalls-tagging-taxonomy-team-one</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/four-pitfalls-tagging-taxonomy-team-one</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Qualitative user researchers generate and analyze massive volumes of data as part of their daily work. Information spawned from popular exploratory methods like interviews and observations takes the form of many mediums, including video, audio, and photographs. Each hour of research conducted can easily require three or more hours for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? The attention to detail required to ensure one does not miss insights spans a swath of time-consuming activities. It begins with pre-analysis tasks such as transcribing audio or video recordings, continues with carefully reading the content of these transcripts, then concludes with the monumental task of highlighting key findings and synthesizing them into actionable recommendations. When done right, the payoff is tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These duties are at the heart of researchers’ responsibilities, and many of us adore performing them. At the same time, mounting workloads, excessive screen time, and a desire for continual improvement have driven many to seek means of optimizing these activities. Fortunately, there are solutions to support research practitioners in automating repetitive tasks so they can spend more time understanding and advocating for their customers (Dovetail, the parent company of this blog, is one of them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly are tagging taxonomies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closely tied to a research activity commonly referred to as coding, tagging taxonomies are structures that formalize how researchers categorize and interpret data. Specific tags to implement vary at every company. However, they generally encompass common themes that emerge in your customer research sessions and data. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Experience with your product&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delightful moment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain point&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usability issue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bug/glitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Core behavior and needs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspiration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The domain in general&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor company or product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feature request or recommendation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When properly implemented and refined, a tagging taxonomy drastically speeds up the research analysis process, leads to the uncovering of impactful themes, and can ultimately result in better evidence-based customer-centric decisions that improve your product’s user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all sounds fantastic, right? Such a massive reward does not come without effort. Creating, implementing, and refining an effective taxonomy is no small undertaking. Without a seasoned research leader in your team or a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/the-characteristics-of-top-researchops-practitioners/&quot;&gt;ResearchOperations practitioner&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a tagging taxonomy can become a daunting task riddled with deterrents: how do we make time? Where do we start? How do we know we’re doing it correctly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are great questions. As previously alluded to, one size does not fit all when it comes to building tagging taxonomies. The rules, parameters, and protocols differ depending on the nature of your research, size of your team, and deadline cadence. When it comes to best practices, practitioners from around the world are still experimenting, refining, and learning as they go based on field experience. In this article, I’ll share lessons learned from my experience establishing a tagging taxonomy as a team of one at a startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building a taxonomy as a solo researcher at a startup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2016 and 2018, I led UX Research at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/reflexion-health-inc/&quot;&gt;Reflexion Health&lt;/a&gt;, a telerehab company focused on helping individuals recovering from hip and knee replacement surgery conduct physical therapy digitally from the comfort of their own homes. Working in an emerging field, I focused sizable efforts on exploratory research to better understand our demographic of senior-aged users, learn more about the physical therapy space in general, and evaluate the merits of our digital-physical therapy solution. Overseeing the development of multiple product lines and a totally novel user experience versus traditional physical therapy brought the need to balance the speed and quality of my work. This involved executing processes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/streamline-your-user-research-process-in-seven-simple-steps/&quot;&gt;streamline productivity&lt;/a&gt;—one of which involved establishing a tagging taxonomy. Let’s delve into several common pitfalls researchers encounter when setting up a taxonomy and how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pitfall one: not creating a tagging taxonomy earlier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solo researchers often find themselves balancing responsibilities for both User Research and ResearchOps. With perpetual impending deadlines and barrages of requests from stakeholders, advocating for, establishing, and maintaining a tagging taxonomy can feel like a lower priority endeavor versus daily tasks like recruiting users and creating research plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite the initial time and resource investment required, creating a tagging taxonomy actually saves countless hours in the long run by helping you accelerate your analysis and achieve your research goals with high-quality, evidence-based answers. Over time, a tagging taxonomy can even help you uncover new insights from previous research by identifying common themes between past projects and newly conducted research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pitfall two: creating new tags from scratch for every project&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential stumbling block when creating a tagging taxonomy is creating a new group of tags for every project. While there will be certain project-specific and unique situational tags for each user research project, it can be a mistake not to establish global tags that relate to common occurrences researchers encounter in nearly every session—things like pain points and motivations. It can be very valuable to establish a set of global (also called universal) tags, then compliment them with project-specific tags after analyzing the data from the sessions. For an outstanding in-depth discussion of global versus project-specific tags, check out our article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/global-project-tags-taxonomy-research-repository/&quot;&gt;Creating global and project tags for your research repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pitfall three: defining too many or too few tags&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we tend to love digging into the specifics of data—slicing and dicing it in countless ways to identify interesting patterns about our customers. While intellectual curiosity can often reveal helpful learnings from your research, going overboard can lead to the creation of too many hyper-specific one-off tags that don’t have enough merit to inform an important decision that impacts your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely—as champions of design thinking—we might have the urge to define very general tags, so we don’t overwhelm our stakeholders with an excessive number of tags. This oversimplification can result in missing the richness, nuance, and epiphanies hidden in our research data. As detailed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-we-learned-creating-tagging-taxonomy/&quot;&gt;What we learned from creating a tagging taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;, limiting your taxonomy to 25 tags across five groups strikes a great balance between efficiency and depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pitfall four: forgetting about iteration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your tagging taxonomy will evolve with the needs of your customers and organization. As professionals who conduct research nearly all day long, it can be highly tempting to desire a “set it and forget it” approach to maintaining a tagging taxonomy. However, the principles of user research remain: we must build for our users, evaluate our experiences, and iterate. It can be invaluable to frequently think about who will consume your research tags and configure your taxonomy for their needs. Also, remember that, as with implementing any new process, there will be a learning curve. Ask your teammates for candid feedback, regularly inquire about its effectiveness, and consider creating help documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Now it’s your turn to avoid these pitfalls as you build a taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a tagging taxonomy can be intimidating. As an incredibly useful but relatively new tool, it’s natural to feel uncertainty while implementing one in your organization. Sometimes the best approach is to start small—begin by identifying global tags for categories you frequently encounter in your research and match it to evidence from research sessions using a repository like &lt;a href=&quot;http://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;. From there, you can begin to refine the protocol for using these tags, evaluate the effectiveness of the taxonomy, and continually evolve your processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered some common pitfalls you might encounter along your tagging taxonomy journey and how to mitigate them. We’d love to hear about your questions, experiences, and lessons learned from implementing tagging taxonomies throughout your career.

The round was led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.felicis.com/&quot;&gt;Felicis Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, with participation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blackbird.vc/&quot;&gt;Blackbird Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://grok.ventures/&quot;&gt;Grok Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, and Didier Elzinga, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cultureamp.com/&quot;&gt;Culture Amp&lt;/a&gt;. The company has created a &lt;a href=&quot;/features/user-research-repository/&quot;&gt;collaborative, easily searchable repository&lt;/a&gt; for all of an organization’s customer research to fully inform and expedite product decisions; users can share data-backed insights across the broader business in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding comes as Dovetail has generated remarkable customer growth over the past year. The company has added &lt;a href=&quot;/customers/&quot;&gt;over 1,000 customers&lt;/a&gt; in just 12 months, including Datadog, GitLab, Harvard University, IBM, Nielsen Norman Group, and Wiley, to an impressive global customer base that includes Boston Consulting Group, Canva, Cisco, Deloitte, Maersk, Shopify, Square, VMware and more. Enterprise growth, in particular, has topped 20 percent month-over-month as subscriptions continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Closing the customer understanding gap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As organizations grow, a customer understanding gap develops between those who are exposed to customers regularly (i.e. user researchers, product managers, designers, sales team members, and support) and those who aren’t. Dovetail was created to close this gap by democratizing data so that everyone in an organization has relevant knowledge at their fingertips. This type of access to information facilitates faster, better decisions and empathy with customers that generate better products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our customers repeatedly tell us that there’s been no source of truth for research data and customer insights across their organizations. This is really frustrating for them because it creates massive inefficiencies and unnecessary disconnects,” said Dovetail CEO and co-founder Benjamin Humphrey. “To solve the problem, we’re building a home for customer knowledge that is a single, searchable repository for discovery, curation, and sharing of data and insights in a secure and privacy-conscious way. This will enable all organizations to build a customer-centric culture that will fundamentally improve the products and services brought to market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/powering-your-organizations-home-for-research-at-scale/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more about the customer understanding gap →&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create and share research reports with evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Dovetail’s commitment to ongoing product innovation, the company also unveiled its latest feature, Stories. Dovetail users now have an entirely new way to save, curate, and remix research findings and various data sources within the Dovetail platform. In a simple, self-service search, users can pull insights, video highlights, tags, interviews, or entire projects from anywhere in Dovetail, incorporating them into a story. Once added, it’s easy to organize content with a drag and drop editor so that users can tell a compelling story around their findings and insights. Users can also add colored sticky notes, headings, and text to make stories visually appealing, as well as customizable reference cards, embedded files and images, an integration with Unsplash, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories also makes it possible to identify important themes across projects that might otherwise go unnoticed. Cross-project reports can be generated within minutes to dive into relevant learnings about a specific persona, feature set, or product usability. This prevents prior research from living in silos or becoming shelf-ware that decays over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Driving remarkable customer growth with a self-service model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deep customer insights are at the heart of every top performing company. Before Dovetail, these insights were buried across teams and difficult to access in a centralized way to drive innovation,” said Victoria Treyger, general partner and managing director at Felicis Ventures. “From day one, the Dovetail team focused on building the world’s most robust research platform that delivered unparalleled customer insights to teams and grew organically via a scalable, self-service model. As a result, Dovetail’s product-led growth motion is driving a level of explosive customer adoption across mid-market and enterprise customers that is matched only by companies like Canva, Dropbox, and Atlassian. We are thrilled to partner with the Dovetail team to bring the power of customer insights to companies around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories is just one of Dovetail’s recent updates. Others include greater customization options, particularly for admins who control the user experience. On top of its successful Zoom integration, Dovetail has now added an integration with &lt;a href=&quot;/features/integrations/&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Dovetail has incorporated three new features to its &lt;a href=&quot;/features/research-participant-database/&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt; add-on to enable tracking of research participants in a privacy-conscious way. On top of this, &lt;a href=&quot;/security/&quot;&gt;new security features&lt;/a&gt; and organization processes like single sign-on, remote session log out, and SOC 2 audit are part of the platform. With the latest round of funding, the Dovetail team will be able to take its capabilities even further to meet the evolving demands of modern organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Powering your organization’s home for research, at scale]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/powering-your-organizations-home-for-research-at-scale</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/powering-your-organizations-home-for-research-at-scale</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, our mission is to enable the world to create better products and services through deep customer understanding. We believe that as organizations grow, a “customer understanding gap” develops between those exposed to customers regularly (like user researchers, product managers, designers, sales folks, frontline support, and more) and those who are not. We want to close this gap so that &lt;b&gt;everybody in an organization&lt;/b&gt; has customer knowledge available at their fingertips. We believe this will enable faster, better decisions and drive empathy with customers, ultimately resulting in better products and services for the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe a vital part of this vision is changing how customer research findings are shared throughout an organization. In the past, access to research findings has been fragmented across roles, departments, and tools. It’s common for people to embark on arduous journeys to build the customer understanding that allows them to do their job effectively, whether that person is a product manager, a designer, an executive, or a marketing manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A repository for customer research helps solve this by centralizing data and insights into one collaborative, searchable, and secure data warehouse. It has to be flexible enough to work for various data types, methodologies, and organizational structures, while also integrating with other tools to weave the customer throughout the product development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fulfill this vision, we’re introducing a host of new features on our &lt;a href=&quot;/pricing/&quot;&gt;Analysis + Repository and Enterprise plans&lt;/a&gt; that I’m excited to introduce to you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More customization features than ever before&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of your colleagues visiting Dovetail to consume research in a self-service way, we think it’s important that your workspace is personalized to your organization. Our new &lt;b&gt;customizable home&lt;/b&gt; feature lets admins control the new user landing experience for consumers—change the content and layout of the home to set context, provide usage instructions or link resources, introduce the research team, or drive visibility to important projects or particularly insightful findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home also uses our new block editor, which means you can insert references to key projects, create an activity feed with our new live search blocks feature; leave written instructions; and tailor the look and feel with layouts, images, text cards, tables, files, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admins can also &lt;b&gt;set a custom theme&lt;/b&gt; for their workspace that applies your brand’s primary color throughout Dovetail, including in all buttons, tabs, and menus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pull in relevant files with our new Google Drive integration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year we released a Zoom integration to make it easy to import your Zoom recordings to Dovetail for transcription and analysis. Now, you can connect &lt;b&gt;Google Drive&lt;/b&gt; to import Google Meet calls and other files. Alongside our Zapier integration for real-time ingestion of all kinds of data, it’s now easier than ever to build a centralized research repository with Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also made some improvements to how files work in Dovetail workspaces—&lt;b&gt;files now show up in global search&lt;/b&gt;, where you can preview certain files and filter results by type. Lastly, you can now bulk drag and drop multiple files into editors across Dovetail—whether that’s a note, insight, story, or home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/account/google-drive/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connect Google Drive to Dovetail →&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Track research participants in a privacy-conscious way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we released &lt;a href=&quot;/features/research-participant-database/&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to keep all your participant data in one place. You can create profiles for each research participant, then link a person to a note or insight. People enables a connection between the research you’re doing and the people involved, which makes demographic segmentation easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve released three new features to make People even better:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two new field types, &lt;b&gt;single &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;multi-select&lt;/b&gt;, let you quickly capture structured data on a person to easily segment data during analysis and in search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now generate randomized &lt;b&gt;custom profile pictures &lt;/b&gt;for your participants. This is just one of the many innovative features we’re building to make privacy in research fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you can now add comments to a person. This is useful for keeping a record of when someone has last contacted a participant to avoid over-contacting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/features/research-participant-database/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn more about People →&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enterprise-ready with single sign-on, SOC 2, and more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take the privacy and security of your data seriously. Over the past few months, we’ve continued to invest in essential security features and organization processes like single sign-on (now with IdP-initiated login for Okta), remote session log out, and SOC 2 audit. We’ve also overhauled our &lt;a href=&quot;/help/categories/security/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/help/categories/legal-and-privacy#privacy-and-gdpr&quot;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt; documentation in our &lt;a href=&quot;/help/&quot;&gt;help center&lt;/a&gt; and released a new master subscription agreement and privacy policy to simplify and clarify our language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we’ve grown our team to include full-time support and customer success to provide the highest level of service to our enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/enterprise/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn more about our Enterprise plan →&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Talking tagging taxonomies with Caitlin McCurrie]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/tagging-taxonomies-caitlin-mccurrie</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/tagging-taxonomies-caitlin-mccurrie</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’ve managed to pry Caitlin, a Lead Researcher at Atlassian, away from her current research projects to chat about her approach and considerations to tagging and taxonomies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video below, we’ll be chatting to Caitlin about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How she tags her data and at what level of granularity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her approach to creating and maintaining a taxonomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How she takes taxonomy inspiration from her time in academia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time she created a top-down taxonomy in Dovetail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How she includes her stakeholders in the taxonomy process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What taxonomies to use for evaluative and generative research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her approach to using fields in Dovetail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for something to read? You’re in luck; check out some key quotes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you define a tag?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tagging, we’re trying to represent the things we want to measure—abstract concepts we can’t necessarily go and directly ask about. The thing we’re asking indirectly and trying to measure indirectly is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/encyc-of-research-design/n213.xml#:~:text=A%20latent%20variable%20is%20a,in%20research%20are%20latent%20variables.&amp;text=Because%20measurement%20error%20is%20by,captured%20in%20the%20latent%20variable.&quot;&gt;latent variable&lt;/a&gt;. A tag is a way for me to represent how the data links to the latent variable that I’m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you tag your data?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take the approach that all data is useful data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How I tag something depends on the kind of data that I have in front of me, and what I’m interested in studying. If we’re tagging an interview, my tag would be the phrase, concept, or paragraph that captures the latent variable I’m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s your advice for people that are stressed about tagging?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags and taxonomies are just vehicles to help you understand the data. It doesn’t have to be perfect; you use it to understand the data better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that means you’re more comfortable using a top-down approach every time, even though it doesn’t look like the right thing on paper, do that. Don’t worry about getting caught up in using the exact correct language around your tag and what it’s called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A summary of how Caitlin approaches creating a bottom-up taxonomy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start with a fast pass through the data. &lt;/b&gt;I’ll go very quickly and tag any constructs that I’m interested in as they come up. I’m very free-form and generous about tagging here, almost trying to time myself with how fast I can go through my data. I don’t want to get caught up in the details because I’m trying to be big picture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start recording observations. &lt;/b&gt;As I’m going through, I start to see patterns and see interesting things. I might get some post-it notes and start to record things that I’m observing as I’m capturing those tags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stop at halfway. &lt;/b&gt;At about halfway, I have some sense of what’s going on with this topic that was pretty new to me before I started this research. Now that I see some interesting things arise, I like to stop at about the halfway mark, return to the tags, and start refining them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when I’m starting to create that taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refine the tags.&lt;/b&gt; I consider whether I could have expressed that tag a little more succinctly, whether I’ve captured that latent variable that I was interested in there appropriately, whether I remove any quotes from that tag. I’m also starting to think about redundancy. I’ve been super free with my tagging up into this point, and I might have repeated myself, so I’ll start to combine my tags or delete some tags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Describe the tag. &lt;/b&gt;I’ll add a short description to my text. When you click into &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/highlight-and-tag-project-content/&quot;&gt;the tag feature in Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, there’s an option to put some text below your tag. I’ll include some information on what that tag represents and how it relates to my construct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continue. &lt;/b&gt;Now that I’ve got a slightly clearer picture of what constructs I see in my data, how they start to fit together, how I might talk about them, and what I should expect to see in the data when I am tagging, I go back and continue with the other half of my interviews. I’ll start to apply a more systematic process to the tagging of my data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Return to the first half. &lt;/b&gt;Depending on how much time I have in my project, I might even come back to the first half of my data and refine those tags as they apply to the first half. I’ll be more systematic, polish out the taxonomy that I’ve created, ensuring that the taxonomy now reflects my understanding of the subject&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continue recording observations. &lt;/b&gt;I’ll continue to take those post-it notes and memos about the patterns I see in the data. The taxonomy now is going to help me to understand the patterns and the relationships between those constructs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review to insights. &lt;/b&gt;I’ll review my taxonomy and consider the relationship between different constructs. This might tell me something specific about what I’m interested in, the things that I’m studying in my research project. That’s when we start to move into the insights phase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From bottom-up to top-down. &lt;/b&gt;Now I’ve got a taxonomy that can then be used in a follow-up study, where we might have a bit more of a top-down approach to creating a taxonomy, a phase of research where I have existing data and existing insights. Maybe I’ve done something in an earlier project that’s directly related to this. I have a sense of the topic and what might be going on here. Say this is a secondary follow-up study to the one I was just describing, I already have that taxonomy. So I might adjust some tags and apply it to the second round of data collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tagging taxonomies are one of the most discussed topics in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dovetail’s Slack community&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, you can continue the discussion there with over 2,300 other Dovetailers.

When I started as a user researcher, I thought I would be running around scheduling, interviewing, and presenting. I was right, but I didn&amp;#39;t also know I would be creating a culture of user research at every organization I joined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years, I’ve realized that it isn&amp;#39;t just about doing the research. We have to be more thoughtful about creating a research-friendly environment, balancing types of research, and including colleagues throughout our research process. In my experience, when I’ve joined organizations, I’ve often been the first or only user researcher. This meant creating a research framework and culture that made colleagues excited about how I could help and what value I could bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start with a framework&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people don&amp;#39;t understand what you do, they won&amp;#39;t know when, how, or why to come to you. When introducing user research to an organization, the best thing I have done is creating a user research framework. In this document, I detail everything anyone could want to know about user research at our organization. Not only does this save you time from responding to the same questions repeatedly, but it is also an excellent onboarding document for new researchers or people who will be interfacing often with research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are the components I typically include in a framework deck&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is user research?&lt;/b&gt; This details the basics of user research, what it means, and why we conduct user research, and the different user research methods you use at your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misconceptions of user research.&lt;/b&gt; This section highlights the common misconceptions of user research (e.g.: too slow, too expensive) and how to combat those misconceptions or issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value of user research across different departments. &lt;/b&gt;This section highlights how user research can positively impact different departments  (e.g.: how I can help product managers or marketing achieve their goals), and how user researchers can help these departments get answers to their customer questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UX research principles &amp;amp; mission.&lt;/b&gt; Under this section, you would detail the mission you want to achieve with user research, and the principles you (or your team) will follow as user researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UX research responsibilities. &lt;/b&gt;This section details the exact responsibilities of a user researcher (e.g.: recruitment, debriefs, synthesis) and can also detail where others can support (e.g.: note taking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UX research process. &lt;/b&gt;This section details the user research process at your organization and, ideally, is a step-by-step process of how and when people should reach out to you, and what they can expect from a user research project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UX research metrics (optional).&lt;/b&gt; This section can detail a few different metrics, such as usability testing metrics, or something like OKRs that your team creates to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-metrics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;track the impact of user research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resources. &lt;/b&gt;Under this section you can include any additional information that might be helpful to colleagues, such as links to an intake document, a research repository, or a research roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FAQs.&lt;/b&gt; This section can include common questions that you find colleagues asking you and can be a great place to send people who are asking questions about the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact for you (or the team!).&lt;/b&gt; Lastly, you can list all of the contact information for the team and, if you have multiple researchers, which researcher looks after what team or area of the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I share this information regularly with the teams I work with the most, and any time someone has a question, I direct them to this document. It becomes the go-to place for people to learn and understand how I can help them achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Set up a request process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to get research requests in all different forms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long-winded email&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A one-sentence Slack message&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone dropping by my desk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything in between&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, this meant I was constantly asking follow-up questions or sitting in follow-up meetings to get more information about the request. This running around took up a lot of my time and wasn&amp;#39;t efficient. I needed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/streamline-your-user-research-process-in-seven-simple-steps/&quot;&gt;streamlined way to receive research requests&lt;/a&gt; and an easy way for people to request research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I created an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/10IwzR_zC7sNZj4Js_s49Vgu0k5XE5-M4EsAJqr62cyw/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;intake form&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I set up on Google Forms. Then, whenever anyone reached out about a research study, I sent them this intake form to fill out. Not only did this mean I received all the necessary information upfront, freeing up my time, but it also meant I only received serious requests. Once I made the document, I presented the new process to the different teams with an accompanying timeline. I circulated this form constantly around the organization, making it simple for anyone to reach out with a request. I put the link at the bottom of every summary, in every presentation, and within the framework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once colleagues understood the timelines and the request process, I had many more requests coming earlier, and stakeholders were much more proactive about upcoming research needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create a research roadmap and backlog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After creating the intake form, I had an influx of research requests and nowhere to visualize them for myself or others. I took inspiration from the product teams and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1klndwCXnecj48tbKj5Sd8VgpZpKaiJzKSgC8WoRnwzw/edit&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;created a research roadmap, and backlog&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—this document listed upcoming, planned research, and research requests that we had not yet prioritized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research roadmap and backlog were crucial for a few different reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It showed the team what research was underway, what was coming up, and when I had the capacity for upcoming studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was very well aware of when they needed to come to me to request research, changing the team’s mindsets to be more proactive than reactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization started to learn the value of user research and how I could help them through various studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could show how I was impacting the organization through the work I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was doing too much evaluative research, it became clear and gave me the evidence to show my manager we needed to do more generative research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to performance reviews, it was easy to look back on my work, provide names of people/teams I worked with, and understand what I had accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When setting up the roadmap, I sat with my teams to ensure we aligned our roadmaps. I sat through their quarterly planning and updated my roadmap bi-weekly when I met with stakeholders to ensure everything was up-to-date. Although it was some effort, the value I got from the roadmap was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Teach and democratize, to a point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you feel comfortable at an organization, it is time to start looking for people who can help you, especially if you are a team of one! However, when it comes to teaching and democratizing user research, it is essential to tread mindfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I start with finding colleagues who have research experience or are interested in learning basic user research skills. These skills include note taking, recruitment, and non-complex usability testing. In the early stages, I bring these colleagues through a training program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small group classes that cover note taking, recruitment, and basic usability testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowing me for at least two studies in which we cover these skills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting two practice sessions internally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing their first user-facing session with me shadowing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiving and acting on any feedback &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this training, they are free to do basic research. If those who went through training haven&amp;#39;t researched in three months, they have to do a quick refresher of the above program, including a review class, one shadow of a study, and one dry run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By teaching others the basics, you can free up your time to focus on more strategic and complex research, such as generative research or deliverable generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Invite people—better yet, create a sense of FOMO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you do all the above, it doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that people will come running with research requests or a desire to do research. When this happened to me, I realized I had to create a sense of FOMO for the wary teams. So here are the steps I went through to get the skeptics interested and participating in research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find your champions. &lt;/b&gt;At every organization, some people are interested in (or at least lukewarm toward) user research. Grab these colleagues and get started helping them with studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Invite relevant teams to everything. &lt;/b&gt;Always extend the invite to product managers, designers, and developers to come to the research sessions. Even if they say no, at least you are putting yourself out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Include debriefs in the research session time. &lt;/b&gt;Whenever I send colleagues an invitation to join a research interview, I always have the extra thirty-minute debrief in the calendar invite. For example, if the session is only one hour, I send a calendar block for an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share how you are helping them achieve their goals.&lt;/b&gt; I get testimonials from other teams about how research has positively impacted them. After gathering a few of these, I share them with the organization to tangibly show the value user research can bring to the different teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Educate people on user research. &lt;/b&gt;There are so many misconceptions about user research, and sometimes colleagues have had bad experiences in the past. Get to know why they are not excited about working with a user researcher and point out ways to quell their fears or anxieties. For example, many people think user research has to take a long time, so prove them wrong with a lean study!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When all else fails, set up a goal for exposure hours.&lt;/b&gt; I was at an organization where, despite my best efforts, very few people were interested. I discussed with my manager that I would like to set up a goal for exposure hours. Ideally, each person on the product/tech teams would be exposed to customers two hours a week. When I presented this goal, I explained the benefits that come with exposure to customers. Once people started sitting in sessions, those exposure hours increased naturally on their own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building this type of culture took time and effort. But, ultimately, developing a user-research culture doesn&amp;#39;t only help the organization but also helps you. People will see the value you bring and, over time, it becomes easier to track your positive impact. Take the next six months and dive into creating and fostering this mindset; the work is well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

I used a WordPress template and begged my developers to help me with custom coding. It was painstaking work. I filled out an extensive form for each research project, and eventually, I had one and a half year&amp;#39;s worth of research in our repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was so excited. Aside from the developers helping me with code, I worked on this independently, wanting a big reveal in the end. It took some nights and weekends to catch up, but it was worth the work because I solved my teams&amp;#39; pain point of not finding research. Huzzah, I had leveled up and cured the forever headache of the black hole of insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering all my teams into a physical and virtual room, I was buzzing with excitement. A few minutes in, I unveiled my work. I turned into a salesperson conducting a demo with all the enthusiasm in the world. My colleagues were happy, and I left them to explore this new wonderful world I created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, people didn&amp;#39;t. I got constant slack messages or emails asking where this or that project would be and how to find a particular insight they had thought they heard. That&amp;#39;s when I learned two essential lessons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do big reveals—get feedback early and often on your work, especially if it involves other people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t employ my user research hat as I would for any other project—stakeholders are my users, and I failed them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I went back and undid most of my work. I included stakeholders in tests, sat down with them to discuss tags, and collaborated on creating a repository &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for them.&lt;/i&gt; Although the work was slower, we created a fantastic taxonomy that enabled teams to find research more effectively and efficiently—the cornerstones of usability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why create a research repository in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, I was hesitant to jump on the repository train. I was unsure about the value of repositories. If people weren&amp;#39;t taking the time to search through Google Docs for research, why would they search in a repository? However, at the time, I worked in a start-up of about thirty people. I quickly funneled results to the one designer and product manager I worked with and the entire company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I moved to a medium-sized company, things changed. Colleagues had done some research before I arrived, but it was difficult for me to find. As I added to the mess and people pinged me with questions, I realized the frustrations colleagues felt trying to find something in the depths of Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The value of research repositories came rushing forward&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer questions from colleagues and less link-copying-and-pasting from the same documents over and over and over&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less time spent digging through Google Drive to find that &lt;i&gt;one sentence&lt;/i&gt; from that one user one month ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More infrequent meetings about the research we should do, but we have already done before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A place of knowledge for the organization that hosts everything, despite anyone leaving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information becomes more accessible to colleagues, meaning they are less reliant on researchers to find and use insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start a research repository&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all the signs pointing toward &amp;quot;collaboration&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;do your research,&amp;quot; I still managed to create my first repository in a vacuum. As painful as the flop might have been, I learned the crucial steps to creating a research repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Start with tags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good tags are an important component of a successful research repository. These tags enable you and your colleagues to effectively and efficiently search through the masses of data to find what you need. Without proper tags, you will end up with a similar mess that I made above, where no one can find anything, and you resume the never-ending copy-and-pasting links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways I start to differentiate and build a tagging system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Global tags&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global tags are used across an entire organization to describe something that happened in a research project. We use global tags outside of the scope of a single project, feature, or product. They allow us to see patterns across the entire product(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These types of tags might sound familiar to researchers since we commonly use them during synthesis sessions. The most common global tags I use are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usability issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habit/task&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feature requests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project-based tags&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project-based tags are much more specific than global tags, and we base them on a single project. These tags come from analyzing the data after a particular project and seeing what themes develop. They allow you and your colleagues to dive deeper into specific data and insights, much more so than global tags allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we are running a research study about how people find new travel destinations. As we synthesize the data, we find the following themes that will turn into tags:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language barriers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram inspiration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-tagging will be your best friend, so it is okay to tag an insight with several different tags, including global and project-based tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the above example, we find the following insights and use multiple tags to make them accessible:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to look at Instagram to get inspiration for their next trips because of the pictures and trusting the people who post #instagram inspiration, #habit, #motivation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews are difficult to find and believe since people aren&amp;#39;t sure if a negative review without text has anything to do with them, and they are also unsure of paid positive reviews #reviews #pain points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are concerned about the language barriers they will encounter in specific destinations and are unsure how easy/difficult it will be to navigate, so they won&amp;#39;t go unless they have a way to easily translate what is going on #language barrier, #pain point #need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Test (constantly) with your stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four ways I use to test taxonomies with stakeholders in the different stages of the repository creation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1x1 interviews.&lt;/b&gt; Before I go off and create a whole taxonomy, I have 1x1 interviews with colleagues, asking them about how they would search and categorize particular insights. In this session, I give them many insights and understand what words they would use to search for them. We then discuss global tags, and they give me preliminary feedback on these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Card sorting.&lt;/b&gt; Once we have feedback for the global tags, I conduct card sorting sessions to understand the hierarchy of the tags. These sessions give me an idea of what global tags might commonly go together. I also use this opportunity to throw in some project-based tags to see how people respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usability testing. &lt;/b&gt;After we establish our preliminary tags, I will conduct several rounds of usability testing to ensure the search, filtering, and overall experience makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Constant feedback. &lt;/b&gt;Once there is research in the repository, I give colleagues a feedback form to constantly log any bugs, usability issues, or confusing tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create a taxonomy dictionary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After brainstorming and conducting several rounds of tests, it is time to create a taxonomy dictionary. I bring together stakeholders during this session, and we make (an ever iterative) taxonomy dictionary. This dictionary has all of the global tags we use with a definition and examples. If we need to make changes to the global dictionary, they have to be discussed and agreed upon by the entire group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dictionary also gets updated with project tags, so it is constantly growing and evolving. At the end of every project, the team will agree on the specific project tags, which we will then add to the dictionary. Although it seems like a lot of work to continuously update the dictionary, it is a fundamental document. It allows people to peek in and serves as a vast knowledge reference for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patience and constant iteration are vital for taking on a research repository with a proper taxonomy. The most thriving research repositories enable colleagues to get what they need whenever they need it. By taking the time to create a collaborative taxonomy dictionary, you are saving work for yourself and making research more accessible across your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

We repeatedly hear the same problems regarding how user research data and insights are created and shared:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User research is siloed within departments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same research is repeated over and over&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research reports go unread by stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulatively scaling datasets don&amp;#39;t lead to cumulatively scaling knowledge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout this blog post, we’ll dive into these problems and discuss how a research repository can help and the principles that make for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/solution/ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;great research repository solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User research is siloed within departments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the user research team, almost all teams within an organization conduct some form of customer research, even if they don’t explicitly call it that. Product managers interview users, designers test prototypes, salespeople talk to leads, support tracks topics, marketing facilitates focus groups, HR run feedback surveys, and customer success run &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/net-promoter-score-nps/&quot;&gt;Net Promoter Score&lt;/a&gt; surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These functions and teams all do user research differently, analyzing their data with different tools, and publish mountains of data, reports, and updates across a variety of formats and products. Stakeholders and consumers struggle to find what’s relevant to them—the signal in the noise; the needle in the haystack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The same research is repeated over and over&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, when a new researcher joins a product team, they go off, do some research, and come back with the same insights and findings that are already known. It takes months (years, even!) of experience to build the necessary context and to get to tangibly meaningful insights that have the power to effect change and be force multipliers in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tenured employees already know this and grow skeptical of a research team that tells them things they already know. Over time, thanks to the same research being repeated, and the same conclusions echoed, the effectiveness and credibility of the research discipline within your organization is slowly eroded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherifmansour/&quot;&gt;Sherif Mansour&lt;/a&gt; is a distinguished product manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; with over 10 years of experience working on products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira&quot;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence&quot;&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt;. He reflects that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges we’ve seen is how to help new team members &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/interview-atlassian-sherif-mansour/&quot;&gt;build a shared understanding&lt;/a&gt; of the key insights that existing team members have already realized. The cost of re-learning is expensive, especially in growing organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because research is stored in a variety of formats, tools, and silos throughout the organization, there’s no way for anyone to quickly get up to speed on what is already known. Searching through years of unorganized archives of reports, documents, and presentations to build context is an impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, when that researcher leaves the company, they take a lot of undocumented knowledge of your customers with them—hopefully not to a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reports go unread by stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written reports and presentations are the ‘go-to’ format for sharing user research insights, but unfortunately, there’s no standard for how they’re produced or what content they should contain, and every researcher structures them differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of reports are usually inaccessible to everyone in the organization: they’re shared spontaneously over email and chat or lost in Google Drive or Dropbox. There isn’t a clear place for people to go to learn about your customers. You’re lucky if these reports are read, and you’re even luckier if any action is actually taken as a consequence of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2005, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Nielsen_(usability_consultant)&quot;&gt;Jakob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/&quot;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the pain of finding usability testing reports in his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/archiving-usability-reports/&quot;&gt;Archiving Usability Reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people have to search for usability reports, they’ll often fail—or they won’t even know what to look for because there’s no single place that lists all available usability results. Even worse, if past project owners are the only source of results, you risk losing valuable institutional memory when these individuals leave the company or get reassigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another detriment of traditional research reports is that they’re usually disconnected from the raw data and evidence that led to the formulation of the report in the first place. It’s difficult for stakeholders to understand how a researcher came to a particular insight, because there’s often no way to dive into the details of a specific usability test, interview, or survey response. This lack of traceability leaves stakeholders spending time poking holes in the research or methodology, instead of taking action on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard research reports also often lack any features that allow you to track engagement. PDFs don’t have read-receipts, and there are no easy ways to measure the impact research is having in your organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, of the researchers we spoke to, none of them actually enjoy creating these reports. They find themselves spending more time designing and formatting internal reports for stakeholders, rather than actually talking to customers and users. The best workaround we’ve seen is reusable templates for research reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cumulatively scaling datasets don&amp;#39;t lead to cumulatively scaling knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research data and customer feedback comes in many shapes and sizes, including surveys, quotes, interview notes, video recordings, industry trend reports, social media posts, app reviews, and more. Researchers rely on all this information to synthesize research findings, usually in the form of a research report. Typically, this research lives in a file storage system like Google Drive or Dropbox or a wiki like Confluence or Notion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizing and curating this ever-growing collection of data is relatively simple for a small organization. However as companies grow, the systems used to store customer research don’t scale and end up requiring significant administration to maintain. Someone has to ensure all the files are searchable, appropriately restricted, and tidy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, the repository becomes unwieldy and difficult to use. This creates the opposite of the intended effect—people stop using stored research and the total sum of an organization’s customer research leads to &lt;i&gt;less &lt;/i&gt;customer knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why a research repository?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most organizations with a user research function acutely feel the pain of the problems above. If you don’t yet, it’s likely you will in the future as you scale design and research. Much of the pain can be eased through a thoughtful approach for how research data and insights are captured, analyzed, standardized, archived, and shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a ‘Wikipedia’ for your organization’s customer knowledge: a centralized, searchable database of research and insights that the entire company leverages to make better decisions. A single source of truth that &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/a-stakeholders-perspective-on-engaging-in-research/&quot;&gt;empowers stakeholders&lt;/a&gt; to engage with research and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/creating-a-research-culture/&quot;&gt;fosters a culture of research&lt;/a&gt; across your organization. Designers, product managers, and developers effortlessly pull up insights that answer common questions and, in one click, can explore the evidence—and understand the context—that led to those insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;research repository&lt;/b&gt; is just that—one central place, or source of truth, where people in your organization can go to find the latest insights from your research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The characteristics of a successful research repository&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked to user researchers, designers, and product managers across a variety of organizations, and we’ve settled on five key characteristics that lead to the successful adoption of a research repository. We believe all successful repositories are &lt;b&gt;retrievable&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;approachable&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;traceable&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;accessible&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;secure&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Retrievable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching and finding research insights should be effortless. Members of the product team should be able to easily find answers to their questions, self-serve, without needing to write complex queries or spreadsheet formulas. Insights should be easily filtered and segmented by attributes important to your organization, like segment, country, market, demographic, or even &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/net-promoter-score-nps/&quot;&gt;NPS&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers need to be able to conduct secondary research by easily retrieving prior research and insights and feed that into current research projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Approachable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research repository should be approachable not only for user researchers, but also for other members of the product team like designers, product managers, developers, and stakeholders like founders or executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating insights needs to be simple and delightful—your team needs to be bought in and want to use your repository, and they won’t if the experience is complicated, clunky, or slow. Stakeholders want to consume research insights in a lightweight, quick, and beautiful way, without needing to read multi-page reports or presentations. Anyone should be able to easily “remix” previous research and leverage an organization’s cumulative customer knowledge to make informed product decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Traceable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful research repositories aren’t just a collection of disconnected insights or recommendations. They also need to provide a path back to the raw research data which led to the insights in the first place. Research findings should be connected to the source material that the researcher interpreted to inform a particular insight. References to raw research data or ‘evidence’ enable stakeholders to see where an insight came from and understand the original context of the research method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone should be able to look back on a user research insight from years ago, review the evidence, and determine if it’s still relevant or has been interpreted correctly based on what is now known. Researchers should be able to look back to see if new insights could be developed from research data that was collected previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Accessible&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A repository needs to empower your organization to leverage customer research data and insights, and for this to happen your entire team needs access. New people who join your organization should be given access on day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t have to worry about managing access permissions for folders in Drive or Dropbox – the ideal research repository should be ‘open by default’. Team members should deep-link to your living repository over email and chat as the source of truth, rather than send around presentations or reports as static attachments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Secure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a research repository will act as the single source of truth for your organization’s customer knowledge, it’s likely it will include personal information and potentially sensitive data from a range of industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your research repository to be approved by your security, legal, and information technology teams, you’ll need to consider where customer data will be stored, what the processes are for retention and deletion, if data is encrypted or anonymized, and what security practices and policies are in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your organization has customers in the European Union, you’ll need to ensure that your research repository is compliant with the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/gdpr-design-researchers/&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Starting a research repository&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re convinced and want to start building a research repository in your organization. How do you get started? Aside from working out the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/what-is-researchops/&quot;&gt;governance and operations&lt;/a&gt; that will support how people use and interact with your repository internally, the most critical decision is selecting a tool or platform for your research repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flexible and generic tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most organizations start their research repository journey by assembling existing tools that are already used internally, typically because they’re accessible and inexpensive to set up. Teams cobble together faux research repositories with wikis like &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/software/confluence&quot;&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://products.office.com/sharepoint/&quot;&gt;Sharepoint&lt;/a&gt;, spreadsheets and databases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://products.office.com/excel&quot;&gt;Excel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;, issue-tracking tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/software/jira&quot;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, and storage tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example of using a flexible tool as a research repository solution, the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; have used their own product as a repository for their UX research insights. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-jones-13b73898/&quot;&gt;Sarah Jones&lt;/a&gt;, UX Research Manager at GitLab &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/10/building-a-ux-research-insights-repository/&quot;&gt;describes their repository&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of reports and slide decks, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/uxr_insights/issues&quot;&gt;issues to document key findings&lt;/a&gt; from research studies. Each insight is supported with evidence, typically in the form of a video clip or statistical data. We use GitLab’s related issues functionality to connect insights which were revealed during the same research study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As everyone at GitLab has access and knows how to use the product, this approach has been successful for them. However, most research organizations don’t have the luxury of working on a product that can be manipulated in this way, and flexible solutions almost always inevitably fail in the long term for a variety of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching and retrieving insights from these tools is cumbersome – search functionality is complex, limited, and unintuitive. In the case of file storage tools like Dropbox and Google Drive, searching within files is usually not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights are static and disconnected from the original research data. Recordings, transcripts, notes, and participant information has to be stored across many different tools and the evidence that supports an isolated insight is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not fit for purpose. Flexible, horizontal tools aren’t designed for research and use unopinionated terminology like cells, sheets, rows, and records instead of concepts that are research-friendly like insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often see people come to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; as a purpose-built research repository solution after trying to build a repository using tools that aren’t built for that specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a custom repository in-house&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfied with flexible, generic tools that aren’t fit for purpose, organizations with well-resourced research teams often look to design and build their own research repository in-house. Large enterprises like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-microsofts-human-insights-library-creates-a-living-body-of-knowledge-fff54e53f5ec&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f&quot;&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/nasdaq-design/organize-all-your-design-research-in-one-place-with-nasdaq-designs-mosaiq-ceccbb77bc38&quot;&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; have all shared details of their own purpose-built research repository solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s research team have built their own repository called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-microsofts-human-insights-library-creates-a-living-body-of-knowledge-fff54e53f5ec&quot;&gt;Human Insights System (HITS)&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-duignan-89493932/&quot;&gt;Matt Duignan&lt;/a&gt;, Principal User Research Manager at Microsoft explains, to help scale HITS across the entire Microsoft organization without losing the integrity of their data, they designed for letting people find insights while retraining context:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a user were to take an insight out of context, say to make an argument in favor of a new product feature, HITS makes it possible for everyone involved to look at the supporting evidence and come to a fuller understanding of what the context implies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of HITS enables research to be brought into conversations and make product decisions informed by customer data and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, WeWork built their own research repository solution internally, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/contributors/tomer-sharon/&quot;&gt;Tomer Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, then the Head of User Experience at WeWork, announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/polaris-research-repository-dovetail/&quot;&gt;the Polaris research repository&lt;/a&gt; in his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f&quot;&gt;Democratising UX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the article, an ‘open-source’ version of Polaris was &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/universe/expShuhNMi0Oc0xpb/polaris-ux-nuggets&quot;&gt;released as a template on Airtable&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the researchers we’ve spoken to who have tried to create a research repository with this template have not had success, for the same reasons why tools like Confluence, Airtable, and Dropbox don’t make good research repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With enough resources, building your own research repository can work since it can be tailored to specific needs and processes. However, given the complexity in building a bespoke research repository solution and the ongoing maintenance commitment, even large organizations rarely opt to invest in an internal solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why we built Dovetail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built Dovetail to be the platform for your organization’s user research, considering principles of &lt;b&gt;retrievability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;approachability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;traceability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;accessibility, &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;security&lt;/b&gt; from the ground up. With our platform, researchers, analysts, designers, and product managers can store user research data in one place, analyze qualitative data to discover patterns and insights, and share research findings with the rest of their organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/about/&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; has decades of combined experience working in product teams at &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://canva.com/&quot;&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://intercom.com/&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve all seen first-hand the challenges that come with managing customer knowledge and insights, and we’re passionate about helping teams understand their customers, make better decisions, and do great work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Search, segment, and retrieve data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve built an appreciation of how important it is to enable stakeholders to self-serve customer data and research insights. Researchers are usually stretched thin relative to their counterparts in engineering, product management, and design, and insights need to be scaled across the entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve built powerful, intuitive filter and segmentation controls that enable people to easily &lt;b&gt;retrieve&lt;/b&gt; research data and customer insights. Research data can also be enriched with contextual information: demographic data like name, age, location; contact details like email address and phone number; properties like persona, company, or license; and even someone’s &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/net-promoter-score-nps/&quot;&gt;Net Promoter Score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Approachable and enjoyable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A focus for us is making sure Dovetail is &lt;b&gt;approachable&lt;/b&gt; and enjoyable to use. We know a lot of research software isn’t particularly intuitive, especially academic qualitative data analysis suites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://maxqda.com/&quot;&gt;MAXQDA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qsrinternational.com/nvivo/&quot;&gt;NVivo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dedoose.com/&quot;&gt;Dedoose&lt;/a&gt;. While very powerful, these QDA tools are complex and beyond the reach of most commercial researchers and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We try to make it easy for people to analyze unstructured data, create insights and embed references to raw data, and making insight reports look good by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Embed evidence to your raw data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-microsofts-human-insights-library-creates-a-living-body-of-knowledge-fff54e53f5ec&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s Human Insights Library&lt;/a&gt;, Matt Duignan talks about “real-time curation” as a way to encourage participation in the research library / repository, to avoid the problem of reports being deferred to the end of the process:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone needs to synthesize insights in a way that optimizes for durability and reuse across time. But for researchers under pressure, it can be tempting to defer this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than running out of time to turn insights into durable, standardized reports, an insights repository should instead organically evolve over time, with &lt;b&gt;traceability&lt;/b&gt; back to the original source material and context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Dovetail has features to help with analyzing common research methods like interviews, usability testing, and surveys, it allows you to maintain traceability through embedded references to notes, quotes, tags, photos, videos, recordings, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Access for your entire organization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t want &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;our pricing&lt;/a&gt; to inhibit the effectiveness of research teams within organizations. To make Dovetail &lt;b&gt;accessible&lt;/b&gt; to everyone, we’ve been intentional about offering unlimited, free viewer accounts for people in the organization to view research data, read insights, and comment. This means that our customers only pay for researchers that actively contribute data, analysis, and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pricing model has accelerated the consumption of research in our customer’s organizations. Gemma Sherwood, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intrepidgroup.travel/&quot;&gt;Intrepid Group&lt;/a&gt;’s UX Manager has &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/customers/intrepid/&quot;&gt;shared with us&lt;/a&gt; that their UX team has now turned their attention to other departments like Marketing and Insights to get them involved in their research repository:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our broader goal is for the Insights and Marketing departments to utilize Dovetail as a searchable research library to improve their decisions and ground them in customer experience.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also invested in features that &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/manage-your-workspace/domain-restricted-sign-up/&quot;&gt;allow anyone with an email address&lt;/a&gt; at your organization to join your Dovetail workspace without needing to be invited and the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/faq/share/&quot;&gt;share your projects and insights&lt;/a&gt; with others who don’t yet have an account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Secure, and private by design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make &lt;b&gt;security&lt;/b&gt; and data privacy foundational principles of everything we do, and we recognize the importance of adhering to regulations to advance information security and data privacy, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/legal/policies/gdpr/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve chosen proven third party cloud providers, take regular data backups and test recovery, run penetration testing, encrypt all data at rest and in transit, conduct static code analysis and third-party vulnerability scanning, sanitize our logs, secure individual customers at the database level, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/security/&quot;&gt;many other cloud security techniques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of research repositories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think more and more organizations that talk to customers and leverage customer data to improve their products and services are increasingly frustrated with the pains of storing, retrieving, and sharing insights from user research. We believe that a thoughtfully considered user research repository is critical to mitigating this pain and unlocking the potential of customer research in organizations worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dovetail, we think we’ve built a solid foundation on our principles of &lt;b&gt;retrievability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;approachability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;traceability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;accessibility&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;security&lt;/b&gt;. Our team is motivated to make Dovetail the obvious platform for your user research and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re at the beginning of this journey. We’ve got more to learn from our customers, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/roadmap/&quot;&gt;many exciting features planned&lt;/a&gt; for the future.

Generally speaking, we think of surveys as quantitative data and numbers, but with careful planning, surveys can also add to our qualitative insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I used an open-ended question on a survey, I thought, “no one will fill this out.” I mean, how many times have you closed out of a box asking you to “please add any additional comments/feedback here.” Even as a user researcher who feels compelled to respond to every survey or feedback request, there were times I skipped this box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was right. Very few people responded to my open-ended questions. For a while, I determined that they simply don’t work. However, there are ways to frame and use open-ended questions in a way that gets more responses. Once I started using these tactics, I was overwhelmed with feedback and then had to tackle analyzing &lt;i&gt;all the data&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to write open-ended survey questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing open-ended survey questions can feel effortless. Just put a &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; in front of the questions and send it off. I thought this was the key to getting qualitative data from my surveys. However, the process is more thoughtful than this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of considering a survey as a list of questions, think about it as a conversation with participants. This process will lead to a more dynamic and open-ended survey, which will gather more rich data. Here are the steps I employ when writing open-ended survey questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think of the goal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before writing questions for a survey, it is crucial to understand the desired outcome. There is a time and a place for a user research survey, and we want to ensure we are using them correctly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys are wonderful for gauging large-scale behavior, preferences, and prioritization. They very rarely will give you enough deep data to elicit motivations or goals. If your survey aims to understand what and how something is happening, you are picking the correct method. We can use open-ended questions to get right at the root of that goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, let’s say we work at a stationery company and we are looking to understand:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of stationery people pick most often&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How people choose their stationery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which competitors people are using to purchase stationery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While several methods could work here, such as 1x1 interviews with a follow-up survey, we could also send a survey with a mix of closed and open-ended questions to get a more representative sample&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid common traps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few traps we can fall into when writing survey questions. I’ve looked over a survey I’ve sent and wanted to facepalm reading some of the confusing questions I’ve asked participants. By creating questions that are too complex or difficult, we can lower response rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common traps we can fall into are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leading questions &lt;/b&gt;can cause people to answer in a way that is not consistent with how they feel. Instead of using subjective language, be as neutral as possible when wording your questions. The most common leading question I see is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading: “How satisfied are you with our stationery?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not leading: “How do you feel about our stationery?” Very unsatisfied -&amp;gt; Very satisfied&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double-barrelled questions&lt;/b&gt; ask two questions at the same time and usually include the word “and.” When this is a closed question, it makes it impossible for the user to answer. Even when using an open-ended question, people generally only answer one part of the question. Instead of using an “and” or posing two questions in one, make them separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double-barrelled&lt;/b&gt;: “Which stationery companies do you use and what do you think about them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not double-barrelled&lt;/b&gt;: “What other stationery companies do you use?” “How do you feel about your most recent purchase at another stationery company?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future-based behavior questions are the most common mishap I see when it comes to surveys or interviews. People can’t predict the future, and most questions that ask about future behavior aren’t reliable. I could tell you that I will cook six times a week next week, but, guess what, I ended up ordering in two times and going out once, leaving me to cook three times that week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we can ask about participants’ past behavior to understand what their habits are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Future-based question&lt;/b&gt;: “How often will you order birthday cards every year?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Past-based question&lt;/b&gt;: “Last year, how many times did you order birthday cards?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mix it up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because we are trying to get rich qualitative data from our survey doesn’t mean every question needs to be open-ended. Response rates are better when you have a mix of closed and open-ended questions. I typically use the 60/40 rule, where 60 percent of my questions are closed and 40 percent are open-ended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, with the goals of this survey, I would consider questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What types of stationery did you purchase in the past six months? [Multiple choice]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father’s Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mother’s Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other (left open)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What other stationery stores have you purchased from in the past six months? [Multiple choice]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitor 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other (left open)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about your last purchase; how did you decide what stationery to buy? [Open-ended]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has been the most frustrating experience when purchasing stationery? [Open-ended]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do a few dry runs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used only to do dry runs for my one to one interviews with participants but quickly learned that it is imperative to send your survey to a few colleagues to sense-check it. If possible, consider sending it to some relevant friends and family too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to analyze open-ended survey questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve written your open-ended survey and sent it to the world. Now, get ready for feedback. I think about analyzing open-ended survey data in the same way as qualitative interviews. I go through this five-step process when analyzing this type of data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skim through the data to get a general sense of the responses you have gathered. While doing this, jot down some themes you notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Develop tags. I use a mixture of global tags (pain point, motivation, goal, need, task) and project-based tags. I come up with some preliminary project-based tags in step one, which are unique to that particular study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code the data with the tags that you created in the previous step. I do this by tagging each qualitative response with one or multiple tags. By using global and project tags, you can represent richer detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tally up the most common project-based tags that you found and pick the top three. These three tags will be the significant insights you focus on first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once you know the most common tags, pick out a few supporting quotes directly from the survey as supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the stationery example from above:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We receive qualitative feedback from the two open-ended questions we asked on the survey. I skim through the feedback and start to jot down the themes that I see from the input:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For question three: People look at their calendar to see upcoming events and bulk purchase stationery; people wait for sales to purchase; tend to buy many items from the same shop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For question four: Out of stock items; unclear shipping information; shipping delays; quality of the product is not good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I develop tags based on this feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global tags: pain point, motivation, goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project-based tags: bulk-purchase, sale, planning, return customer, lacking quality, shipping issues, out of stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I have created the tags, I go back to the raw data and begin the tagging process. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tend to wait for a sale to purchase a bunch of stationery at once because it is cheaper. I look at my calendar and think, what do I have coming up in the next six months, and buy all the birthday or celebration cards I think I will need, plus a few extras, just in case #goal #motivation #planning #bulk-purchase #sale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a few birthdays coming up, so I purchased a bunch of birthday cards. I didn’t realize where the cards were coming from and how long the shipping would take. It turns out, it took about four weeks to ship but was then delayed, so half the cards were useless, and I had to go out to another store to purchase the cards in time #pain point #shipping issues #goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this tagging process, I find the top three common project-based tags and focus first on those. I will then write insights based on these tags. In this case, the most common tags are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shipping issues.&lt;/b&gt; Specifically, not understanding how long it will take to ship &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sale purchases&lt;/b&gt;. Where people wait until they know when a store will have a sale and purchase a bunch of stationery at once&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planning&lt;/b&gt;. Indicating that people plan about six months ahead and purchase for all of the events they think they will need stationary for in the next six months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the insights further, I gather two or three quotes per insight to showcase what participants are saying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These quotes bring the insights to life and remind colleagues that our users are real people struggling with real problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it can be a considerable effort to analyze open-ended survey questions, it is worth it. You get a large amount of rich, qualitative data, which is especially helpful if you have sample-size skeptical colleagues. These types of surveys can help your teams make more informed decisions based on a mix of quantitative and qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Up close and personal with new Dove-atars]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-profile-avatars</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-profile-avatars</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we run a quarterly hackathon called Make It. It runs over two days and allows us to innovate on projects we’re passionate about and collaborate with new teammates. You can read about the first one we ever ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/newsroom/first-hackathon/&quot;&gt;in this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Make It, one of the teams decided to focus on improving avatars. No, not the highest-grossing film of all time, but the profile pictures you see scattered throughout Dovetail. We were stunned to learn that less than 13 percent of our users had uploaded a profile picture, and even a smaller number have assigned profile pictures to their research participants tracked in the People tab. Meaning that right now, your workspace might be looking a little dull and grey 😬&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to worry, here at Dovetail, we love finding opportunities to impress and delight our customers. A cross-functional team of engineering, design, and marketing set out to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protect the privacy of your participants by allocating randomly generated profile pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your workspace looks more colorful and enticing for you and your teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empower you to add personality to your profile and elevate the people analyzing and collaborating in your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable you to easily differentiate between participants when you’re scrolling through your transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enter Dove-atar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we went and executed anything, we huddled to cover off our use cases. We identified two use cases and considered what people should be able to change as part of their Dove-atar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Users. &lt;/b&gt;Dove-atar for the individual using Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;People. &lt;/b&gt;Dove-atar for the participants that you are tracking and managing in People.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the individual who is active in Dovetail. Your picture appears on your profile, when you are viewing, next to projects you are working on, and when commenting on something. A personalized profile picture enables your work to be more identifiable. For this experience, you should be able to pick some personalized elements like hair and clothes in an array of customizable colors. Jump into profile settings to build yours today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;People&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/research-participant-database/&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;, a way to track and manage your research participants. Due to privacy requirements, many users don’t upload profile photos of their participants. Our new profile picture builder is a creative, fun solution to this problem. But we figured that you probably wouldn’t want to build custom profile pictures for all of your research participants, so we built the functionality to randomly generate profile pictures in bulk. This was an exciting challenge because we needed to make profile pictures that didn’t assume anything about the person they portrayed and would work well for all people. Every time you add or import a person, a randdom profile picture will be automatically generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no guarantee we got it 100 percent right on the first pass, but thankfully it’s something we can build on easily, so please hit us up with any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers, The Dove-atar team&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three unexpected ways a research repository makes your life easier]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-repository-user-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-repository-user-research</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s an incredible time to be involved with customer research. As we previously covered in parts &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/predictions-user-research-2021-part-one/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/predictions-for-user-research-2021-part-two/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Predictions for user research in 2021&lt;/i&gt;, the demand for research continues to increase, and the democratization of customer research feels inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we love stakeholders’ invigorated interest in our work. At the same time, our field is facing growing pains. Just think about all the tedious and repetitive tasks that have followed you throughout your career—from small occurrences like a colleague asking for a link to your research findings for the fifth time through to repeating the same research findings presentation to different groups of stakeholders. Or what about the monumental task of onboarding a new researcher to your team and getting them acquainted with all the past research the team has previously conducted? Or knowledge transfer, and the inevitable loss of institutional knowledge that happens every time a colleague departs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-is-researchops/&quot;&gt;ResearchOps&lt;/a&gt; aims to address the ever-growing needs of research teams and has thrived in recent years as organizations continue encountering new challenges. ResearchOps aims to operationalize processes so researchers can focus on what’s most important: practicing their craft. Tools have become central to accomplishing this mission. Specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repositories&lt;/a&gt; have created a considerable positive impact in organizing, automating, and supercharging customer research workflows. They’ve eliminated many drab, repetitive tasks, so researchers have more time and energy to conduct research. Let’s delve deeper into the details through three common use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;#1:&lt;/b&gt; Onboarding new colleagues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased demand for customer research has resulted in more budget and larger headcount for teams around the world. This is truly wonderful and worth celebrating. At the same time, the classic 1975 software engineering essay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/mythical-man-month/&quot;&gt;“The Mythical Man-Month”&lt;/a&gt; holds true decades later in the user experience discipline: adding more team members to a project can actually increase the time required for that project’s completion. Why? Projects are complex. They often require a high level of subject matter expertise and relevant experiences in the field. Ramping up new members takes considerable time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, new members joining a research team often reference the old adage of “drinking from a firehose” to express the overwhelming feeling of needing to learn a high volume of information in a condensed period of time. This typically takes the form of hunting through a maze of shared folders for past research artifacts, taking notes on what they feel is important to remember, and frequently bugging teammates when questions arise. After several months on the job, this feeling alleviates...only to arise again as new team members are hired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter research repositories: a single, central place where all research and customer information lives. All notes, recordings, files, and photos in one place that’s both searchable and easily accessible. New team members can effortlessly tap into a single source of truth for the company’s entire customer knowledge base and painlessly get up to speed. Especially thoughtful research teams can even curate a “start here” project within a repository that contains &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the essential information a new colleague should internalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;#2:&lt;/b&gt; Sharing research with stakeholders and heightening the impact of research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many organizations, the practice of user research is siloed. Whether intentional or not, the research team serves as gatekeepers—acting as the only individuals with the keys to invaluable customer insights. Though many espouse the importance of evangelizing user research, often the only outlet for sharing work is periodically scheduled meetings or ad hoc requests from interested stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research repositories make findings more accessible, retrievable, and approachable. Rather than waiting for a calendar invite for a share-out meeting or bugging a user researcher via email, repositories unleash the ability for colleagues and management to self-service insights. Offering an easy way for stakeholders to consume research can contribute to a culture where stakeholders are empowered to seek it out, increasing the chance they will see the right insights at the right time. Colleagues can revisit and explore research at their own pace and style. The breaking down of silos and increased transparency also contributes greater trust among research teams and their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than static slide decks and reports, repositories also enable the storage of compelling multimedia research artifacts such as pictures, videos, and audio. These are almost always more memorable and engaging than pure text and help make your research insights stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those concerned about external stakeholders unintentionally drawing biased insights, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail’s research repository&lt;/a&gt; allows researchers to configure permissions for projects and limit which users have visibility of research data, so you never have to worry about colleagues seeing data that isn’t ready to be shared. It also has a feature to send email notifications about your team’s latest findings to make keeping stakeholders in the loop even easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;#3:&lt;/b&gt; Leveling up your organization’s overall research practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, research repositories offer countless ways to enhance your current research practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardize and speed up your research process with the templates for commonly used research methods like interviews and usability tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share project information across teams and departments through organization-wide tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save time (and sanity) using data filtering to help with segmenting, refining, and structuring data during the research analysis phase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlight specific evidence from research sessions to use as supporting evidence, then share your insights with teammates using Presentation Mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Import and transcribe recordings in a matter of clicks, then search the transcripts of these videos for the exact moment you’d like to cite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrate to create custom workflows with thousands of apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build cumulative knowledge about your customers over time which could result in new feature ideas or new product offerings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research repositories are becoming essential for organizations that are serious about customer research. They enhance the efficiency and quality of research, empower stakeholders to engage with research insights, tighten the feedback loop between product/service and customer, and help to heighten the impact of research across the organization.

Recruiting the right participants for your user research groups is hard. Whether it’s wading through screeners of unsuitable participants, dealing with monosyllabic non-responses, dodging the inevitable professional research participant, picking the right incentives, or simply getting people to turn up at all; finding the right users for your study is rife with problems that can derail otherwise fruitful customer research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we love research at Dovetail, we’ve invested quite a bit of time trying to work out how to make this process simple. In the past, we’ve written about how to find the right number of research participants, the dangers (and benefits) of leveraging your existing fanbase, different ways to find suitable candidates, good screening measures, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-participants-what-does-good-look-like/&quot;&gt;general guidelines to help you find the right person for the job&lt;/a&gt;. In the Dovetail product, we recently introduced “&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/track-manage-research-participants/&quot;&gt;People,&lt;/a&gt;” a new feature designed to help researchers track and manage research participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could say we think about it a lot. But, to be fair, probably not as much as our friends over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userinterviews.com/&quot;&gt;User Interviews&lt;/a&gt;, who have made it their core mission to help teams discover user insight with fast, easy access to high-quality participants for any kind of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we moseyed on over to User Interviews (remotely moseyed, via video call) to speak with their VP of Product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhforster/&quot;&gt;John-Henry Forster&lt;/a&gt;, to get his hot-tips and takes on some of the thornier aspects of participant recruitment. Namely, &lt;b&gt;the importance of diversity, how to vet your participants, and how much to spend on participant recruitment&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of diversity in participant recruitment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether a product team is looking to expand on a particular problem area or conduct exploratory research on a new product or idea, finding the right person to interview is crucial to the outcome. But what does good look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Forster, an ideal research panel is “a diverse cross-section of users who have the problem that you’re doing discovery on or solving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while countless pots of digital ink have been spilled dissecting the various considerations of finding the right participant, it’s Forster’s initial point we focus on. Diversity is important. And as we’ve written before, it’s also good for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t want to be talking to the five people with identical backgrounds that have your problem. You want to be talking to people that make up different vectors of backgrounds, so you’re not getting just a single perspective on what you’re doing,” explains Forster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some of the smaller user research studies, it’s hard to get rich diversity across every vector when you’re only gonna talk to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/&quot;&gt;five or six people&lt;/a&gt;,” he concedes. “But I think you want to, at least at a minimum, avoid accidentally opting into a mono-perspective because you were so focused on the problem piece, you lost sight of the other makeup of that person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often the value of diversity in participant recruitment is dismissed as focusing on edge cases, says Forster, but it’s important to remain aware of these experiences, even if you choose not to solve for them right then and there. “What you decide to do with that knowledge is always in your control, but it’s better to know it than not,” he asserts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to vet your participants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in mature organizations, the vetting process for finding the right research candidate can be a struggle. “You have to figure out if people are who they say they are, are articulate, and whether they’re worth the time to talk to,” explains Forster. “When you come to User Interviews or any other solution, we’ve done all that legwork up front, and in doing so, we’ve also collected a ton of data about the people. So we’re able to do the matchmaking in a faster way as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re setting out to conduct user research without the aid of a tool like User Interviews, Forster has some wisdom to share on screening for the right candidate. “The easiest one is throwing in an open-ended prompt in your screener survey where you ask somebody to reflect on a recent experience,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An open-ended question can help identify users who not only understand the problem you’re investigating but who can articulate it in a meaningful way. “Say you’re asking a question about pizza. A person who writes in a one-word answer versus somebody who says, ‘My kid was home sick from school, and we weren’t sure what to do, we didn’t have any food. So we decided, you know what, we’ll order pizza.’ That second person is going to be much richer when you go to probe them,” says Forster. “The person who can tell you a whole story is far more valuable than the person who just uses one word.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much should we be spending on recruiting participants?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we often hear that researchers struggle to get buy-in from senior management. There are various reasons for this, and we’ve covered how to pitch research in a way that resonates with executive decision-makers in other articles. Long story short, a lot of the time, it comes down to cost and perceived ROI. With that in mind, we ask Forster about the importance of investing in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to have a research budget in place,” approaches Forster. “It’s putting a stake in the ground as a business that there’s going to be resources set aside for research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On getting buy-in, the User Interviews’ product leader leans on well-known thought-leader John Cutler for the answer. “Cutler frames this problem as a hypothetical. If you thought about a problem in your business, and it’s vital to get the answer right, if you could magically buy that data from a consulting firm, how much would you spend to get that answer?” In Cutler’s example, over the many years he’s posed this question during workshops and seminars, participants throw out huge numbers. “People say 50 grand, 60 grand—big numbers,” says Forster. “Because when you do the back of the envelope math, answers to the big questions drive conversion impact where it’s needed most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some reason, people get hung up on spending 250 bucks on incentives every other week or so. But And when you add it up, it might cost $3000 for the answer, but if you apply Cutler’s framework, $3000 is not a lot of money for a business of any size to get an answer to the big questions,” says Forster. “For whatever reason, people don’t zoom out, and research feels like an expense rather than something valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just in terms of participant recruitment. Overall, teams are still underinvesting in headcount and budget for research in general, says Forster. “Especially if you looked at the books and saw what they’re spending money on paying for. You know, there might be some random design tool that’s costing hundreds a month, and they barely use it,” he posits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you think about where that money could be deployed instead, it’s kind of striking in that regard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you think?

It’s a straightforward approach—if leadership automatically buy into company values, they can lead by example and instill them into the rest of the team. The risk of designing by committee—setting values from the ground up—is that leadership may not agree or believe in them. The values effectively become shelf-ware—released but unused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, but still, we took a different approach. Our founders, Benjamin and Brad, made a conscious decision to wait before creating values so they would accurately reflect Dovetail’s existing culture rather than be ambitious, forced, top-down founder values. They wanted the values to be impactful and utilized daily by the team. Over the past six months, with the company doubling in size and moving into our new office, we all felt the time was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to celebrate the wonderful, quirky, and sometimes weird aspects of our culture and make the implicit values we have explicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why we think values are important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re growing the team quickly, and values help build a shared understanding and keep everyone aligned as we expand. Our values should help us make decisions, whether that’s about our product and prioritizing what to build, thinking about how we scale and operate, or how we organize day-to-day work. We also want our values to determine the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dovetailapp.com/careers&quot;&gt;people we hire&lt;/a&gt;. Our values should highlight to candidates the unique ways we operate and what makes our culture different. On the flip side, our values should allow us to assess whether a candidate is the right cultural add for our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we created them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was plain for everyone who was part of the company when we already had values. They were intangible and implicit, but they were definitely there. What we needed to do was distill them and write them down. As there was already an understanding among the team about what we stood for, it made sense to go down the path of blending both team-created and founder-created values. It was essential to bring everyone along for the journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some members of the team had expressed skepticism around the concept of values. Previous experiences had shown them that well-intentioned values could be “weaponized” in bad faith. We wanted to make sure that everyone took part in their creation to feel ownership over them. Finally, we believe the best ideas are the result of highly collaborative cross-functional work, so of course, we jammed our values as a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the balance right between founder input and grassroots creation can be difficult, but luckily, I think we nailed it (and yes, that is one of our values).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Company-wide workshop&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran a full-day team event with a fully packed agenda. The outcomes we wanted from the day were to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build an understanding of what values are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have vulnerable and open discussions about our culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Draft a set of values or words and phrases that the founders can reflect upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We invited incredible external speakers, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robynemu/&quot;&gt;Robyn Dunn&lt;/a&gt;, who helped create Atlassian’s values, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierelzinga/&quot;&gt;Didier Elzinga&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Culture Amp. The pair helped steer the team in understanding why values are important, what can make a good value, and the difference between a value and a behavior. (FYI—behavior is a value in action).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, we were 18 people, so we split the team into three groups. This was an ideal size for workshops to ensure everyone could have input. In each group, we also wanted a blend of people who had been at the company a while, a mix of outspoken and reserved team members, and enough diversity to accommodate various perspectives and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran the individual workshops intending to present back a set of values representing Dovetail currently or what we should be aspiring to be. We wanted the conversations to be constructive, inclusive, and fueled by specific examples of people who liked or disliked their past work culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions used to steer the conversation included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s important to us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will help guide us when we are facing a difficult decision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the things we like about what we do at Dovetail and how we do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What parts of Dovetail are we proud of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can think of a significant decision you had to make that ultimately didn’t sit well in your mind, what’s the source of that, and what could you have changed that would clear things up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re young. Is this something we’ll still believe in five years? Ten years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this something we are willing to hire on and also fire on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this something we can apply to customer relationships? Or internal development? Or product development? Or all of the above?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each group then presented back their values to the rest of the team. We knew the team already had a solid shared understanding of who we were at Dovetail, but we were still surprised to see how similar the themes and language were across all the groups. Together, we massaged the wording to craft the first set of Dovetail values. A big thank you to our friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-rich-a5652060/&quot;&gt;Isabella Rich&lt;/a&gt; for facilitating this session. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-rich-a5652060/#&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Founder wordsmithing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin and Brad took the outputs of the company-wide workshop and spent a morning working through and defining the five values. Instead of only a single statement, they created an explanation of how the value should be used. By providing extra guidance on the meaning behind each value, we were better able to reflect the ideas put forward by the team and ensure our values are used appropriately down the track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing the values to life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of design and illustration is &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/getting-the-brand-back-together/&quot;&gt;core to our brand&lt;/a&gt;. Our in-house illustrator Lisa took on the challenge of bringing the new values to life as part of a two-day Hackathon. She designed the five posters, printed them, and got them framed for our new office, all within 30 hours. I think you’ll agree they capture our brand and reflect the uniqueness of the values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drum roll, please...here are the Dovetail values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fun fact:&lt;/b&gt; As part of our most recent Hackathon, one of our product designers, Jodie, took our values to the next level. She created an Instagram AR filter for our value posters and a &amp;quot;which Dovetail value are you&amp;quot; game. Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/hidovetail&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; to play the game, or take out your phone now and use the AR filter on the value cards above!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A guide to sharing insights in ways that stick]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/share-insights-stick</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/share-insights-stick</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The insight-sharing phase of research often receives the least focus, time, and attention in the process. After collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing all our research findings, we rush sharing to “get the insights out there” to relevant teams. All too often, this means they’re shared in ways that are neither memorable nor sticky. A few common symptoms include a confusing storyline tying together key insights, insights shared aren’t tailored to the stakeholders, or the deliverable is packed with words rather than visuals. This compromises their likelihood of being applied, dampening the impact research can have in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tackling this challenge by applying principles from education theory to insights sharing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since education theory deals with the absorption and application of data by human minds, it’s also uniquely positioned to help decision-makers in organizations absorb, understand, and retain information needed to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are four principles I’ve been applying to my insights sharing practice to make the information as sticky and actionable as possible. By allowing stakeholders to interact with insights in a variety of ways, they’ll be more likely to understand, remember, act upon, and in turn, share them further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Share your findings in a variety of learning styles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What it means&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People learn or absorb information in myriad ways. While there is no “right” way of learning, there are three learning styles that try to capture the range of ways people process information. They are: visual, auditory, tactile (and any combination thereof). By including elements of all three, I can cover a wider range of my stakeholders’ different learning styles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it can be applied&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;👀 &lt;b&gt;Visual&lt;/b&gt;: people process information best by visualizing or seeing it displayed. For example: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos of people showing emotion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motion animated graphs showing frequencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User quotes written out on slides &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persona charts &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journey maps &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;👂 &lt;b&gt;Auditory&lt;/b&gt;: people process information best by hearing it spoken to them. For example: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear, easy to follow storyline that ties the insights together &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narrating the information on the slide, or describing the visual, rather than just showing it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearing quotes from users via recordings or videos rather than just writing them out &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussing the insights with other stakeholders to hear different perspectives &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; A video recording of the insights sharing session, rather than the slides&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;👐  &lt;b&gt;Tactile&lt;/b&gt;: people process information via hands-on doing, movement, and physically engaging with information, often simply by trying things out. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking notes during the presentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insights museums” that occupy a space, whether physically in an office or virtually on a whiteboard canvas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Choose your own adventure” gamified style of user journey sharing where the stakeholders can opt for different events happening in the user’s journey to explore the different resulting experiences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flashcards or persona cards &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments to test out the insights (where possible) or prototyping them during a design sprint where insights are immediately applied to ideating a solution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I assume each insight-sharing session includes an audience of stakeholders with a variety of different learning styles. In that case, an appropriate deliverable might consist of a slide presentation with a combination of user interview video snippets, written quotes, a narrator talking through the slides, discussions of the insights in breakout rooms, and active note-taking spaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make sure your insights are relevant to stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What it means&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious that the insights we share will be more welcome if they’re relevant to the people with whom we are sharing them. But sometimes, we assume information might be relevant to stakeholders without actually making sure it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it can be applied &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before kicking off research projects, I like to take the time to do “internal research” to understand the goals of my stakeholders. I can later tie the insights and recommendations to these goals. I do this in three ways: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at how teams will be assessed over the coming quarter or year (for example, by looking at the team’s OKRs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://claytonchristensen.com/&quot;&gt;Clayton Christensen&lt;/a&gt;, former Harvard Business School Professor and author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/12/understanding-the-innovators-dilemma/&quot;&gt;The Innovator’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;, once said, “Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question—you have to want to know—in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dvtl.link/participationlio&quot;&gt;Bringing key stakeholders together for a workshop exercise&lt;/a&gt; to plot out the things they think they know about users, the things they want to know, and the impact that those answers would have on the business. This exercise has the added benefit of forcing stakeholders to come up with the questions about users (creating spaces in their minds for the answers) and simultaneously serving as an opportunity to understand which solutions would be most impactful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often during generative research, unexpected insights relevant to teams beyond the original stakeholders emerge. In this case, I set up 30-minute chats to learn about their goals, what they’re working on, and how decisions are made. Then I frame the research insights around these nuggets to speak more relevantly to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a car leasing experience project designed to help product teams prioritize feature development, some insights were relevant to sales teams. I found someone in sales whose goal was to bring more car leasing clients into the business. During our 30-minute chat, she revealed that she needed something to rally salespeople to pursue these new clients. Knowing this, I framed the insights to show how they can be applied by sales teams in pitch decks and product marketers in messaging to focus on key aspects of our product when targeting this audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Present your stakeholders with a challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What it means&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Position an insight as a challenge that the audience cares about. It’s much easier to absorb, and in turn, more galvanizing to act upon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it can be applied&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share the challenges that users face, the magnitude of pain the challenges cause, and the resulting implications using narration, video, audio clips, quotes, and photos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once needed to convey how much lease car drivers struggled with slow and unresponsive support. I demonstrated the challenge of the owners in three distinct ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colorful, simple journey map showing a flat line that suddenly drops, portraying the magnitude of impact support has on their experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three videos of participants explaining in colorful detail the experience of not receiving support quickly enough&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three full-slide direct user quotes about the monetary and time implications of slow support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Choose quality over quantity of insights shared &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stick to sharing no more than three key challenges in an insight sharing session. More than that can lead to information overload. To narrow them down, I prioritize the challenges based on the amount of pain to users and the feasibility of resolving them—looping in relevant stakeholders to help make this assessment. We often end up with an impact—feasibility matrix like the one below.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move people with personal stories rather than statistics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What it means&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that people donate more money to causes when they are shown one individual their donation would be supporting, rather than a flurry of statistics, charts, and graphs that de-personalize the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it can be applied&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, rather than only showing how many times drivers complained about support, how many tickets they submitted, and how many times it came up in the interviews, I played a video of a single mom explaining in passionate detail the ramifications the slow support has had on the security and happiness of her family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People repeat actions associated with rewards&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What it means&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with anything, when there is an incentive attached to a behavior, that behavior will become more likely. B.J. Fogg’s behavioral model visualized this notion in the graph below. A desired behavior will occur when a person has the motivation, ability, and prompt, all at once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it can be applied&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want stakeholders to apply research insights to decisions. In that case, the insights sharing session can be the “prompt,” ensuring the insights are shared with people with the ability to act upon them can be the “ability,” and peer approval can be a strong motivator for stakeholders to act upon the insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I believe everyone ultimately wants to give users the best possible experience by resolving their challenges, these good intentions can sometimes be buried under a long backlog of other priorities. In this situation, I’ve found that sharing user challenges far and wide beyond immediate stakeholders can be a helpful nudge to turn insights into solutions, as it creates an environment where stakeholders can keep each other accountable for addressing user challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating more recognition for the research practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing insights in a variety of ways does justice to all the hard work that goes into research. It packages insights in ways that aid their absorption and increases the chance decision-makers will use them. In my experience, this multifaceted insight-sharing approach has the added benefit of creating more visibility and recognition for the research practice within organizations—and nothing is quite as motivating as seeing hard work being put to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Katarina Bagherian, User Experience Research Team Lead, Adyen. &lt;/b&gt;Katarina leads the Research team at Adyen.

I can’t even begin to count the number of research interviews I have conducted over the past eight years. They are my absolute favorite method for understanding the problem-space and peeking into users’ brains and inner workings. Settling into a generative research session feels so comfy for me, and I genuinely look forward to each one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t always that way, however. I stuttered and stumbled through so many one-on-one interviews before I eventually found my rhythm and beat. It wasn’t pretty. I failed my first generative interview altogether. Through the years, I asked leading questions, had awkward pauses trying to search for the right question, asked participants to predict the future, and annoyed some participants by asking the same question repeatedly when I couldn’t think of what I should say next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this to say, like any other skill, this type of methodology takes a lot of practice. It’s not something you learn in a workshop or course and can immediately do with confidence. It takes time to evolve your particular style of interviewing. My best advice is to practice with friends, family, or whenever you are speaking with colleagues. Luckily, there are some best practices in mind that we can apply to all conversations to build that generative research muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to improve your sessions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my first generative interviews, I was trying to keep my head above water. I was learning how to ask open-ended questions and, essentially, relearning how to have a conversation, but in a structured and professional environment. I had to apply what I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias&quot;&gt;biases&lt;/a&gt; carefully to present my team with valid and reliable insights. I felt an immense amount of pressure to get these interviews right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the years, I have found approaches and guidelines that I apply to make my generative research sessions successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Active listening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t have a successful generative research interview without learning how to listen actively. Active listening means going beyond just hearing the words the person is saying; you are also looking for the meaning they are communicating. During a research session, the participant should have your complete attention. I take away any distractions so I can focus on everything the person is saying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will occasionally nod and say “okay” or “uh-huh” to indicate I am listening during the session. I try not to use positive indicators to listening because this can bias the participant into thinking they are doing a “good job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, do your best not to interrupt the participant. Think about times when you were interrupted while trying to explain something. Interruption is frustrating and stops the person from conveying their complete message. Let the participant finish before asking clarifying or follow-up questions. This technique works when talking to colleagues too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repeat and mirror&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirroring is imitation in the most basic form. We unconsciously copy each other to bond, provide comfort, and build trust. We do this by imitating body language, tone of voice, speech, and vocabulary. Repeat the last one-to-three essential words the person said (or a small phrase). As an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participant&lt;/b&gt;: “I hate how I can’t easily return what I bought from your website!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Researcher&lt;/b&gt;: “Can’t easily return?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participant&lt;/b&gt;: “Yeah, the forms are impossible to get to, and I never know which to use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Researcher&lt;/b&gt;: “Impossible to get to?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participant&lt;/b&gt;: “Your website doesn’t let me easily search for obvious keywords, so I can’t find anything when I need help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Researcher&lt;/b&gt;: “Obvious keywords?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you do this, you trigger an instinct, which automatically makes the person you talk to elaborate on their thought. This technique is an excellent replacement for asking “why” or “what do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;TEDW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years back, I attended a training session that taught this acronym to help form open-ended questions on the spot. When you use these phrases to begin your questions, it helps you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-should-always-aim-for-open-ended-conversations-331321cdbd7?sk=80cce43d1a0afffa78c4d7ee4dc13816&quot;&gt;open-ended conversations&lt;/a&gt; with participants and reveals stories and insights. The letters stand for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tell me...” or “Talk me through...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Explain...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Describe...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walk me through...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embrace silence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence is golden and is one of the best ways to get people to elaborate on their thoughts. It also ensures you won’t interrupt the participant, especially if you are running the interview remotely and there may be a delay due to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use silence all the time. Every time a participant finishes a sentence, I count to three slowly in my head before responding. This silence gives them time to continue elaborating on their thought if there was more. Since people like to fill the silence, the participant will most likely continue talking to explain what they were saying, meaning you don’t even have to ask!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do a dry run (or two)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting a dry run before your first interview of a study can help you establish your flow, find the kinks in the script, and get you to feel more confident about the upcoming sessions. To this day, I still do a dry run or two, depending on the complexity of the subject. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do my best to find a dry run participant in which the subject is applicable. For example, if I am testing a grocery e-commerce delivery service, I would ask any colleagues if they use something similar. If you can’t find any colleagues (or if you are a freelancer), reach out to friends, family, or your network. When I worked at a b2b company, I would reach out to account managers or customer support since they typically had the most touch-points with customers and the software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listen to podcast interviews  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way I started to improve my interviews was to listen to how others interviewed people. Now, take this with a grain of salt because not all podcast hosts are looking to be unbiased. More often than not, I hear podcast hosts asking leading, double-barrelled, biased questions all the time. But, this is a great practice to understand and identify what you shouldn’t be doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bonus is to listen to user research podcasts to see how user researchers are interviewing their guests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions to avoid (and what to do instead)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as there are techniques to apply to your interview skills, there are specific questions to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes/No questions or closed questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes/no questions and closed questions don’t allow participants to tell stories or give you rich data about their motivations. These kinds of questions shut down the conversation and can make participants feel unheard. Instead, have a list of open-ended questions ready and use the TEDW technique to phrase your questions. Another piece of advice is to start questions with the word “how.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that I sometimes still ask these questions by mistake. Whenever I have done it, I notice and always try to make up for it by asking an open-ended question after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asking about the future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of good intention, sometimes it can be easy to fall into the future-based question trap. You want to get answers and give guidance to your team. Sadly, not only are future-based questions completely unreliable and hypothetical, they can be pretty uncomfortable for users to answer and may lead to some social desirability bias. A few future-based questions I see regularly are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you use [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often would you use [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you buy [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to buy [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much would you pay for [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you pay X for [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, turn all of these questions into past tense! The past is the best predictor of future behavior. Instead of asking users how often they might use a feature or how much they might pay for something, we should reference their past. Here is how these questions can be much more effective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe a time you used a similar [feature/service/product/app].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often have you used a similar [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell me about the last time you bought a similar [feature/service/product/app].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much have you paid for a similar [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you paid for a similar [feature/service/product/app]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said, practice makes perfect. My generative research interviews got better when I stopped trying to make them so perfect and focused on my sense of curiosity. I wanted to learn as much about each person and the subject we were covering. This genuine sense of curiosity and using the above techniques helped me find my interviewing style and become very comfortable as a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to synthesize data like a pro through affinity diagramming]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synthesis is the mysterious and untouchable part of user research. The synthesis process often gets glazed over in presentations or elicits moans and eye rolls from researchers, regardless of seniority. It’s a touchy subject. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first learned about user research, I was baffled at how researchers went from interviews to these beautiful, concise statements called insights. The hours I spent speaking to participants amounted to piles of data. I couldn&amp;#39;t understand how to make this raw data into insights or find those notorious patterns and trends I kept hearing about. I walked around with a question mark above my head, trying to present raw data in a way that wasn&amp;#39;t overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, someone told me to cluster important information from the interviews, resulting in clear and actionable insights. I had so many questions. How did I know what was important? What is clustering? What is an actionable insight (that one still gets me)? And how do I not overwhelm myself with reviewing all this information?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after much trial and error, and before Google helped surface user research-related content, I found out about affinity diagramming. With those two words, everything in my synthesis process started to change and improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is affinity diagramming?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/solution/affinity-mapping/&quot;&gt;affinity diagram&lt;/a&gt; is a visual brainstorming tool that allows teams to organize large amounts of data into groups or themes based on their relationships. They are perfect for making sense of the mess of qualitative data I mentioned above because they are all about bundling and grouping similar information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affinity diagrams give you a way to filter through all your qualitative data and see what patterns and trends emerge. During this exercise, you will look through your notes and organize related information into clear groups and themes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One remarkable facet of affinity diagrams is that you can use them alone or with a group of stakeholders. I have used affinity diagrams by myself to organize my thoughts after a research project. I have also pulled stakeholders into affinity diagramming to synthesis research in a group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the concept of affinity diagrams is abstract, I learned how to do affinity diagrams through practice and experimenting. So get your qualitative data and let&amp;#39;s go through an example!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to create an affinity diagram &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into creating an affinity diagram, there are a few concepts to address and steps to prepare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started using affinity diagrams, I struggled to figure out what &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; information meant. How was I supposed to start sifting through all this data and seemingly know when something was important? That is where tags come into play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are tags?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags can have several different names, such as codes or themes. Essentially, they are ways to code information into a single word. For example, let&amp;#39;s say we are researching how people plan travel. When you look through your notes, you might find quite a few people said a similar thing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When the travel gets complex, I use a travel agent, even if they cost money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If I have multiple stops or dealing with multiple airlines and it is complicated, I use a travel agent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will only use a travel agent when I am booking lots of different trips within the same holiday, and there are moving parts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I use a travel agent when traveling with my family on a longer holiday because doing it myself is just too complicated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see this information come up repeatedly in your notes, you can start to code this with the words &amp;quot;travel agent,&amp;quot; as these statements are all related to hiring a travel agent for trip planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there are common tags you could use if you don&amp;#39;t want to create your own. When I was starting in user research, I used these tags (and still do!):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal&lt;/b&gt;–what the person is trying to accomplish as an outcome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Motivation&lt;/b&gt;–why the person is trying to achieve that goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Core value&lt;/b&gt;–how that motivation or accomplishment makes them feel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Need&lt;/b&gt;–something a person needs to fulfill a goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pain point&lt;/b&gt;–a barrier or difficulty towards accomplishing a goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Task&lt;/b&gt;–something a person does to achieve a goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tools&lt;/b&gt;–a tool a person uses to try to accomplish a goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Positive emotion&lt;/b&gt;–something that makes a person feel positively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see similar information coming up more than four times, it becomes &lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt;. For example, if we heard four or more participants talking about travel agents, that would become a trend and pattern in the research worth looking into. Generally, I like to focus on four to five tags per affinity diagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The process (with an example!)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you decide if you will create your tags or use the ones above in the list, the process of affinity diagramming can begin. Here is my step-by-step guide on how to create an affinity diagram through an example. Keep in mind that all of the data shown here is fake data for example purposes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s go back to the above example of working at a travel company and exploring how people plan travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have decided to go with the predetermined tags from above, and I will focus on pain points, motivations, goals, needs, and tasks as the main tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gather the notes I&amp;#39;ve taken for each participant and review them. I code the qualitative data into these tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once each participant is reviewed, I get out my post-its (and the fun begins). Starting with pain points, I go through each participant and write &lt;i&gt;one pain point per post-it&lt;/i&gt;. I include the participant number on the post-it. I do this for each participant and each tag. For example, I go through the data for pain points, and my post-its might read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;—Never know when to book tickets because the prices keep going up and down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P3&lt;/b&gt;—The fluctuation in prices is frustrating because it makes it hard to know when to book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P5&lt;/b&gt;—Trying to figure out when to book tickets and the right timing for the best price &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P6&lt;/b&gt;—Seeing the prices go down after I purchased&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P2&lt;/b&gt;—I hate trying to make changes to my flights because of the fees &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P3&lt;/b&gt;—Getting a refund on a trip is impossible because there is always a loophole, and I have to pay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P5&lt;/b&gt;—Last minute changes or refunds to a trip are the worst - I can never get a refund, even if I feel like I have a good reason&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;P7&lt;/b&gt;—Customer support with changing trip details or canceling a trip is so stressful - they never let you do it without a fee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I create all the post-its for the tags (pain points, goals, motivations), I put each of the post-its under their relevant group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I have put all the post-its into their groups, I create clusters of similar ideas. If you look at the example pain points I listed above, you can see two distinct groups emerging, a pain point about fluctuating prices and a pain point about making changes to flights. I put all of these similar post-its together and create a group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do this for each group (pain points, goals, motivations, needs) until I have clustered everything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I review the clusters, and those with four or more post-its become the most vital information to focus on from the qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have completed an affinity diagram, you can see which trends and, thus, the most important insights are that came out of your study. This process will ensure you report on the crucial information and that your teams know what to prioritize from the research. Keep practicing and, soon, affinity diagramming will become second nature!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://researchops.community/about/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;community began in March 2018&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/katetowsey/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kate Towsey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Research Operations Manager at Atlassian. Since then, the ResearchOps community has orchestrated large-scale surveys, presented workshops around the world, and built a thriving community of over 8,000 individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In multiple aspects, this emerging discipline shares parallels with UX Research in its early days: its professionals are still defining the responsibilities and scope of their roles while their cross-functional partners are still learning how to collaborate with these teams. We see both commonalities and differences when looking at how the related practice of DesignOps operates at companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.google/jobs/design-producer/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/facebook-design-program-management&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Facebook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/tagged/designops&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Salesforce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the core mission of ResearchOps appears to stay consistent across organizations: to alleviate the operational burdens of user research so its practitioners can focus on practicing their craft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mission has taken shape in the form of specific duties through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/researchops-community/the-eight-pillars-of-user-research-1bcd2820d75a&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eight pillars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of ResearchOps teams: governance; budget management; knowledge management; participant recruitment; tooling, physical space, and asset management; guidelines, templates and documentation; internal communications; and team and people management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Top ResearchOps specialists &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the field of UX as a whole, ResearchOps embraces individuals from all backgrounds to become practitioners. Not only is the field too new to be taught in traditional academic programs or bootcamps, but diverse backgrounds actually enrich ResearchOps practitioners’ ability to approach and solve ambiguous problems. Prior experience—whether as a project or program manager in a different field—or even a further flung past position can be applicable in ResearchOps. Regardless of one’s background, here are traits of top ResearchOps professionals and tips for cultivating these qualities in oneself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Organized&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This characteristic is arguably an asset to any professional endeavor, however, it’s especially crucial for ResearchOps practitioners. As the owners of essential research, responsibilities include but are not limited to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participant scheduling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incentivization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Storage and processing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insight archiving and sharing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Template management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these complex organizational tasks in mind, the ability to arrange things in a structured manner becomes key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving one’s organizational skills can be equal parts strategy/mindset and tactics/tools. Helpful paradigms to adopt when it comes to fostering a more organized mindset center around thinking of ways to bring order, systems, and arrangements to all aspects of one’s work. Organizing from a tactical standpoint encompasses standardized file naming structure, uniform file location practices, and frequent audits to minimize digital clutter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the best tools to stay organized can vary based on individual preferences and workflows, it’s hard to go wrong with classics like a pen and paper to log information, emails and Slack messages for communications, and a calendar to keep track of deadlines and meetings. Furthermore, ResearchOps specific tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-repository/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dovetail’s Research Repository&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be invaluable for storing, organizing, and sharing customer insights while Dovetail’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/manage-your-participants/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;People feature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eases the challenge of tracking and managing participants.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Proactive&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As pioneers in a growing discipline, ResearchOps practitioners should be proactive problem solvers. Oftentimes, a precedent won’t exist for solving a challenging problem, there won’t be documentation for best practices on how to handle a situation, and one won’t have a colleague who’s previously tackled the unique scenario you’re facing. In spite of this, we can take inspiration from&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-tackle-researchops-in-a-rapidly-scaling-organization/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; A’verria Maritn, Ph.D, Director at ServiceNow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Channeling our inner designers. &lt;/b&gt;Applying human-centered design and design thinking processes to addressing challenges we face or new opportunities we identify. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being agile. &lt;/b&gt;Don’t let perfection be the enemy of getting things done—prototype a template, process, or workflow then iterate based on feedback from your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;ResearchOps professionals must also be proactive in terms of identifying and mitigating potential risks within current or upcoming initiatives. Improving at this skill is a product of harboring relationships with cross-functional partners in conjunction with questioning assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;User centric&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ResearchOps specialists might not directly conduct user research like the colleagues they support, yet they are a crucial member of the UX department and key to delivering outstanding user experiences. As such, a user-centric focus and all the traits that come with this way of thinking: empathy, curiosity, ideating, and testing solutions will enhance the understanding of the nature of their team’s work. Moreover, it can supercharge the quality of one’s ResearchOps deliverables and practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing a user-centric mindset takes time and practice. One can begin by making a conscious effort to better understand those around you and their perspectives free of judgement. This includes connecting with a diverse group of individuals, asking thoughtful questions and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/ux-research-leader-and-author-of-listen-like-you-mean-it-ximena-vengoechea/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;listening like we mean it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the process, we reduce our judgment, gain new insights into the world, and influence better outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once this mindset becomes second nature, one might consider crafting a toolkit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.designkit.org/methods&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;design thinking methods &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to apply in their own work and keeping up to date on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;current articles related to the field of user research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Emotionally intelligent&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ResearchOps is a team sport. It requires widespread collaboration not only with the UX Research team but stakeholders from Legal, IT, and beyond. Thus, the ability to foster meaningful relationships with cross-functional partners becomes essential. ResearchOps practitioners are strong communicators with an acute awareness of their colleagues’ needs and priorities. They become much more than owners of processes and documentation: they are trusted allies for feedback and masters of getting things done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building emotional intelligence can serve as a lifelong skill in both professional and personal capacities. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/02/emotional-intelligence-has-12-elements-which-do-you-need-to-work-on&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Harvard Business Review article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; touches on the 12 elements of Emotional Intelligence, while Daniel Goldman’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/kgs/1aXocM&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emotional Intelligence 2.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a well-validated resource for those interested in delving deep into this space. Improving one’s EQ (emotional quotient) is tied closely to advancing skills in self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Just the beginning &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re currently practicing ResearchOps or aspiring to transition into this role, it’s an incredible time to be interested in it. What practitioners do, create, and share today will undoubtedly impact the future of UX Research and be key to its growth. The responsibilities and scope of its practitioners will continue evolving, but these key traits of effective practitioners are likely to remain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What traits have you found key to becoming a strong ResearchOps practitioner?

When I was working as a solo researcher, I had requests coming in from 12 teams and precariously balanced three to four projects at once. Soon, I was stretched beyond my limits, and it led to mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, I walked into a research session thinking we were testing one prototype, only to be reminded by my confused colleagues that I had the wrong prototype open. I felt terrible for my teams and participants. Luckily, I switched the topics and completed the usability test, but I knew something had to change.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I quickly realized I could not create and conduct all research studies equally. I had to streamline and operationalize my research process if I was going to handle all these requests and ensure I was doing the most impactful research for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How I streamlined my process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to audit my current process. Back then, I had people requesting projects via email, Slack, or just approaching my desk. I didn’t have a prioritization process, a backlog, or any overview of what was currently happening and the timelines. Most of the time, I did everything from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this took up an unbelievable amount of time. It also led to one of the worst places to spend time: meetings (lots of them). Since people would write me one to two lines about a research request, I would have to schedule a follow-up meeting to further understand it. Since I didn’t have a shared document, I would take notes but inevitably forget to ask this or that question, which would lead to more meetings or interruptive conversations. Ultimately, I would try to figure out when I was doing what and how to fit projects into my Tetris-like timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My process—if you could call it that—was a nightmare and a headache. Here are the steps I took to improve and streamline my process continuously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Audit what you are doing and figure out what isn’t working.&lt;/b&gt; The first thing I had to do was understand where I was going wrong and what my biggest pain points were in my process. Doing this helped me understand what took most of my time (spoiler: meetings), and what I could do to fix it. Look at your current process to know where you need to streamline and operationalize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Send a shared intake document for requests. &lt;/b&gt;Creating an intake document saved me hours of meetings and thousands of messages. Whenever someone wants to request a research project, I send them &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/10IwzR_zC7sNZj4Js_s49Vgu0k5XE5-M4EsAJqr62cyw/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this document&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to fill out to get as much information up-front and start prioritizing without a single meeting. Another perk of this document is that it encourages asynchronous work, so people can leave questions and comments instead of having a formal meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have a straightforward prioritization method.&lt;/b&gt; Before, I had no idea if I was conducting essential research for the organization. I would take on projects without understanding their potential impact and what choosing one project over another meant. I put into place a clear prioritization method that all my colleagues had access to. Once I received a request and cleared up any questions, I plugged it into this &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aYbpBcy6BMtobmcuLaCM8GYmAGYqlbiowI-s57HZNsA/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;prioritization template&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to assess whether I should take on the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create a research roadmap and backlog. &lt;/b&gt;Like any other product team, I learned that I needed to know what I was currently doing, what timelines I was operating in, and what was coming up next. This information wasn’t only important to me but also my teams. I created a research roadmap, showing all current and future projects. The roadmap helped me understand where my time was going, if I could slot in another small project, and if I was balancing evaluative and generative research. Also, by creating a backlog, I quickly filled in new, important projects in case timelines were shifted last minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use templates for as much as possible.&lt;/b&gt; Whenever you can, use a template! I created canned responses for recruitment emails and had templates for almost everything. Not only did this help me during the research process, but it also enabled other team members to do tasks, freeing up more of my time. Check out some of my templates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-5onX1XgjtJuq64wVgFsrA2qk3F7VFn-8hCnumxkZY/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Recruitment emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BIPXdiLU5GkSsv_SX9MToVNvXp-UwX459X_opSch-Rs/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Consent form&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_2S5c-LWhwEk86oMxemgwsYHcm6CG_rwut5TLz0byY/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set up a research plan. &lt;/b&gt;A research plan is the North Star of a project and keeps you aligned with your team. Research plans keep the entire team focused on an outcome and provide an easy reference to keep “need-to-know” stakeholders in the know. They prevent everyone from getting bogged down in the details and switching the research goal in the middle by mistake. Most importantly, they allow researchers (or whoever is doing the research) to ensure the research plan’s objectives will be answered as effectively and efficiently as possible by the end of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask for tools that help you. &lt;/b&gt;There are some software and tools you can use to further streamline your process. For example, I use Calendly in conjunction with my recruitment emails for easy scheduling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking into and changing my process positively impacted my work. I felt much more capable of helping others, staying on top of projects and requests, and better handling what I was working on and why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to avoid streamlining&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although teams and colleagues want research done and insights delivered in short timelines, there are some areas in which we can’t cut corners. Regardless of the fast pace of technology and product companies, research needs rigor and that means taking time during certain parts of the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the steps that I take more time on and don’t streamline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Writing a screener survey.&lt;/b&gt; I never skip this step. Without understanding who you want to speak to and a proper screener survey, you could jeopardize the entire study. Take the time to ensure you are recruiting the right people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthesis and analysis. &lt;/b&gt;Every hour-long research session requires two hours of analysis and synthesis. I know that we all wish synthesis could be shorter, but this is the part in which we have to apply rigor. If we don’t take our time synthesizing results, we could create the wrong insights or inform teams with incorrect information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating video/audio clips.&lt;/b&gt; Video and audio clips are the best ways to capture colleagues’ attention and help them understand users. I always make video clips, especially around particular pain points. Investing in this means you will have an increased chance that teams take your work seriously and act on it.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways we can help ourselves and others on the team by taking a look at our workflows and trying to improve them. I didn’t achieve this overnight! It took time and effort to make my process better, but it was completely worth it in the end. Now I can assess, prioritize, and move forward with a request in a 24- to 48-hour turnaround—a dream for my teams! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

It’s the first subject on the syllabus in UX 101. But are we truly considering the full possibilities of who our users are? Are we being thoroughly inclusive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re inclusive, we consider the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age, and other forms of human difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping inclusivity in mind as we conduct research (and then build products, services, and experiences), we can unlock a greater understanding of who our users are. We can better define their needs, mindsets, and expectations. Not only will you look smarter and more in tune with your users, but your users will also feel seen and understood in return. Plus, when we focus on creating experiences to accommodate specific needs better, often the experience becomes better for &lt;i&gt;everyone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inclusivity is good for business&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being inclusive isn’t solely about being a good human—it’s good for business. In her book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Building+For+Everyone%3A+Expand+Your+Market+With+Design+Practices+From+Google%27s+Product+Inclusion+Team-p-9781119646228&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Building For Everyone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Product Inclusion at Google Annie Jean-Baptiste asserts that organizations who focus on building products and experiences that consider the diversity of the world and center on inclusion “have the opportunity to tap into trillions of dollars of global spend being left on the table by less-enlightened organizations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/writing-is-designing/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Writing is Designing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; Andy Welfle and Michael J. Metts point out that when you exclude even one-tenth of one percent of the world’s population, that means there are about “755 million people who are less able to (or can’t) use your product, or pay for your service or experience your interface.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here’s an example of how that translates into dollars. According to a 2018 report from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.air.org/system/files/downloads/report/Hidden-Market-Spending-Power-of-People-with-Disabilities-April-2018.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Institute for Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, disposable income for adults with disabilities totals US$500 billion. Jean-Baptiste ups that total on the global scale to about US$1 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put: it’s a good business strategy to build authentic inclusive practices, products, and experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best practices for inclusivity in UX research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; As any good UXer knows, a great experience starts with rock-solid research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Baptiste notes, “The ultimate goal is to build an inclusive product, and you do that by building inclusion into the people and processes that design the product.” To be more inclusive in our experiences, we have to start with being inclusive in our research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Baptiste provides a solid process to conduct research in an inclusive way. The basics are the same: understand your goal, define your audience, build your sample, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques/&quot;&gt;choose your research method&lt;/a&gt;, conduct said research, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-fast-reliable-collaborative-analysis/&quot;&gt;analyze and share results&lt;/a&gt;. Within that process, there are a few ways we can prioritize inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Always ask who isn’t in the room&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you approach a study, ask who isn’t in the room. Who’s perspectives or experiences are missing? You should apply this to both your team (more on that in a minute) and your audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take this example. If your goal is to understand how users navigate a website to find certain information, but you don’t consider those with poor vision or who use screen readers, you lose important user information. The research is insufficient, which could mean you’re excluding valuable users. The more user experiences you can account for, the more thoroughly you can understand their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our experiences to be truly inclusive of a lived experience, we have to include those perspectives from the start. As James I. Charlton wrote, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520224810/nothing-about-us-without-us&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“Nothing about us without us.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: Understand what perspectives are missing from your research.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make your team more diverse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you know who isn’t in the room, try to get them there! It’s a simple concept, but it can be hard to execute. In any way you can, get diverse voices on your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you don’t have the budget to hire more researchers or contractors. Who else at your organization can you ask for help? Be mindful you don’t tokenize people. Consider how you can partner with your colleagues in an intentional way that makes them feel included. Maybe this looks like sending out a request for collaboration that explains the study and how you’re looking for more perspectives to ensure you get it right.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring diverse perspectives are represented on your team also makes your research better. When the researcher can relate to the experience of the user, they can ask better follow-up questions or see data trends that those who don’t have the same lived experience might miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re interviewing someone who doesn’t speak English as their first language and you ask how quickly they were able to “get up and running,” they might be confused by the turn of phrase. It may seem innocuous to a native English speaker but could leave the subject confused and feeling excluded. A researcher who has a similar lived experience can likely better navigate questions or help prevent the situation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more diverse perspectives you can bring into your work, the stronger it’ll be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: Make your team more diverse through hiring or collaboration.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Account for intersectional identities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so up to this point you identified who was missing and got them in the room or made sure they were accounted for in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/recruiting-participants-user-research/&quot;&gt;study sample&lt;/a&gt;. You know who you want to speak with and who is helping guide those conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you start your research, account for intersectional identities. Recognize that a Black 28-year-old woman who makes $80,000 a year living in Seattle has a different experience from a Black 28-year-old woman who makes $80,000 a year living in London. In this example, there is one difference, but it’s an important distinction. These two women navigate the world with different needs and preferences because they’re rooted in different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we understand how these different identities interact, we can better hone our research to address challenges or opportunities. As a result, we can bring forth key insights we may have missed—insights that will likely result in a better experience or design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: Understand how needs change based on the different identities people have and include them in your work. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Consider your research method’s limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I told you I could count on my hands how often my grad school professor said to not let the method drive the research, I’d be lying. We know we need to focus our research method on the goal and the question at hand. And we need to consider if there are limitations to how we best reach our audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider how much of your research relies on web access and web tools. Does that meet your audience’s needs? What if they don’t have a computer and rely on mobile devices? What if they use a screen reader or other technology because navigating web pages is difficult? Is there anything special you need to do to reach your intended audience better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you’re trying to understand what features users need for an app centered on housing resources? How do you recruit the right people? Is a web survey the right method? What if you went to the neighborhood where the people lived to speak with them directly or offered ways for them to take the survey on the spot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By taking this extra step, you can ensure your results accurately represent the needs of your audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: Consider how to best reach your intended audience for better results.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You won’t be perfect, that’s ok&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, these are some best practices. You won’t get it right 100 percent of the time. It might not be possible. Do your best and recognize there will always be room for improvement. The more you can harness inclusive practices, the more your research—and ultimately your experiences—will be better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Kelly Erickson, Senior Content Designer, PTC. &lt;/b&gt;Kelly is a Senior Content Designer at PTC.

We had set up bi-weekly user research chats, where I provided some structure and mentorship to help these new researchers navigate the tricky world they just recently entered. I sipped my hot chocolate and listened to them talk through picking methodologies and begging colleagues to come to research sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a collective sigh from the group when one of them turned to me and said, “It must be so nice not to feel like an impostor. To not feel like you’re constantly messing up. When do you think we will feel that way?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven pairs of shiny eyes stared back at me, and I knew what I was going to say would disappoint them. I took a deep breath and said, “Honestly, I still feel like an imposter sometimes. Yes, it occurs less often now, but there are days where I wonder and question my skills.” Although that wasn’t what they wanted to hear, I think it offered a sense of relief for them. Anyone who is feeling imposter syndrome is never alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is imposter syndrome?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impostor syndrome, otherwise known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome, or impostor experience (fun, light names), is a “psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments, and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a ‘fraud,’ despite external evidence of their knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impostor syndrome can particularly impact perfectionists, experts, and people who try to do it alone (soloists). However, everyone can (and most do) experience impostor syndrome when trying something new, transitioning to a new field, changing jobs, graduating from school, and many other similar experiences. As you can see, this phenomenon can happen to anyone, even if you are experiencing a small change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does this manifest in user research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started feeling impostor syndrome when I decided to transition into the field of user research. I secured a master’s degree in psychology and went through a certified boot camp at General Assembly. I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/ux/ux-researcher/&quot;&gt;ready to jump into becoming a user researcher!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months and 70 failed job applications later, I felt like a fraud. I asked myself questions like, “Why did I think I would be good at this job?” or “why did I think anyone would want to hire someone like me?” I went down this rabbit hole for a few weeks, constantly second-guessing myself and any applicable skills I had learned. Eventually, I clawed my way out with a successful interview and secured an internship as a user researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, impostor syndrome does not just go away when you get a job. Through the years, I have encountered impostor syndrome throughout my entire career. I believe it is widespread in the user research space especially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As user researchers, we get hit constantly with contradictory information on our practice. One day the NPS should be used as a measure of satisfaction, the next day, the NPS is the worst indicator, and we should be using better metrics. For a while, focus groups were a cool and valuable method, and now they are frowned upon. Also, we should, ideally, be taking two hours to synthesize a one-hour interview. Still, we also need to be fast enough to provide teams with actionable, digestible, nugget-sized information every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also questioned so many times along the way. How can we be sure about insights when we only have a sample size of seven? How can we know whether people will use this feature if we don’t just ask them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These situations can weigh on you as a researcher and make you constantly question yourself. And that can be exhausting. With this pressure, it isn’t a surprise that we can feel like a fraud or undeserving of a particular role or responsibility. I remember being so &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation/&quot;&gt;nervous about presentations&lt;/a&gt; because I didn’t want to explain the number of participants I recruited or justify why colleagues should listen to my results. I wished that user research just meant talking to users and not reporting on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How it feels eight years later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some good news; it does get better! Hurrah! But I do still feel glimpses of impostor syndrome, especially when I am joining a new company or stepping into a new type of role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a year ago, I let go of my operational research responsibilities and made the leap to be a manager. I was terrified. Before starting, I questioned whether or not I would be a good manager and if I was deserving of the title. I was concerned I wouldn’t be good enough and would ruin someone’s development and career. I asked myself why this company hired me to do something like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also days where I question basic research skills, like writing a good research question or helping stakeholders go from business needs to user problems. I look at some big presentations and wonder if they are impactful or effective. Just the other week, I asked myself if a big project I was taking on even made sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, eight years later, I still question myself as a user researcher; I still wonder if I am doing a good job or doing things the “right” way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the biggest difference now is that I know it is okay to have doubts because there is no “right” way to do anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feeling like a fraud?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying you are never alone in this feeling. About 80 percent of people will encounter imposter syndrome at least once in their lifetime. However, this is not an emotion that can necessarily be solved by “strength in numbers.” It is generally a feeling you keep to yourself. Most people with impostorism feelings suffer in silence. No one wants to talk about it because part of the experience is the fear someone will find out they are a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most importantly, there are ways to ease this feeling and embrace the fear of failure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try a different method or push yourself to present research in a new way. Think of your actions as experiments. That way, it can be easier to deal with when they might not work out perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how to take feedback in stride. It is okay if someone didn’t like something you did. Take the time to understand why and consider how you could improve it for next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Own and celebrate your achievements and successes as a user researcher—even the small ones!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See yourself as a work-in-progress. No one is perfect and knows all the answers to everything. I Google things, too, every once and a while. You are constantly learning and evolving, so it’s okay not to know the answer to everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know, ask for help. It’s okay to seek help from managers, colleagues, mentors, and even strangers! If you are struggling with a particular project, there is likely someone out there who can help you work through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember you are the expert on this subject. If colleagues have opinions on what or how you should be doing something, that’s great to keep in mind, but ultimately, you are the expert, and the decisions you make are valid based on your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your head up and follow the golden rule of user experience: iterate, fail, iterate, fail, iterate, win for a bit, iterate, fail, iterate, succeed a little more. By doing this, you are not an impostor. And, you are never alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Nikki Anderson, User Research Lead &amp;amp; Instructor. &lt;/b&gt;Nikki is a User Research Lead and Instructor with over eight years of experience.

We are constantly reaffirming, reshaping, or dismissing narratives about the world, ourselves, other people—everything. Though the word “story” conjures up images of children’s bedtime tales, there’s far more to it. Stories are powerful vehicles for ideas and beliefs. The author Yuval Harari writes, “Homo sapiens is a storytelling animal that thinks in stories rather than in numbers or graphs, and believes that the universe itself works like a story.” The more we understand the threads of narrative around us, the more we can pull, tug, and weave them into big concepts that shape our lives and the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bencrothers.com/&quot;&gt;Ben Crothers&lt;/a&gt; understands this. That’s why he has spent his professional life developing his storytelling style. A designer, strategist, facilitator, trainer, and author, Crothers has mastered the many different mediums of story. Most notably, he’s known for visual communication, a topic he wrote on in his educational text, &lt;a href=&quot;http://prestosketching.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Presto Sketching: The Magic of Simple Drawing for Brilliant Product Thinking and Design&lt;/a&gt;, a book jam-packed full of methods and techniques to tell stories using simple drawing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We rallied Crothers to help us dissect the inner workings of story, and importantly, to learn how to apply the principles of good storytelling to the workplace. If employed adeptly, storytelling can be a powerful tool to help work better with your colleagues, present ideas, and ultimately heighten the impact of your output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tips for better storytelling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listen to your organization’s internal stories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Great storytellers help us understand the world around us. They help us connect with who we are and where we’re at,” Crothers begins. “They help us make meaning out of all the mess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are well-positioned to be great storytellers. As accomplished listeners and empaths, they are not only adept at communicating customer stories, but they are also able to understand the internal stories within a business and translate them into something meaningful. Every organization has an internal narrative. Some of that narrative might come out in highly-groomed pieces, like vision and values. But it’s the unspoken, un-groomed pieces that researchers should help articulate, says Crothers. This is about showing where business and customer stories are connected and where they aren’t. Austrian management consultant Peter Drucker called the idea of an internal business narrative the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/1994/09/the-theory-of-the-business&quot;&gt;Theory of the Business&lt;/a&gt;. This is the operating &lt;i&gt;raison d&amp;#39;&lt;/i&gt;ê&lt;i&gt;tre&lt;/i&gt;, the driving story, or the internal values upon which a business functions. According to Drucker, businesses begin to fail when their theory of the business no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Great storytellers help us to bring the various pieces of a puzzle together,” says Crothers. Becoming aware of the different narratives around us is the first step to successful storytelling. As researchers, Crothers says, we should think about the business, the product, the customer, and our stakeholders as all having different narratives, each with different goals, problems, and opportunities. “There’s a big, messy conversation going on where we’re all trying to inject our own story. There’s this cacophony of voices trying to have a harmonious conversation together,” he explains. “I think great storytellers and great storytelling is being able to thread a lot of those together into a common narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Know your audience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crothers references a common issue we hear from our customers at Dovetail: researchers struggling to get recognition and buy-in for the results and insights they bring to a multidisciplinary team. “They fall flat, and often they’re falling flat because it comes up against this other belief system,” says Crothers. “It’s because those stories don’t fit the narrative that’s going on internally within the business. That’s why it’s important to use our investigative skills to find out what’s driving each person and ask questions of different people around the company. It starts with superficial stuff like, what are your objectives? So you start with a story about what that individual is trying to do,” says Crothers. But I think our job is to get the story behind the story. To find out on an individual level what really incentivizes people. What do people believe about themselves and the business?” He laughs and tells me he knows this might sound like a shrink session, but maintains its importance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Collaborate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a facilitator, Crothers advocates for getting all the necessary stakeholders in a room for a research briefing. Rather than business as usual, ask probing questions of your stakeholders. “Find out what they’re curious about, what they’re worried about, and what decisions they are trying to make, and find out where research can help,” he says. “Another big one is to ask what their hypothesis is, what they are speculating should happen or not happen. Then there’s the awkward question: ‘What if that doesn’t happen? What’s that going to change?’ And have a heart to heart with them. That’s how you can find out that they really are bought in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Present with context&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a reason nature documentaries aren’t filmed in zoos,” says Crothers. “We’ve got to show the natural context. Show the product being used in its natural habitat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crothers argues you shouldn’t only show tables with results or a user interface full of redlining. Communicating research insights with impact requires that you do it with appropriate context. Use dynamic ways to engage with your audience, like video snippets, storyboards, photos, journey maps, or visual metaphor. Anything to bring your insights to life, as if you’re David Attenborough showing your customer in their natural habitat, using your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use plain language&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stay away from business jargon,” says Crothers. “We need to learn to speak the language of business, but the language of business should not be business jargon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best people in business always talk straight. They stay away from hollowed-out concepts and throwaway three-letter acronyms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, says Crothers, it’s fine to talk about OKRs (objectives and key results), but don’t talk about them in the generic sense, as if you’re just trying to signal that you know what they know. Talk about specific objectives and specific results. Help them make connections between your audience’s world and the world of those you’ve just been researching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make the ordinary extraordinary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establish the message you are communicating to your audience, tie it to an extraordinary detail, and relate it to what your audience is looking to get out of the research. “Find a detail in your research results that you and your audience might think is ordinary, but it’s extraordinary for the research participants,” says Crothers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take the humble team lunch,” says Crothers. “When the pandemic hit, and we were all working from home, we couldn’t get together like we did before. Once restrictions eased and we could come together for a team lunch, everyone was excited because they hadn’t done it in so long. That’s an example of an ordinary scenario, turned extraordinary. Understand how people use tools and services in these situations, and you can tap into something very powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use templates to draw out the threads of a story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we recap the various elements of storytelling—understanding internal stories, understanding how to tell stories around our research, how to convey insights in a compelling way—Crothers interrupts me. “I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that it can all seem quite fluffy to some people—too bad. That’s what storytelling is. From a more technical perspective, though, there’s a lot to be said for the good old humble user story and job story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m also a fan of using problem stories. These statements encapsulate a lot of different elements into an UberEats version of the story,” explains Crothers. “For example, as a persona, role, or archetype, they need to reach a goal. To do that, they need to perform a bunch of tasks, but there’s X problem that leads to Y impact,” explains Crothers. “I’m a big fan of those Mad Libs type of games. They give us a way to structure something so that it appeals to the head and the heart,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Telling stories in this structured way allows people to understand the impact on the people they are researching or the impact on the business. They enable us to show the impact on our colleagues. Once that impact is established, it inspires action, like a good story should. It can engage not only the head and the heart but also the hands because it’s practical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ben Crothers, Principle Facilitator, Bright Pilots. &lt;/b&gt;Ben Crothers has been involved in design since before Netscape ruled the world wide web, and in strategy and facilitation for the last 15 years.

However, in many organizations, it’s taken time for cross-functional partners and executives to understand the crucial role that user research plays in creating outstanding experiences that customers love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing right by your users is not only ethical but has an enormous impact on a businesses’ bottom line: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Six+Steps+For+Justifying+Better+UX/-/E-RES117708&quot;&gt;Forrester&lt;/a&gt; determined that superior user experiences increase visit-to-lead conversions up to 400 percent; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O94kYyzqvTc&quot;&gt;Dr. Susan Weinschenk&lt;/a&gt; reports that the average cost of fixing an error post-development is 100 times more than compared to beforehand; and overall, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2015/11/19/good-ux-is-good-business-how-to-reap-its-benefits/#23060ef64e51&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; cited that every dollar invested in UX returns $100 on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scores of user researchers find themselves in the enviable position of their services being &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; desired. The result? An inability to keep up with daily demands. In a perfect world, unlimited resources would enable UX research teams to scale indefinitely. In reality, budgets mean we must do the best with what we’re given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constraints keep our work engaging. Thinking through how to overcome obstacles sharpens our problem-solving prowess. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to this common scenario of having too much to do in too little time, a new concept has emerged in user research: the democratization of our responsibilities. In other words, educating and empowering your colleagues to orchestrate user research activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clear benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider these positives when evaluating whether to democratize user research at your organization and pitching it to stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Productivity at greater scale.&lt;/b&gt; Additional people supporting user research planning, execution, and analysis means higher output. As a bonus, the extra time freed up will enable you to focus on higher-impact projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduced friction and increased influence.&lt;/b&gt; As colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-fast-reliable-collaborative-analysis/&quot;&gt;gain more exposure&lt;/a&gt; to user research, they tend to build empathy towards its practitioners. Their firsthand experiences can transform them into allies for research at your organization. You might notice greater cross-functional harmony &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-influence-leaders-and-communicate-the-value-of-research/&quot;&gt;while campaigning for buy-in for research&lt;/a&gt; activities and find that garnering support for your recommendations becomes easier. More people performing and discussing research will also increase user research’s influence within your organization, opening new doors and granting opportunities to conduct research along with increased resourcing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better user experiences.&lt;/b&gt; More members of your team collectively focusing on your users will result in a clearer understanding of their needs, a stronger emphasis on human-centric designs, and better overall product experiences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Starting small&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel ready to create a program for training non-researchers to conduct research (we’ll get to that soon) or prefer to take baby steps, here are smaller initiatives to consider: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Host lunch and learns. &lt;/b&gt;Schedule time for your research team and cross-functional partners to break (virtual) bread while learning more about user research. Perhaps highlight approachable yet valuable topics like &lt;i&gt;User Research vs. Market Research, Favorite Research Methods, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Analyzing Research Findings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hold office hours. &lt;/b&gt;Set aside regular days and time where user researchers are available on a first-come-first-serve basis to answer questions about user research and provide light consultation for projects &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlight research findings. &lt;/b&gt;Amplify your user research work’s visibility and impact with regular share-outs such as an email newsletter or a dedicated Slack channel. Also, use repository tools like to increase the visibility of research insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steps to scaling &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re ready to get serious about scaling user research at your organization. Where does one even begin? A great way to start is to learn from those who have already done it—drawing inspiration from the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixed-methods.org/episodes/2017/6/15/research-bento-scaling-through-collaboration-donna-driscoll-kassie-chaney-linkedin&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/t6wwkJXh_Ic&quot;&gt;Nerdwallet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/BmJ2IfTHMag&quot;&gt;Fidelity&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, keep in mind that each company’s needs are different—here’s a framework you can tailor to your context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 0: &lt;/b&gt;Validate the need for a user research training program for non-researchers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of UXers would we be if we didn’t validate the need first? Before delving into creating a democratized user research program, consider: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a steady enough stream of work to sustain the need to scale, or is this just a busy period in the product life cycle? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How well does the nature of our research lend itself to being conducted by non-researchers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we currently have the time and resources to build out this program? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1: &lt;/b&gt;Identify the right individuals to participate in the program &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After validating the need for democratizing research with your teammates and leadership, begin thinking about cross-functional colleagues who are eager to learn more about user research and have the bandwidth to do so—don’t forget to receive their manager’s approval too. Historically strong participants include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product Designers. &lt;/b&gt;As natural allies of user researchers, designers already possess a human-centric mindset and understand the importance of integrating user needs into their work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product Managers.&lt;/b&gt; A great fit given their massive responsibilities for the timeline, feature set, and ownership of a product’s success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineers. &lt;/b&gt;Many never have the opportunity to interact with actual users despite being responsible for building the product, ideating creative technical solutions, and caring deeply about their work meeting people’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2: &lt;/b&gt;Delivering an engaging, practical, and educational experience &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve screened and selected willing participants, the fun begins. It’s time to equip them with the knowledge to conduct user research. A standard curriculum involves: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planning a study: &lt;/b&gt;defining objectives, crafting questions, and selecting methods &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Running a study:&lt;/b&gt; best practices on the dos and don’ts of moderating, strategies for taking effective notes, and what to expect during the sessions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyzing data:&lt;/b&gt; how to organize raw data, tag data based on frequency or severity, generate data-supported insights, and synthesize findings into recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing findings:&lt;/b&gt; format, expectations, and recommendations on presenting your research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3: &lt;/b&gt;Provide tools and templates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the foundational knowledge accounted for, you can move on to equipping participants with the artifacts and access they need to execute a research study successfully.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Templates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research plan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-running-unmoderated-tests/&quot;&gt;Interview, observation, or usability test guides&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation/&quot;&gt;Share out slide deck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Processes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/track-manage-research-participants/&quot;&gt;Recruiting, scheduling, incentivizing, and debriefing participants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reserving lab space for conducting in-person research or instructions on setting up remote research &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directions on where to store session data &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steps for accessing your research tool stack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4: &lt;/b&gt;Field experience &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no substitute for hands-on research experience with live users. It’s also crucial to identify the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; projects for non-researchers to tackle. Start them off with internal pilot sessions as practice, then identify projects that they can lead while reserving mission-critical projects for your dedicated user research team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early design exploration and exploratory interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design concept testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small-scale usability testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5: &lt;/b&gt;Reflect and iterate &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your newly minted researchers have completed their first research study, remember to debrief and revise your training program. Things probably won’t go perfectly the first time, but we can always learn and improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlight what was most and least useful in the curriculum.&lt;/b&gt;Trim unnecessary content and add in more of what people loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identify gaps in the program. &lt;/b&gt;Understand what elements your program participants wish were concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improve the artifacts provided.&lt;/b&gt; Besides sharing the materials from the training, think about creating playbooks and cheat sheets to aid knowledge retention. It’s also worth sharing resources for those who are eager to continue developing their skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks and concerns  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratizing research does not come without its potential downsides. Here are risks to be mindful of: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The devaluing of research.&lt;/b&gt; Detractors state researchers have worked too hard to get where we are today to relinquish our responsibilities to non-researchers. It indirectly creates a notion that “anyone can do research.” This reminds us to take extra care as we pitch user research democratization programs—we’re not training our replacements. Rather, we’re meeting the increased appetite for research by empowering more people to practice our craft on the right projects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decrease in research rigor. &lt;/b&gt;Another concern cited by those opposed to democratizing research is a rise in poorly executed, low-quality research from non-researchers. Though the research from your newly trained colleagues might not match those of a seasoned user researcher, they will still be trained to your standards. Mistakes can and will happen, yet non-researchers will be executing work on projects that might have otherwise been delayed or never even happened. That in itself can be a major win. At the end of the day, you and your team will still own major research activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating additional work for the user research team&lt;/b&gt;. Democratizing user research will likely yield increased productivity in the long run, however, crafting, executing, and tweaking a training program requires a sizable investment of time, energy, and resources. It might not &lt;i&gt;always &lt;/i&gt;be the wisest decision depending on your organization’s current needs (i.e., working towards urgent deadlines to deliver an MVP). Consult with your fellow researchers, colleagues, and leadership to ensure it is the right time to be building such a program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your turn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of UX Research is bright. The fact we’re even discussing having &lt;i&gt;too many research&lt;/i&gt; requests is exciting and cause for celebration. All indicators point to this trend continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing our field continue to flourish. In the meantime, we wish you all the best with your efforts to democratize and scale research in your org.

A book two years in the making, &lt;i&gt;Listen Like You Mean It &lt;/i&gt;draws on Vengoechea’s expertise as a researcher and manager in Silicon Valley. While it’s sure to help any aspiring or well-established research professional in the workplace, learning how to listen better, Vengoechea assures us, is a skill we could all benefit from—in the home, our relationships, and even with strangers. What we stand to gain, she says, is stronger, more meaningful relationships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tell us about the professional and personal experiences that led to the development of &lt;i&gt;Listen Like You Mean It&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a user researcher for nearly a decade and a writer for just about as long. I’ve always felt that if I learned something useful, it might be useful to others, too—that’s the motivation behind all of my writing, which is why so much of it centers on personal and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I realized how much my listening skills as a researcher had helped me in my personal and professional life, it was a no-brainer to share these lessons with others. Especially in this moment, where so many of us feel alienated and lonely, I really wanted to share what I could to help bridge some of those gaps and help us feel more understood, accepted, and valued in our own lives—and to offer the same empathy and understanding to others, too. So I wrote the book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/nahskd19&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listen Like You Mean It&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; which is based on my experience as a user researcher and looks at how we can become better listeners—at work, in our home lives, with friends, or even strangers—and build stronger relationships as a result. It takes the skills I learned in the UX lab and in the field and applies them to day-to-day, real-world scenarios. My hope is that readers walk away with the knowledge to improve their listening skills and the encouragement and inspiration to put them into action, so we can all feel a little more understood and connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The subtitle of your book is “reclaiming the lost art of true connection”—why do you think truly connecting with one another is being lost?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a confluence of events: We live in a time where so many of our interactions are digitally mediated from behind a screen, which makes truly connecting—at a human-to-human level—really hard. It’s easy to feel like we’re keeping in touch but also alienated from each other. Now, with the pandemic, we’re not only digitally apart but physically apart, too, which has really just exacerbated the problem. Even when we spend time together in person, there are so many other things—emails, to-do lists, our own emotions—that can easily get in the way of really hearing and connecting with other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can being a good listener make us better at creating and innovating? Is listening good for business?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a good listener is definitely good for business. When we are able to better hear others’ needs, we understand what is at stake in a project we are collaborating on or what will help our manager take the team to the next level. Listening is particularly impactful when it comes to creative ideation, brainstorming, and experimenting: it’s what allows us to invite all ideas into the room, to build on each other’s ideas, and to find the boundary-pushing ideas worth investing in. It’s hard to take risks and try something new if you are too afraid to listen to others’ ideas, thoughts, or opinions or if your own inner monologue is getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are a few quick and easy ways to improve the quality of our listening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the book, I talk about two kinds of listening: surface listening and empathetic listening. Surface listening is where most of us spend our time when we aren’t paying attention or listening with intention. We hear enough of a conversation to be polite, or we catch the literal words that have been said, but we miss out on gleaning deeper understanding. On the other hand, empathetic listening happens when we go beyond the literal to determine the meaning of what’s being said and the emotions your conversation partner is experiencing. The most important thing you can do to spend more time in empathetic listening mode is to come into conversations with what I call a listening mindset: empathy, humility, and curiosity. Combined, these qualities enable us to listen beyond the literal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who are some people you consider to have mastered the art of listening? What can we learn from them? How do they listen differently to others?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;User researchers! Researchers are so good at centering a conversation on their participant rather than themselves. They are practiced in staying present, asking open-ended questions, and bringing observation into their research sessions. They’re also very good at staying neutral and not taking things personally in a session. When you take these qualities outside of a UX lab and into the real world, they’re just as effective for enabling richer conversations. The challenge is that many of us researchers switch out of “research mode” when we leave the lab, and we forget these crucial lessons or are unsure of how to apply them to our day-to-day. My book serves as a guide on how to translate those skills from the lab to the real world and helps readers identify what hurdles might be getting in the way of their listening with empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What tips can you share about having difficult conversations? What do people often do wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common mistake made when having a difficult conversation is to dive right in without clueing others in on what’s about to happen. If you know you need to have a tough conversation, not only is it wise for you to prepare in advance, but it’s also wise to let the other person in on your plan. It’s the same as running a research session—you let the participant know how the conversation will go and what your intention in spending time together is. Why not give our friends, colleagues, and loved ones that same courtesy? Often a difficult topic can become much more approachable if we simply share why we are bringing it up in the first place. It’s also important to come into those conversations with an intention to understand rather than convince. There’s a huge difference! If I am trying to understand your political beliefs &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; convincing you to come over to my side of the political spectrum, that’s going to be a much productive conversation than if I come out swinging defending my position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Researchers are professional listeners, but they often tell us they struggle to be heard themselves—what advice would you give to a researcher looking to convey the value of research to stakeholders?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, you have to do good work—answer the right research question at the right time, demonstrate your understanding of the product—the basics. But most importantly, you have to know how to tell a good story. You have to know your audience, what insights or questions they are most interested in, what they might be skeptical about, even what constraints they might be facing within the organization, and then tailor your message accordingly. Think about your colleagues the way you might a research participant: what are their needs? Their motivations? Their perceptions? And how might your research findings fit into that? Once you know what someone’s needs, motivations, and perceptions are, it becomes much easier to tell a compelling story that will land with them. It’s what allows you to customize your pitch to a PM, so it’s more focused on impact, to an engineer, so it’s more focused on data, and to a designer, so it’s more focused on the user, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beyond professional development, what do we stand to gain from learning how to listen better?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much! Becoming a better listener helps us to deepen our friendships, strengthen our partnerships, know and understand our children, and learn a lot about ourselves, too. The best conversations are those where each party feels heard and understood. When that happens, we tend to open up more, to be vulnerable, to be honest, and to be ourselves. Feeling safe and secure enough in conversation for others to be themselves—and for you to be yourself—is one of the greatest gifts of empathetic listening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to create a powerful research presentation]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I used to write research reports, which then essentially turned into weighty research presentations. My trick was to copy and paste the information from my report into slides. There was little design or consideration of the flow of my research presentations. Instead, my audience would be facing walls of text while I spoke about the critical information that I couldn’t squeeze into the ever-so-small slides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was about four years into my career when I hit a breakthrough with this. I had always been envious of people who could put together beautiful and concise presentations that seemed to flow out of them. I figured, since I was a researcher (with a background in academia), my presentations would have to be ugly and filled with information. However, for this meeting, I had to do a good job. I was presenting research to executives and was hoping for a promotion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went through my slides and got to the halfway point when one of the audience members put their hand up. I froze, and my internal dialogue consisted of a cornucopia of swear words and considerations of running out of the room. It was as bad as I thought. The person said they were lost—agreeing nods circled the room—and asked me to “fix-up” the presentation. We would reschedule the meeting for when the slides were more concise and easier to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a week to change the way I reported and presented user research. In that week, I overhauled my entire structure and flow into a three-step approach I still follow today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before creating the presentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating the presentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During and after the presentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each step has its preparation that leads to a more thoughtful and deliberate presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Before creating the presentation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I no longer start with creating a presentation as my first step. I found that starting with the design and creation of slides was detrimental. Instead, I focused on beginning with ideas that could help me better create the presentation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Know your audience. &lt;/b&gt;Always consider your audience beforehand and the level of information your audience needs (or likely wants). Executive levels don’t want the nitty-gritty details of the study. Instead, they are interested in the overall themes you found and, most importantly, what the implications are for these findings. If you do what I did and present all the research details, you may see eyes glazing over. However, the team directly impacted by the study will want to know more detailed information. One tip: create the same presentation for everyone, but skip specific slides you know won’t be relevant to particular audiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outline the key insights. &lt;/b&gt;Before designing your slides, you should feel comfortable with the research and how it all fits together. I determine the critical insights by the information that came up the most frequently from users—usually focused on pain points. I only let myself choose up to five key insights to report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think about your teams. &lt;/b&gt;Ask yourself: “what is the most important information my team needs to know to make immediate decisions?” The answer to this question will likely mean you have to leave some information out of your report. That’s okay! You can always resurface those findings later when the timing is better, and the team can work on them. Instead, think about what your team needs to know &lt;i&gt;now &lt;/i&gt;to make better decisions on their current work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep it short. &lt;/b&gt;As mentioned, only consider up to five key insights! If you have many more than that, you might need to break down the presentations into different phases. When you present too much information at once, you lose your audience. I like to have my presentations be around 30-45 minutes, with 15 minutes after for questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;State your expected outcomes. &lt;/b&gt;If you feel comfortable, you can email your expected outcomes to your audience beforehand. For example, I would email the contents/plan of what I want to cover during the presentation and ask if I am missing anything. Doing this before helps to align your presentation with the audience’s expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get started on the actual presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating the presentation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was missing flow and had an overabundance of information. By prepping with the model above, I was able to cut down on the amount of data. However, I still struggled quite a lot because I like to write things, not show them, but that was an area I was losing my audience. With the feedback I received, I redid the structure of my report. This flow and design are what I use now in almost all of my reports:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First portion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agenda/contents. &lt;/b&gt;This section includes what you will cover during the presentation. By making it clear upfront, your audience will understand what to expect and be better able to follow the presentation flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected outcomes (reiterated). &lt;/b&gt;Hopefully, you were able to share these beforehand. Regardless, I like to repeat or share my expected results of the presentation. For example, at the end of the presentation, the teams can make X or Y decisions by the end or understand A and B implications and what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the study. &lt;/b&gt;These slides give context to the background of the project, methodology, recruitment, and approach you took to the study. It grounds the audience in understanding why the study happened as it did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Executive summary (three to five significant insights). &lt;/b&gt;Arguably one of the most important slides of the presentation. Remember the three or five insights you outlined above? Those insights should go into this slide with a brief overview, and they will be the driving force for the rest of the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Second portion (repeat with each insight)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insight one recap. &lt;/b&gt;This slide gives a summary of the first major insight you will tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Findings within the insight. &lt;/b&gt;Usually, findings make up insights. These findings are supporting evidence to the overarching insight. I include up to three findings that support each insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep dive into finding one, two, three. &lt;/b&gt;Each deep-dive is a different slide where you explain the finding and include media such as quotes, videos, or photos. It is super key to have this type of evidence (especially videos) because that is how people connect with users outside of research sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opportunity area for each finding. &lt;/b&gt;For each finding, you can highlight an opportunity area. For this, you can include a recommendation or a How Might We statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Third portion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recap of the insights. &lt;/b&gt;After going through all the insights and findings, give a general synopsis of your audience’s insights. This slide can mirror the executive study slide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overview of the opportunity areas. &lt;/b&gt;If you have too many opportunity areas, you can pick the top three to five opportunity areas the teams should focus on in the next quarter or half-year. Think back to the essential information for your teams, and use it to pick the opportunity areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impact/implications. &lt;/b&gt;In this slide, write down the implications or impact the research may have. For example, you might have to write that the team is focused on the wrong area or pain point and needs to pivot or that a new innovative product/feature might be a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recommendations. &lt;/b&gt;If you have pointed recommendations based on pain points, this is the slide to include them! I report on recommendations in a table that consists of the finding, the recommendation based on the finding, and evidence supporting this. For example, I find people cannot fill out a form, so I include that finding, my recommendation, and proof (quote, video, photo).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Links to all raw data. &lt;/b&gt;For those who want to dive deeper, include all the other information, such as notes, research summaries, recordings, and any other raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final tip: try to stay away from fractions when explaining how many participants encountered a particular problem or stated an insight. It is a lot more powerful to say 80% of participants felt X or struggled with Y than it is to say 4/7 participants. You disclose the number of participants at the beginning of the presentation, so there is no need to continue bringing that up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After putting in this information, I will start playing around with colors, fonts, alignments, and other design elements—first, the content, then the tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;During and after the presentation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask questions, engage people. &lt;/b&gt;I always stop at each section to see if there are any questions. You can also use polls or software (such as Mentimeter) to ask questions and engage with your audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Request feedback. &lt;/b&gt;After each presentation, ask your audience for feedback on what went well and what you could do better. With this information, you can continuously develop and hone your presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since implementing this process, I have had a lot more engagement and success with my presentations. People pay attention, have an easier time following the information, and then feel more compelled to take action. Having others get excited by, understand, and act on research is such a fulfilling feeling and one of the top outcomes we strive for. Try out this process and see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to influence leaders and communicate the value of research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-influence-leaders-and-communicate-the-value-of-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-influence-leaders-and-communicate-the-value-of-research</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Life as a researcher is frustrating. You understand the customer, and you care about solving problems, but buy-in from stakeholders and leadership is often difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture this. You’re conducting a round of usability testing. Your team thinks it’s straightforward, though in reality, it isn’t. Your stakeholders want the results &lt;i&gt;yesterday&lt;/i&gt;. But you can’t help but notice a similar user experience issue cropping up. It’s out of scope for this round of testing, so you decide to draw up a research plan to find out whether that niggling feeling in the back of your head is a real insight or just caffeine-related stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You raise the issue in your next meeting. A familiar glazed-eyed look fills the room. Somebody coughs. Everybody moves on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most researchers have experienced a similar scenario at some point in their career. Conveying the value of research to non-researchers, particularly the ones who control the purse strings, is often like banging your head against a brick wall (except at least a brick wall doesn&amp;#39;t question whether UX is even a real thing). To get your message across, like with so many other things in life, communication is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Now you’re speaking my language&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get buy-in from senior leadership types, you have to think like one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain an understanding of our mercurial leaders’ inner-most thoughts, we spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/contributors/brian-swift/&quot;&gt;Brian Swift&lt;/a&gt;, who’s worked in senior &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/interview-atlassian-sherif-mansour/&quot;&gt;product management&lt;/a&gt; roles at some of the world’s leading technology companies. Currently, we’re lucky to have him here as Head of Product at Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The primary thing I’ve experienced is that they aren’t always speaking the same language. Leadership doesn’t have full empathy for what research is doing,” Brian begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cites a communication issue we hear about a lot: Researchers tend to frame their proposals in terms of delivering a better user experience to the customer, but executives tend to think of things on a time and resource investment level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research wants time and budget to run a study. The promise back is that the usability of the feature will be better, or we’ll have a deeper understanding of our customer,” says Brian. “And while everyone in leadership wants those things; they want to build a better product, they want to understand their customer better; the calculus in their head is determining what the opportunity cost of this research is relative to other priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way to make it work with the obstinate money managers who cut the cheques, according to Brian, is to understand how decisions are made in terms of risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risky business&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we understand the value of research, but to an executive’s ear, research for research’s sake isn’t a compelling argument. Instead, ask leaders what their problems are, what metrics they want to move, and show how research can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research addresses uncertainties. Uncertainty is risk, and part of being an executive is determining how much and what kind of risk you want to incur,” states Brian. “As a researcher, understand whether it’s product risk, market risk, competitive risk—whatever it is—understand what worries those people. Understand what their problems are and frame everything you do in service of one, all, or some subset of those problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian says that the best researchers he’s seen are the ones who know how to quantify uncertainty around a business area, address that uncertainty with a research proposal, and make it clear what the costs and benefits are of being uncertain versus being certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Usually that’s expressed in revenue or adoption, or whatever metric that particular person cares about. Being able to speak in that language gives us more confidence that what we’re working on is going to be a success,” says Brian. “That’s the currency of an executive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“I think this is a really interesting area for us to explore”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian says statements like the above are often misconstrued. He acknowledges there’s nothing wrong with pursuing research out of interest, &lt;i&gt;per se.&lt;/i&gt; But it’s always better to relate it directly to decision-making and ROI. While research can be fun for researchers, executives rarely share that enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If research appears disconnected from the business strategy, it won’t be easy to convince leadership of your recommendation. Clearly tie research to a product or company objective as part of the research’s thesis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would also avoid boiling the ocean,” says Brian. “Oftentimes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&quot;&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;/a&gt; applies: you can get 80 percent of the results needed with 20 percent of the research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify, Brian isn’t arguing that validity is unimportant. Or that thoroughness isn’t essential to a researcher’s job. He’s providing his insight into an executive’s decision-making mindset. Unsurprisingly, executives value efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oftentimes you get a signal pretty quick, and you can trust that the research isn’t going to give you a definitive answer, but it’s going to give you an indicative one that you feel pretty confident in,” says Brian. “It’s the same as design and product management. You can get lost in the analysis paralysis of trying to find the perfect answer. If you do too much of that in research or design, it can become too costly. The perceived ROI gets way off because you’re taking too much time for whatever marginal benefit is received for each incremental hour or day is spent on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dos and Don’ts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When communicating the value of research to senior stakeholders and executives, the following list is a helpful guide for what to do and what to avoid:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO &lt;/b&gt;use customer empathy as a driving way to tell your story. &lt;b&gt;DON’T &lt;/b&gt;make it about your personal preferences. Make it about the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO &lt;/b&gt;express your methodology clearly and concisely, so it doesn’t feel like you’ve taken a biased approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO &lt;/b&gt;poke fun at the product’s faults. “When someone does research, and they poke fun at the product a little, I actually like that. It makes the problem feel more tangible and can be humorous, even though it’s painful. It can lighten up the room and encourage people to solve the issue,” says Brian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt; bring it back to the people you’re talking to and their thinking, and always express your ideas in natural human language. &lt;b&gt;DON’T&lt;/b&gt; get lost in research jargon or the way in which your team discusses concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO&lt;/b&gt; use quantitative data as a guide if you have it. “If you have some quantitative analysis to provide that backs up your qualitative, I think it’s always good to have that expressed in a way that’s clear and easy to understand and adds in some additional validity to what the outcome of your research is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to present your findings with impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your research Spidey-sense has gone off, and you’ve been given the go-ahead to pursue your hunch in the form of a new research project. Leadership is on board. Stakeholders eagerly await the fruits of your labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve wrapped up the hours of interviews, the even longer process of analysis (unless you use Dovetail, of course, &lt;i&gt;wink wink&lt;/i&gt;), now it’s time to put a bow on it and present your findings to the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You work your &lt;i&gt;tuchus&lt;/i&gt; off and produce a 12-page PDF...that nobody will ever read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No more boring PDFs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why go to all the effort of being the research rockstar that you are if your awesome reports immediately become shelf-ware. The only thing gathering dust should be the awards you win for presenting research, which is a thing that doesn’t exist yet, but totally will once we learn to present with &lt;i&gt;impact&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian says to get the attention of leadership, old formats need to make way for more dynamic emerging communication methods. As for PDFs, the issue, says Brian, is that there’s “a lot of text and people don’t have that much time, they can’t always sit down and read something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though more visually appealing and generally more captivating than a PDF, slideshow presentations still require people to give you an hour of their day. They also rely on the presenter’s ability to hold the room’s attention—a difficult thing to do for those of us who aren’t gifted orators. So unless you’re Harper Lee and you can write best-selling PDFs, or you’re gifted with the charisma of Barack Obama, it could be a good idea to think of new ways to say, “Hey, here’s some research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, these days we are conditioned to consume information visually. “Little video snippets are always best. They tend to help people digest small points and have it sink in.” says Brian. “I think a much better way to understand something is to hear your customers say it or to see someone interacting with your product and struggling to figure it out. Or even if it’s written, make it quick little one-liners and quotes of people constantly saying the same thing over and over again. It helps your audience realize that there’s a real problem—and it’s more compelling storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, learning about your customers shouldn’t happen once a week for an hour when everyone gets in a room,” says Brian. “How many times have you listened to a colleague make an interesting point during a slideshow presentation, and when you want to learn more, the next slide doesn’t cover it. If you could learn more about a topic simply by clicking on it, and all of a sudden, it’s like bingeing something on YouTube—that’s the goal. You can go deep on a topic and get consumed and soak up information quickly without having to find another document on some shared drive and confirm it’s the most up-to-date version. You want something that’s always live and connected, where you can easily traverse the information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keep the momentum going&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it. Getting buy-in from senior stakeholders and executives is more than just speaking the right language and having the right tools. It’s about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/creating-a-research-culture/&quot;&gt;building a culture around research&lt;/a&gt;; giving your organization confidence that customer knowledge will lead to better products and more growth. This takes time and effort. And it takes internal organizational change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important that research doesn’t feel like a thing you go to and purchase, and then you get something back. You never think that way of engineering, right?” asks Brian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You constantly need to be investing in research. It’s a muscle that the organization needs to exercise,” he continues. “We’re talking about getting the initial buy-in, but after that, you need to very quickly show that research is not a cost center—to use the financial term for an executive. It’s an investment in the product and the company’s growth,” explains Brian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then the conversations get beyond ‘does research matter?’ to a debate around the actual outcome and methodology of research. Then you’re talking about the decisions, and the assumption is that research will be there, and decisions cannot be made without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the journey that you need to go on. Everything we’ve talked about is how you build up to that.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learn a fast, reliable, and collaborative analysis approach]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-fast-reliable-collaborative-analysis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-fast-reliable-collaborative-analysis</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the sheer volume of interest that product, technical, and commercial teams have in understanding the merchant experience, much of the research conducted at Adyen is done by non-researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following article, I’ll share how our Research Insights team works with non-researchers to conduct customer research analysis. I&amp;#39;ll shed some light on what I’ve learned along the way, with a particular focus on making it as accessible, efficient, and impactful as possible for non-researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick note before we get started: Dovetail has played a big part in making &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/collaborative-research-ops/&quot;&gt;research analysis accessible to non-researchers&lt;/a&gt;; it’s now firmly nestled within our process. For that reason, you could find some of the terminology a &lt;i&gt;bit&lt;/i&gt; Dovetail-specific, but not to worry—the underlying principles can be applied to analysis using any tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two Brains &amp;gt; One&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing a complex web of user experiences, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/collaborative-analysis-research-stakeholders/&quot;&gt;two brains are generally better than one&lt;/a&gt;. On the most impactful research projects, I always bring along a range of key stakeholders for the research scoping, planning, execution, and analysis phases. At least one of those stakeholders also ends up becoming my co-analyzer-in-crime to dive deep into the data we gathered. UX writers, designers, product managers, and other researchers have all stepped up to be analysis sidekicks. Generally, as long as the person has a curious and analytical mindset, they make a great analysis sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The benefits of collaborative analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis goes faster:&lt;/b&gt; splitting analysis with someone else means &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-stakeholder-participation-can-make-ux-research-more-agile/&quot;&gt;finishing twice as fast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deeper interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: another person to bounce your perspective off of helps build a more multifaceted understanding of the participants’ experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More accurate analysis leads to stronger evidence: &lt;/b&gt;You gain more confidence about applying insights to important business decisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The costs of collaborative analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coordination check-ins are needed &lt;/b&gt;to reduce interpretation error, and these do take time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create a laundry list of tags&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the research notes or transcripts are clean and ready to be analyzed, we resist the urge to immediately dive into coding by first stopping to list out all the possible codes or tags that emerged in the research. This prevents us from ending up with an abundance of tags that might not be relevant, or even worse, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-we-learned-creating-tagging-taxonomy/&quot;&gt;might have unaligned taxonomy levels&lt;/a&gt;. After having coded all the data, the last thing we want is to have to code it all again! Here’s how we do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review the original research question script for inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With my analysis sidekick, we note down words that capture various answers to each research question. These are the categories that become our tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We copy our words and paste them into the “tags” section of Dovetail and categorize them into groups (if there are more than 20 unique tags).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Capture extraneous tag topics beyond the script&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review your interview notes (yours and anyone else&amp;#39;s) and any debrief notes and write down any other tag ideas you may have missed from reviewing the questions alone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Select broad enough taxonomy levels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the optimal nuance level of a code or tag can be a tricky process. If tags are too broad, then important data and nuance can be missed, resulting in having to create new, more detailed tags and re-tag all the data. If tags are too narrow, we can end up with too many tags (in my experience, more than 50 tags can become unmanageable), and you end up having to spend time combining tags to create broader tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exercise that can help is to think of all possible answers to the research questions and create categories that would accommodate many different answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say one of our research questions was to better understand a day in the life of a tech worker. Tech workers would have likely mentioned many different components of their days, such as, “I have a meeting, I get coffee with colleagues, I grab a colleague that’s passing by in the hallway to get their feedback.” Rather than tagging every single component that tech workers mentioned as individual tags (in this case, “meetings”, “coffees”, and “drive-by conversations,” respectively), we could tag them all into the common broader thematic topic of “interactions with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit to this broader tag approach is that the nuance of the &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; of interaction is still captured and can be found by clicking into the tag, but the overarching commonality of interactions &lt;i&gt;with colleagues&lt;/i&gt; is not lost. I have found this harmony between retaining nuance but not getting lost in it to be the most efficient way to capture topics accurately and maintain their integrity while still being able to easily compare them with other topics and segmentation criteria later on in the synthesis phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this list of tags, we are ready to start tagging the transcript notes with the confidence that the vast majority of tagging can be completed in just one go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synchronize tag interpretation with your analysis sidekick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involving another person in the analysis process can create room for error. Tagging similar data in different ways leads to inaccurate highlight categorization and ultimately makes it difficult to compare these highlights in the synthesis phase. To resolve this, once the laundry list of tags has been created, the researcher and their analysis sidekick need to synchronize on exactly what type of data each tag should cover. Luckily, there’s a shortcut to doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each analyst selects one transcript note to tag completely using the laundry list of tags created. Selecting two transcript notes that are very different from each other has the added benefit of covering a wider variety of tags to coordinate on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we swap notes and review each others’ tags. This is where we check to see if we would have tagged anything differently than our sidekick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a discrepancy in how we would have tagged a highlight differently, we note the difference in a comment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve finished reading through each others’ tags, we discuss any discrepancies and come to an agreement on what topics each tag includes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there was disagreement on multiple tags, then we try the process again with two other transcript notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once there is agreement on tag interpretation, we decide how to split the remaining transcript notes. I like to continue tagging them while on a live video conferencing call with my sidekick. If new tags come up, we add them to our tag list and alert each other so we can go back and re-tag previous notes with the new tags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can help to coordinate on whether to tag thoughts individually or as part of a paragraph. I prefer tagging each thought or sentence individually as each highlight is separated more granularly in the highlights tab during analysis, meaning I don’t need to click into the tag to read the whole highlight. Others prefer to highlight entire paragraphs as it speeds up the tagging process. Both approaches work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some handy tags to remember from project to project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “great quotes” tag is handy for dumping all compelling user quotes for easy access when creating videos and presentations for insight sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broad challenges and likes tags reoccur in every project since research interviews consistently include things the participants like and especially dislike. They are handy to combine with other tags when filtering in the analysis stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;During synthesis, include subject matter experts early and often&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical topics sometimes require interpretation from technical experts in the field. For example, when research participants referred to specific configurations in our platform, I needed to include our platform product manager to help explain and contextualize what the participants were referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reel in subject matter experts during the tagging process directly into participant quotes in the transcript notes by @tagging them in comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If possible, the subject matter expert can reply to my question directly in the comments, or I can expect an incoming call with an explanation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tag smarter by combining tag views in the filter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtering in the “Highlights” synthesis section of Dovetail allows for combining tags in numerous ways for a more granular perspective. This means that tags don’t need to be super detailed because they can be combined with other tags via a filter. This is why I tend to err on the side of capturing highlights into broader tags (as discussed above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the highlights view, to discover all update-related challenges, I create filters for “tag has all of dislikes/challenges + staying updated”. This saves me from needing to create a separate tag for “updating challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Experiment with insight creation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the tags using filters, I like to do two read-throughs of the highlights before creating an “insight” from the perceived patterns. I’ve witnessed two approaches to the insights creation phase:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Approach 1&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first read-through, I note down any patterns or themes that come up in the highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns end up eventually becoming insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I do a second read-through and select the relevant highlights that fell into the patterns I noted down. From the selected highlights, I create an “insight” and add the selected highlights to it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Approach 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other analysis sidekicks have preferred to use the Highlights table and add all the highlights in the filtered view to a yet unnamed new insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reading through all the highlights within the insight, they delete the highlights that don’t fit into any pattern or theme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they title the insight depending on what theme they discovered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infuse insight creation with another perspective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, the entire tag analysis and synthesis phase could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/a-stakeholders-perspective-on-engaging-in-research/&quot;&gt;a live collaborative process&lt;/a&gt; with the analysis sidekick. However, other scheduled meetings often make this a pipe dream. An alternative approach is to have daily “stand-ups” with the analysis sidekick at the end of each day to enhance or disqualify each insight with another perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the insights creation phase, we divide the tags in half and choose which ones we want to analyze (keeping in mind the most relevant tag combinations to analyze in tandem).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the coming days, as we analyze our respective sets of tags, we create insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We meet at the end of each day for ten to 30 minutes to share the insights we created with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to add more depth or contest the insights created with additional evidence from a whole other set of tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This divide and conquer approach allows us to cut down tag analysis time and infuses an alternative perspective and depth to each insight created. All this gets us closer to preventing bias from seeping into our insights, giving way for more confident decision making, eventually translating into more confidence in qualitative research as a practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration builds empathy for research &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening up the research process to our non-researcher stakeholders allows them to contribute meaningfully and speeds up an often long and opaque process. But perhaps one of the biggest lessons learned by immersing stakeholders in the messy data synthesis process is that it exposes the complexity that shrouds human behavior and gives new depth to their empathy for the merchants we serve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve often found this empathy also extends to researchers and fosters new appreciation for our practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[These are the business metrics every user researcher should know]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-metrics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-metrics</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember one meeting. I was with a few product managers, sitting around an open table. We had been laughing, joking, and talking about the company’s upcoming Halloween party. As soon as the meeting started, all of the fun stopped. In this meeting, I planned to convince (beg, really) my colleagues to incorporate user research into their process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My slideshow was ready to go, and I ran through my rehearsed pitch. I talked about the value of understanding customers and why user-centricity is so essential to an organization. If we understand our customers, we know what to fix, what to build, and how to build it.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I couldn’t have stressed this enough. I ended with a big smile and heard nothing but crickets. Someone cleared their throat, and I closed my eyes to take a deep breath.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same question rang out: “We understand that talking to users is essential, but &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; will it help us. It is great to understand better what to develop, but we can do that in a few different ways. How&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;will user research help us?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that meeting, I realized it isn’t about begging, convincing, or talking about how awesome user research is. Admittedly it took me a few years, but I learned it is about showing the impact user research can have on colleagues and the organization. Yes, user research leads to more user-centricity and empathy, but how can it help stakeholders achieve their goals? How can user research positively impact the organization’s goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to measure and demonstrate how user research is successful and the return on investment (ROI) user research can bring to an organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ways to measure the impact of user research across your team and organization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we need to speak the language of our colleagues. When we talk about abstract ideas, such as empathy or user-centricity, we can cause our audience’s eyes to glaze over. The most impactful words you can say directly relate to your colleagues’ goals. To speak to their goals, you have first to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product managers sit in between tech and business, and many of their goals include improving the business through increased revenue and decreased bugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is an overlap between what product managers want and what we want; we just think about it slightly differently. Product managers want users to sign-up, make their way through a product, and come back to generate revenue. User researchers want users to sign-up, make their way through a product, and come back because they are satisfied with the experience. When you dig into the similarities, you can see the potential to speak with your colleagues through overlapping goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I genuinely believe we can properly align and collaborate when we speak to each other’s goals. As soon as I realized this overlap, I started to think more like a product manager. Instead of begging people to do user research, I spoke about which metrics user research could positively impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Business metrics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product managers have a strong pulse on business metrics, and, as researchers, it is essential that we do as well. When I start working with teams, I ask them the crucial metrics they track, and I get to work understanding how user research could positively impact those metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent role, I worked very closely with the acquisition and retention team. During the initial meetings with product managers, I asked for a list of important metrics and on which pages/screens they were tracking those metrics. They listed off conversion rate, click-thru rate, session length, download rate, and others. I took those metrics and created research questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conversion rate research question&lt;/b&gt;: Determine the usability of a check-out flow &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click-thru rate research question&lt;/b&gt;: Understand how successful people are in signing up for a newsletter or Understand how successful people are in clicking through a flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Session length research question&lt;/b&gt;: Assess the quality of information on a particular page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download rate research question:&lt;/b&gt; Identify the value a product brings to users  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From then, I pitched the importance of user research from a business &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; user standpoint, which got a lot more interest and attention from colleagues. I went from, “We have to do usability testing to see if users understand the flow” to “Let’s do usability testing to assess the flow and uncover any problems that might impact conversion or click-thru rate.” My meetings quickly became much more efficient and effective once I spoke the same language as my colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I always include relevant metrics in my research plans (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/19_2S5c-LWhwEk86oMxemgwsYHcm6CG_rwut5TLz0byY/edit&quot;&gt;check out a template here&lt;/a&gt;). At the beginning of each project, we define the appropriate metrics to track, such as conversion rate. We then look into the current numbers, run the study, and make any changes based on the research results. After we make the changes, we monitor the metric to see any impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, you can tangibly measure the impact user research has had on a business level and prove the ROI of user research across an organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to measure the internal success of user research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success does not only mean looking outwardly but also at your user research practice’s internal mechanics. There are many great ways to track the impact of user research across an organization. By looking into these metrics, you can understand how effective your current user research practice is and spot improvement areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I set up a research practice, I make sure to track the following quarterly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of usability tests run. &lt;/b&gt;The number of usability tests run over a certain period can show increased user research maturity in an organization. This metric can also indicate if you are over-capacity or focus too much on usability instead of a balance of evaluative and generative work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amount of time to research. &lt;/b&gt;The amount of time from an idea to study is a great metric to track because it gives you an idea of how long it takes research to get started. Ideally, there is a short amount of time between an idea and research beginning. Tracking the time can point out areas you could streamline (e.g., creating email recruitment templates). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of research requests. &lt;/b&gt;I always use the number of research requests to help determine the user research maturity of an organization. If there are few requests, people may not know how and when to utilize research. Similar to usability tests, it can also show when you are over-capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of usability issues fixed. &lt;/b&gt;This is my favorite metric to track internally. Yes, it is excellent if we are running research, but how much gets actioned? This metric shows you the number of usability issues fixed in a given amount of time (e.g., three or six months) and can indicate that research is successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of generative sessions run.&lt;/b&gt; Like tracking usability tests, the number of generative research sessions run indicates a higher user research maturity since you are looking into a product or service’s holistic experience. When colleagues are interested in generative research, there is an appetite for real change and innovation. By combining this metric with usability testing, you can balance the number of generative and evaluative sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number of features from user research on the roadmap. &lt;/b&gt;This metric maps nicely with the number of generative research sessions run. If the product/tech team uses insights from research to create a roadmap, user research is influencing the company strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I can, I start measuring these metrics, both business and internal, to understand the longer-term impact user research has on an organization. With time, you can answer those tough questions about whether your work and insights improve the product and organization. Plus, you can forge wonderfully collaborative relationships with your teams and &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; the power of user research. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New normal: How UXR is shaping the post-COVID-19 future of telehealth]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/new-normal-how-uxr-is-shaping-the-post-covid-19-future-of-telehealth</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/new-normal-how-uxr-is-shaping-the-post-covid-19-future-of-telehealth</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic how many of you had considered calling your doctor up for a phone consultation when you were sick? If the numbers are anything to go by, not very many. 

Unsurprisingly, the health care sector was one of the most impacted areas of the COVID-19 global health crisis. Most notably, the use of telehealth—the exchange of medical information from one site to another through electronic communication to improve a patient’s health—exploded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic hit, people largely avoided telehealth services. &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.amwell.com/2019-consumer-survey-majority-of-consumers-are-willing-to-use-telehealth-but-use-varies-by-age/&quot;&gt;Amwell’s 2019 Consumer Survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that only eight percent of US consumers had engaged with telehealth before COVID-19. As a result of the pandemic, Forrester analysts projected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/telehealth-visits-could-top-1-billion-in-2020-amid-the-coronavirus-crisis.html&quot;&gt;more than one billion&lt;/a&gt; virtual healthcare interactions occurred by the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In times of rapid global transformation, there is greater uncertainty and risk around product development. In turn, there should be a greater emphasis on research to understand new user needs and to de-risk future product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research is vital to the next generation of digital health care solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help us understand how customer research is shaping the future of the telehealth industry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-vinh-1320017/&quot;&gt;James Vinh&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/s-d-x-d/&quot;&gt;SDXD&lt;/a&gt;, spoke with us about his experiences in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a lot of the consumer-facing tech apps and hardware that we work with, digital natives are the typical demographic,” he begins. “But in the research that I’ve done in telehealth, it’s usually an older aging population who might not be familiar with a touch interface or technology that has a lot of inputs and requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer empathy is an all-important cornerstone of UX research, but the concept takes on new meaning in the health care industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many patients I worked with were recovering from hip and knee surgery. So there’s that physical injury. And then also mentally and emotionally, there’s that loss of independence and that sense of looming uncertainty,” says Vinh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With something as simple as an empathy map, we can get insight into what patients are thinking and begin to understand their real concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinh walks us through the logistical challenges of translating in-person care into a remote digital experience. The affordances of having someone in the room to help a patient feel comfortable, walk through procedures, and assist with any troubleshooting—all need to translate to a patient-friendly, digital context. Communication and a sense of ease and support must be communicated virtually through text and digital formats. It takes seconds for another person in a physical context to solve something as simple as the location of a button on a keyboard. In a remote setting, in the absence of visuals, the task can be borderline impossible. Critically, it’s important to “make patients feel supported, welcome, and loved—even though there’s not that in-person connection,” says Vinh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19 changed the way practitioners view technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients aren’t the only end-users of telemedicine. Research efforts need also to consider health care practitioners’ needs in the development of new technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his field, says Vinh, there was an almost uneasy tension between human and machine before the pandemic. The notion that digital solutions will replace practitioner care as opposed to facilitate it was common. Since the novel coronavirus forced the world into remote interactions, however, there’s a growing appreciation that humans and machines can work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more practitioners adopt remote technology to care for their patients, another dimension of UX research becomes realized. “It’s not just the patients, but it’s also, of course, the physicians, the physician’s assistants, and the practitioners, who are experiencing this learning curve,” he says. “Both the patients and practitioners are learning together, getting used to the new norms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future of telehealth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality&quot;&gt;McKinsey&lt;/a&gt; report, health care providers in the United States have seen a 50 to 175 times growth in the number of patients using telehealth services compared with pre-COVID-19 days. Where before the total annual revenues of US telehealth players were an estimated US$3 billion, projections are now showing that up to US$250 billion of the current US health care spend could be virtualized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With unprecedented growth levels for the industry on the horizon, Vinh believes researchers will have to help product developers overcome many complex challenges. “I think the onboarding both from the patient and the provider side is going to continue being a challenge,” he says. “Because as far as I’ve seen, there are best practices, but there’s no uniform approach. We need mature design systems, and standards and practices for telehealth solutions and how we conduct research on them. There’s going to be a learning curve as people present prototypes and eventually build those out into systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinh cites the COVID-19 pandemic as presenting another type of unique challenge for researchers and product teams. Last year, as most of the world was forced indoors, each day brought new degrees of uncertainty. Recommendations and best practices often changed daily. Designing systems that can cope with a pace of change on the level we’ve seen in the past year will be incredibly difficult for product teams to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinh remains hopeful that the future of telehealth is bright. Ultimately, people will use these services to help get healthier more quickly and efficiently. “We’d love to see a decrease in costs because it’s not going to be so manual and labor-intensive,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then I’m hoping for an overall more pleasant patient-provider experience with improvements to a lot of the common things that we associate with healthcare, whether it’s long wait times or inadequate healthcare outcomes,” says Vinh. “People often say they’re not getting enough attention or personalized care. Hopefully, practitioners in conjunction with these tools can help fill that gap and make sure everyone’s getting healthier and feeling like they’re taken care of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by James Vinh, President, San Diego Experience Design Professionals.&lt;/b&gt;

Lucy outlined the importance and value of non-researchers engaging in research, as well as a few ways stakeholders should look to become more engaged in the research process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re following up on this sentiment but from a researcher’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanjarvis/?originalSubdomain=nz&quot;&gt;Brendan Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, Managing Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://thespaceinbetween.co.nz/&quot;&gt;The Space InBetween&lt;/a&gt;, “New Zealand’s only specialist UX Research practice and world-class UX lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he established The Space InBetween, one of Jarvis’s explicit intentions was to “help product and design leaders to change the culture of their organizations, open up the research process, and get to insights quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarvis not only has a vested interest to encourage more decision-makers to get involved in the research journey but a firm and earnest belief that it’s one of the most effective ways to drive real-world impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get your stakeholders in the room&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/growing-demand-ux-researchers-andrew-smith/&quot;&gt;Leaders want researchers to have more input&lt;/a&gt; into product decision-making. The issue isn&amp;#39;t a lack of appetite. There isn’t an executive on Earth who would say no to having a deeper understanding of their customers. It just comes down to the way research is conducted in so many organizations. Projects take place outside of the fast-paced cadence of sprint cycles, and often reports will be “thrown over the fence” far too late to have impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost like research is a separate unit within the business,” says Jarvis. “There’re a lot of structural issues to overcome for organizations to unlock the potential of research for their products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The UX lab isn’t going to solve all of that, but we can be a circuit breaker to illustrate the benefit of bringing different experts together at the same time and introducing more structure into the process,” he says. “Designers and engineers can see the researcher with the customer and have that immediacy of insight that comes from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a huge benefit in discussing together what they saw in the moment, rather than waiting two weeks until someone puts a PowerPoint deck in their inbox and goes, ‘Here are the results from the research.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips for engaging stakeholders in the research process &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;”Most stakeholders I’ve come across, fortunately, have been quite keen to be involved in the research process,” says Jarvis, ”and it’s essential that they are. Many a research report has died before it has even been presented because the right people weren’t along for the journey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure a successful effort in collaborating with stakeholders, Jarvis provides the following recommendations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make a point of having a conversation (i.e. interview) with important stakeholders.&lt;/b&gt; Treat it with the same respect you would a user interview. Stakeholders are people too, and people like to be heard. Having a little empathy for them enables you to see how they see things, what’s important to them, and gives you a better chance they’ll support your findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Invite stakeholders to attend research sessions and be clear about what you want them to do when they arrive.&lt;/b&gt; Stakeholders, especially senior ones, don’t have lots of time, and they don’t want to look like they don’t know what they should be doing. Be sure to have them participate in debriefs but be mindful of whether this might affect other people’s contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good food and drinks are helpful, especially when observing.&lt;/b&gt; Research is hungry work! If you’re able to, celebrate the end of your study and invite your stakeholders. It’s a good opportunity to speak with them in a less formal session and build a stronger relationship for when the next study comes around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The need for speed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before founding The Space InBetween, true to his roots as a researcher, Jarvis went out and interviewed senior UX practitioners, product people, and CX professionals to try and understand why researchers were struggling to have impact on product decisions. Time and again, he says, when UX isn’t part of the core product team, the problem is a lack of immediacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, engaging your team and stakeholders in research doesn’t only drive empathy and empower them to take action on customer problems. Collaboration means moving together at a faster pace, speeding up the research process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a time delay before you brief in the research; then it’s weeks later before you get the findings. Often that doesn’t fit with the expectations that the product manager or the designer or the engineers have placed upon them, in particular by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/agile&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt;,” explains Jarvis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By the time you get the research, you might be three sprints down the track. And it’s almost too little too late,” he says. “So a lot of people were frustrated by that. And I know researchers were frustrated because that means they get the brief, do the work, come back and present the findings, and it would get ignored half of the time because people have moved on. There’s frustration on both sides, and that’s part of what we’re trying to solve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The benefits of engaging stakeholders in research &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides forging stronger bonds between customers and product teams and motivating stakeholders to solve real customer problems, Jarvis outlines the benefits of collaborating on observational research with stakeholders:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to build empathy for your users, taking them out of the abstract (i.e. ‘the user‘, or analytics data) and into reality. You get to see the pain you’re unnecessarily inflicting on them as much as the great things you’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sparks conversations about what you can do to solve user problems that otherwise wouldn’t happen if everyone stayed in their own silos—either functional silo, or their own mini-silo within the team they’re working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should speed up decision-making and lead to less rejection of research findings, as people get to see firsthand how their users currently do things or what’s not working for them in your solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Admittedly, it isn’t that simple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of research on the concept of “exposure hours”; UX thought leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uie.com/&quot;&gt;Jared Spool of UIE&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.uie.com/user_exposure_hours/&quot;&gt;big advocate&lt;/a&gt; for the idea. Leisa Reichelt of Atlassian &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/creating-a-research-culture/&quot;&gt;implemented exposure hours&lt;/a&gt; for her teams and even implemented increased exposure to customers as one of their OKRs for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone has the benefit of working in an organization with those priorities. “People watching the sessions, attending interviews, actually spending time with the customers, it’s a hard ask because there’s a lot of time pressure, particularly in agile organizations,” acknowledges Jarvis. “Every hour you spend watching a customer using your product or being interviewed about your product is an hour you can’t spend either designing or developing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, research projects often take place outside of the pace of sprint cycles with good reason. Some research simply can’t be rushed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies/&quot;&gt;Longitudinal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/facebook-research/getting-started-with-foundational-ux-48dd244b763e&quot;&gt;foundational&lt;/a&gt; studies that deal with ongoing observations or big unknowns are some of the most worthwhile and high-impact work a researcher can do. Encouraging stakeholders to engage with or participate in research isn’t a cure-all but simply one tool in a kit of many to help rethink your research approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s certainly worth thinking about if you’re contemplating having more impact in your organization. “If you’re not spending that time with your customers, even if it’s indirectly through observation, then how are you really getting a true sense of what the experience is like for the people that you’re supposedly making the product for?” asks Jarvis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of organizations rely heavily on product analytics, hard data, and quantitative research. And there’s some security in that because numbers feel safer, but they’re not the full story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s something very valuable that you’re missing as a team if you’re not seeing and understanding how people are using your product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For relatively little cost compared to the potentially significant impact, exposing your stakeholders to the research process could be one of the most straightforward ideas you could implement as a researcher looking to grow a research-rich, customer-driven culture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A stakeholder’s perspective on engaging in research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/a-stakeholders-perspective-on-engaging-in-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/a-stakeholders-perspective-on-engaging-in-research</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here at Dovetail, we research researchers. One thing we hear all the time is that research professionals are always looking for ways to engage decision-makers in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not surprising, I found this insight interesting. As a decision-maker myself (product designer), I also want to engage more with research. So why is stakeholder engagement such a challenge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we have a deeper look at the problem, let’s clarify what we mean by “decision-makers.” Designers, product managers, engineers, and people in business development roles all use research as input to impact the direction and development of the product or business. It could be a shift in the company’s strategic focus or a change to a design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with reports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the beginning of the issue often lies in the nature of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my previous job, I would often receive a research report including findings from a broad study conducted by a researcher covering our area of the business. As just one of the designers working in this area, I found it hard to interpret actions I should take and make informed decisions on my particular part of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings felt abstracted away from the data that led to them. I was missing context. The report was also long and covered topics across our entire department. It was hard to decipher which insights were relevant to my work and retain the information going into the design process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My researcher was a fount of knowledge in our area of the business. I felt I could rely on her to answer all my questions throughout the design process. But she was in high demand. I was uncomfortable pestering her for details multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of UX research is to enable decision-makers to make informed decisions that will positively impact the product or business (or both). It’s a team effort, and we know the throw-over-the-fence reports don’t work for anybody. Since then, I have come to a few conclusions about how decision-makers and researchers can work together to achieve the best outcomes for the product and overall business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get involved in the research process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many stakeholders, their level of involvement in the research process is limited to providing a brief to the researcher, then coming back at the end for the research findings. Maybe they’ll collaborate on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-data-analysis-project/&quot;&gt;a research plan&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps add a couple of questions to a discussion guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, if you’re expected to make decisions from the research output, you need to be much more involved in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Attend all research sessions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a designer, I find it incredibly valuable to attend research sessions to hear customer stories first-hand. Researchers are sometimes hesitant to have designers and product managers attend one or two sessions for fear they’ll only remember what they’ve heard in those sessions and make poor decisions based on a small sample of data. It’s not an unfounded fear (it usually comes in the form of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)&quot;&gt;anchoring bias&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic&quot;&gt;availability bias&lt;/a&gt;). Even if you’re aware of the bias, it’s so easy to retain and add more weight to insights you’ve heard first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I prioritize attending all research sessions (or listening to a recording of the session). It helps me to build a holistic understanding of the customer and bring it into my design process. Regardless of whether you’re able to join the synthesis process or not, it’s much easier to interpret the final research insights when you have this background as context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Give feedback to your researcher&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a stakeholder, there’s a major problem with only involving yourself during the planning phase of research and then hightailing it until the project is finished. There’s no opportunity to provide feedback to the researcher to make sure you’re learning the right things to influence the decisions you need to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attending research sessions and understanding how participants answer questions can lead to new questions arising, different ways of asking questions, or finding you need to speak to entirely different audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes during the research process, you can uncover questions you didn’t know to ask at the beginning of your study. Rather than waiting until all the research is done, having a gap in your understanding, and then needing to perform another study, attending sessions gives decision-makers and researchers the opportunity to be agile in their learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Running research yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not always feasible for researchers to run all the research tasks in organizations. There’s usually more to learn than there are researchers available, and it makes sense for researchers to prioritize more strategic work as opposed to evaluative research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, there may come a time where you need to run research yourself (or at the very least, help your researcher run research). That’s not to say research isn’t a specialized craft. Researchers are experts, but they shouldn’t be gatekeepers to talking to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think of it like design and engineering. Engineers usually outnumber designers. In my previous role as a designer at Atlassian, we typically had a team of eight or so engineers to one designer. It’s not always feasible for designers to create designs for every UI change engineers implement. Designers create design systems to help engineers make small design decisions. Here at Dovetail, our engineers usually ask me to review their changes before the final design goes out. This is typically how designers scale design in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, your researcher may provide resources, training, best practices, templates, or in-person guidance to enable designers and product managers to execute on small research projects. For example, in previous roles, I was usually responsible for running usability testing of my own designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quick Tip for up-skilling in research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attending research sessions run by your researcher is a great way to learn how the pros do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Atlassian, I did “reverse shadowing” with a researcher. I would run the session, and she would observe. She could then give me feedback on my interviewing technique and felt more comfortable letting me run my own research further down the track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve also been participating in research studies by other companies to learn how researchers in other organizations conduct research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Involve researchers in your process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s much more efficient to include researchers in your decision-making process to ensure you and your team take the right action from the research output. Treat researchers as more than input into your process, but rather as a partner—just as you are a partner in their process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a designer’s perspective, often after research is done, we run a design sprint to ideate solutions to problems we’ve heard or iterate on existing experiences. I like to include researchers in these processes and design rituals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I always invite researchers to design critique sessions because they can give further input on how the design meets the user needs and can help suggest ways to make the experience more impactful for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also find researchers can have incredibly valuable input into roadmap planning discussions and product strategy discussions. Researchers can bring the customers’ needs to the table and help prioritize efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Researchers are more than resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, lots of what I’ve touched on in this article relates to enhancing cross-functionality between roles in product teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many organizations understand the benefits of cross-functionality and boast about the agility of their product teams. But it’s so often the case that a researcher is siloed off, conducting research on their own and tossing reports over the fence. This means good research can often be difficult for others on the team to use and ultimately means it becomes shelf-ware. I’ve known researchers who become frustrated that the organization isn’t listening, or they find the same insights over and over again. Still, they feel the organization doesn’t do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By opening up our processes to one another, both researchers and designers (and also product managers) stand to benefit a lot. And in the long-run, stakeholders participating and engaging with research more often and on a deeper level will undoubtedly lead to better product decisions and an overall more customer-centric culture in our organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail achieves SOC 2 standard for security, availability, and confidentiality]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-achieves-soc-2-security-availability-confidentiality</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-achieves-soc-2-security-availability-confidentiality</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We know that you entrust Dovetail with potentially sensitive and confidential research data about your customers.

For example, the maturity level of design tools, payment processing platforms, or web services is quite high compared with products that solve problems for the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail CEO and Co-founder Benjamin Humphrey points to increasing investment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://irishadvantage.com/high-investments-in-agritech-demonstrate-future-growth-and-impact-of-the-sector/&quot;&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.holoniq.com/notes/global-education-technology-market-to-reach-404b-by-2025/&quot;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/health-tech-investment-trends.html&quot;&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/us-fintech-market&quot;&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; technologies, as evidence that the uneven distribution of technology is coming to an end. He believes research will be the bridge that drives the expansion of sophisticated digital products and services into non-tech sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only just starting to see the growth in spaces like agriculture, education, finance and healthcare software in the past few years,” he says. “So your local doctor has been relegated to using rubbish software for the past 20 to 30 years, but now there are more and more startups in that area because they’ve run out of problems to solve for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research obviously played a part in developing products for Silicon Valley-based businesses, product teams had an advantage in that they were essentially creating products for themselves. They already possessed a high level of inherent customer understanding. The issue with addressing customer needs outside of the technology sector is that the customer base is far more diverse in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In new industries like agriculture technology, where you’re building products for farmers, it’s unlikely that software developers or a person who starts a software company is going to be a farmer,” says Benjamin. “So, engineers, designers, product managers, and founders need to go out and spend time in the field with farmers to figure out some hypothetical solution for milking cows more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And how do you do that? Well, you typically go and hire people who know how to speak to farmers—that’s what anthropologists and researchers do,” says Benjamin. “So, product teams are hiring researchers earlier and earlier, and I think that’s something that’s only going to get more prevalent as time passes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Insights will live under one roof&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is all about uncovering mysteries, says UXR Collective Co-founder Alec Levin. It’s finding the answer to difficult questions that also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/creating-a-research-culture/&quot;&gt;have high impact&lt;/a&gt;. These questions aren&amp;#39;t only  about customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, the product is part of the business, but there’re other things that we need to figure out and uncover mystery-wise that matter to the success of the business. And to do that, we need to change the way we work,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin’s big picture prediction is the rise of research departments—a department of truth, he calls it, while acknowledging that, yes, it does sound like something straight out of &lt;i&gt;Nineteen Eight-Four.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re saying there are things that are important to our success that we don&amp;#39;t know. That’s true for almost every single business,” urges Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argues that a central department of research would mean creating a leadership role that could “talk” to other department heads, coordinate research on a company-wide level, and report to the C-suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to have a research leader who doesn’t have to be the best at interviews or the best at any particular method,” he says. “Someone who knows a lot about methods and knows what they’re good for and how to work with them, but who also understands business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When somebody else is doing the project prioritization for us, we’re essentially saying that our point of view doesn’t matter,” Levin contends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s stupid. Instead, go and do some research within the company, figure out what the big problems are, and then say, ‘Here’s what I think I should be working on: solving these mysteries rather than doing usability tests or interviews.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Privacy regulation will become an even more significant factor in research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d say a big one this year will be more regulation and compliance,” says Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cites increased awareness of big-data algorithms and their problematic relationship with the spread of misinformation and increased political polarisation, or the misuse of data by companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; that led policymakers across the world to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/gdpr-design-researchers/&quot;&gt;evermore strict privacy and data protection laws&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a constraint that researchers are bound by because obviously research all about the details and specifically about demographics, personal information, and building a picture,” says Benjamin. “Researchers have to be able to paint a compelling picture with evidence to stakeholders, colleagues, and clients, but they have to do that in a way that’s privacy-conscious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, privacy has been more of an ethical problem for researchers, but now it’s a legal problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin refers to similar trends in financial sector regulation that have been ongoing since the 1970s. “I think Research Ops teams might start operating more and more like finance teams in publicly listed companies, where they have compliance and certification processes, and they have policies and software to help them enforce it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly heavy privacy regulations pose a difficult challenge for the industry. It’s very difficult to build empathy when you can’t show people’s faces or disclose anything about them, Benjamin reflects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More privacy regulation would also hinder efforts to democratize research. “You simultaneously want more people consuming and doing research, but then you also have to be safe about how you do it from a privacy standpoint,” he observes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Solutions will probably be some part software, some part processes, and some part social conventions, policies, training, and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people say it’s an immovable constraint, but in a similar way to other heavily regulated industries, there will be opportunities for innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Predictions for user research in 2021: part one]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/predictions-user-research-2021-part-one</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/predictions-user-research-2021-part-one</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With 2020 finally over and 2021 already descending upon us like a herd of Black Friday shoppers looking for a PS5 deal, we thought it’d be a good time for us to take stock and reflect—and while we’re at it—crack out the crystal ball, don our best soothsaying cloak, and make some bold predictions about the future of customer research for the big year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help in this endeavor, we’ve recruited two of the best divination specialists out there—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleclevin/&quot;&gt;Alec Levin, CEO and Co-founder at UXR Collective&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto, and our very own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/humphreybc/&quot;&gt;CEO and Co-founder of Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, Benjamin Humphrey. Between the two of them, they have served us up a smorgasbord full of spicy hot takes, tastily prescient predictions, and refreshing well-trodden wisdom. And (as you can probably tell from the title) we had so much on the menu, we decided to release it in two servings, so keep your eyes peeled for the next course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, let’s draw the curtain and get the show started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;Today’s Specials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratization of research will be inevitable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasingly online world will drive the demand for research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video will continue to play a large part in conducting and consuming research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports will become more interactive and collaborative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Democratization of research will be inevitable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a recurring and somewhat controversial topic in the research community for a long while now. Still, Alec Levin is coming down hard on one side of the fence: Democratization of research is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says our current ways of working are not sustainable. If organizations can’t hire enough researchers to conduct research, it becomes important to involve stakeholders in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is common with the debate around democratization, there are many different approaches, opinions, and definitions of what it would look like on a practical level. “When we say the democratization of research, it elicits some strong feelings from people,” acknowledges the UXR Co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more precise word here would be the structurization of research. It’s about being intentional about where you require research expertise to learn something and where you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, it doesn’t make sense anymore for researchers to be doing usability tests. Because, honestly, that work is not too difficult. Other people can do it,” he says. “Compared with an in-depth ethnography, which is really hard—you need training to do that. That’s a good example of democratization. I think it’s an inevitability because there’s just too much we need to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows researchers to focus on stuff that’s important but not necessarily urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s hyper-connected world, competition moves fast, opines Levin. There is increasing customer demand for well-designed, user-friendly products and services. “It’s even more important than ever to stay on top of what’s going on,” he says. “You’re going to want your researchers focusing on higher level, big, strategic, sometimes multi-month projects, rather than just helping with the product team’s usability issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An increasingly online world will drive the demand for research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED505602.pdf&quot;&gt;In the 90s and early 2000s&lt;/a&gt;, your average internet user was likely to be young, male, educated, affluent, and urban and not a member of a racial or ethnic minority group. They were also almost certainly from a Western nation—shockingly, only seven percent of the world’s population were online in 2000 compared with 50 percent of the US population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a relatively short period, this has changed—dramatically. “We’re quickly approaching 100 percent of people being online,” says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the internet, building a product or service for other net users required you to understand a group who were more or less just like you. “Now, all of a sudden, instead of everybody having the same socioeconomic status, literally every socioeconomic status is represented,” says Levin. “Instead of everybody speaking the same language, having the same culture and the same values, now everyone has every single culture and value set represented.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the world has become more connected, our intuition has changed dramatically from something really useful for building products and services to something that would lead us astray.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to build something, what do you do? The answer is research. Research is the only way you can figure out what other people who aren’t like you are looking for, want, and need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Video will continue to play a large part in conducting and consuming research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three factors have spurred on the increased usage of video in research over the past few years, according to Benjamin Humphrey, CEO and Co-founder of Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech-to-text natural language processing and AI have reached a point that is both affordable and accurate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;allowing for high volume transcription tools like Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, dScout, and Otter to process large amounts of research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud storage and bandwidth have become cheap and accessible, allowing for a huge amount of video data to be recorded and stored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic means &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/collection-analysis-remote-research/&quot;&gt;researchers are conducting more remote video interviews&lt;/a&gt; than ever before, giving the format increased relevance and utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trend will continue, says Benjamin, as researchers come to rely on raw video footage broken up into small segments as a way of synthesizing findings and presenting them to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reports will become more interactive and collaborative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know the read rate is quite low for reports in their traditional form; they’re offline, disconnected from the data, they aren’t really searchable, and they’re not standardized,” states Dovetail’s founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next year or so, reports will evolve with richer source material, so it’s not just people’s notes. You’ll get higher engagement, and reports will become less long-form academic documents and more of an interactive thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know video is more engaging than text—by a large margin. The impact from listening to an end-user or customer in the first person, rather than reading potentially biased notes, is driving a trend towards mixed-media reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, PDFs aren’t interactive. “You can have a discussion about it in Slack, or you can put comments in there and have a discussion inside the PDF and almost secondarily analyze it or ask follow up questions of researchers and things like that,” says Benjamin. “But I think reports being cloud-based will enable more collaboration, with an increased feedback loop between the research and stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If research is getting more investment, headcount, and budget for software, says Benjamin, it comes with a requirement to demonstrate impact and ROI. Something that remains difficult to do with current reporting practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t really do analytics in a PDF. You don’t know how many people have seen it or what they read, or when they dropped off. Whereas with a video and reports that are cloud-based, you can do analytics, you can see how many people have looked at the page, how many have scrolled to the bottom, you can see when the drop-off is and after how many seconds it happened,” says Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For a second serving of hot takes on user research in 2021, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dvtl.link/clicktoparttwo&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;check out part two of the series here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Alec Levin, Co-founder, UXR Collective. &lt;/b&gt;Alec is one of the co-founders of UXR Collective, the creators of UXRConf.

If you’re interested in our journey to date, check out these articles from &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/reflecting-on-2018/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/looking-forward-to-2019/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/why-we-raised-4m-seed-2020/&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2020&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down here in Australia we started 2020 with months of bushfires and COVID-19 changed our day-to-day with remote work and lockdowns. However, despite the challenges of 2020, we grew our team, added hundreds of new customers, and as Australia got on top of the pandemic, returned to a semblance of normality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, we evolved Dovetail’s analysis with &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/research-stories-with-video-highlights/&quot;&gt;video and audio transcription and media highlights&lt;/a&gt; and followed up with a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/remix-your-research-with-playlists-on-tags-custom-vocabulary-and-more/&quot;&gt;second release&lt;/a&gt; later in the year that added highlight reels, custom vocabulary, downloading, and more. We shipped new ways to connect Dovetail to other tools with a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/easily-import-zoom-meeting-recordings/&quot;&gt;Zoom integration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/zapier-updates-insight-and-project-triggers/&quot;&gt;updates to our Zapier integration&lt;/a&gt; and added more collaboration features like &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/project-notifications/&quot;&gt;project notifications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/inline-comments-research/&quot;&gt;inline comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;User Research is a rapidly growing discipline, and many organizations are struggling to scale research across multiple teams. The move to remote work—along with new privacy regulations like the GDPR and CCPA—has made this even more challenging, so a focus for us has been helping organizations scale their research securely to uphold their commitments. We launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/enterprise/&quot;&gt;our enterprise plan&lt;/a&gt; with single sign-on; improved our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/&quot;&gt;help center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/categories/security/&quot;&gt;security documentation&lt;/a&gt;; released a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/penetration-testing/&quot;&gt;penetration test report&lt;/a&gt;; and will soon be attested for SOC 2 compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that anyone can do research given the right tools and assistance. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/jumpstart-your-research-journey-with-our-new-analysis-plan/&quot;&gt;Our new Analysis plan&lt;/a&gt; lowers the entry price for Dovetail to $15 / month for one seat, which makes Dovetail accessible to individuals and organizations of all sizes. We launched &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/&quot;&gt;Method in Madness&lt;/a&gt; where we’ve published articles on everything from &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/secret-behind-four-pillars-world-beating-title/&quot;&gt;the world’s best gin distillery&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/what-we-learned-creating-tagging-taxonomy/&quot;&gt;an editorial from Tomer Sharon on creating a tagging taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, we also grew our team from eight to 20 people and moved into our own office in Surry Hills. Having our own space has already had a huge positive impact on our culture and our ability to attract talent. I’m excited to see the team expand further throughout 2021 as we grow our go-to-market, product, and operations teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2021&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ‘perks’ of being a startup is that we always have big, ambitious plans! From doubling our team to making big changes to our product, 2021 is action-packed. We value openness and transparency, both internally with our employees and externally with our customers. That’s why we write posts like this, and it’s why we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/roadmap/&quot;&gt;public roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and an open &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;Slack community&lt;/a&gt;. With that in mind, here’s what we’re thinking for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consumption, discoverability, and impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three themes keep coming up in our research and customer conversations: 1) how researchers can drive consumption of their research; 2) the discoverability of research findings and reports; and 3) how the research team can measure the impact research has within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these problems in mind, we’re planning some significant changes to Dovetail to continue our mission of helping product teams better understand their customers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simplified navigation.&lt;/b&gt; We last changed our navigation over two years ago. Since then, we’ve released lots of new features, and over time Dovetail has become less intuitive for new users. Our new navigation will lower the barrier to entry for research consumers like product managers, designers, executives, and clients, and make research discoverability easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customization features.&lt;/b&gt; To drive consumption and impact of research, we believe it’s important that Dovetail feels like your organization’s ‘research home’. Expect to see new features like a customizable homepage (so you can tailor what consumers initially see), custom branding (to make Dovetail look and feel like your company’s brand), and support for custom domains (so Dovetail can live on your own domain; e.g. acme.research.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new way to curate and report on research.&lt;/b&gt; Traditional research reports are typically long, wordy, offline, non-collaborative, unstandardized, and disconnected from evidence. We’ve heard that researchers are always trying to find ways to make their reports more engaging to increase consumption. In 2021, we’re working on an entirely new way to curate and report on research, and we can’t wait to share more information about this over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Analysis for everyone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re a big fan of democratizing research. We believe more people should be involved in consuming research (and executing on research projects themselves), regardless of their role or place in the organization. We also think that identifying patterns and trends in qualitative data has applications beyond customer research and can extend to market research, sales, customer success, and support. With this broader lens on research, here are three things we’re doing in 2021 to make research analysis with Dovetail available to everyone:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New pricing.&lt;/b&gt; Our new &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/jumpstart-your-research-journey-with-our-new-analysis-plan/&quot;&gt;Analysis plan&lt;/a&gt; makes Dovetail accessible to individuals and organizations of all sizes. It starts from $15 / month for one seat, so whether you’re a ‘research team of one’ in a startup, or a PhD student working on your thesis, you should be able to use Dovetail for your analysis project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embracing flexibility.&lt;/b&gt; Different strokes for different folks — whether you love boards, lists, spreadsheets, or sticky notes, we believe Dovetail should work for you. Expect new ways to view and layout, filter, and organize qualitative data in a way that suits you. More on these changes coming over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transcription improvements.&lt;/b&gt; We’re about to launch French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish support for transcription. Later in the year we’ll release more features like the ability to bring your own transcript, improved export, and captions on videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Participant management, data governance, and compliance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know there are operational challenges that come with managing a research program. This year we’re hoping to launch additional features to help solve the problems we keep hearing from ResearchOps teams:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;People.&lt;/b&gt; Organize your participants in Dovetail, keep track of their details and research activity, link them to the research you&amp;#39;re doing, and segment your data by their demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data governance.&lt;/b&gt; With updated and new privacy regulations such as the GDPR and CCPA coming into effect and expected to strengthen in 2021, we’ll look to build features like data anonymization, de-identification, data retention policies, and right-to-be-forgotten features  to help help teams manage the risk and legal obligations of their research program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scaling to enterprise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, we’ll continue to improve how Dovetail scales for large organizations to better support them in empowering everyone—not just the research team—in making customer-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll invest in features like audit logs to monitor end-user activity, more advanced permissions, branded customization and custom domains, and multi-region support to keep your data within local jurisdictions. We’ll also continue to invest in our internal security, compliance, and privacy programs to give your organization continued confidence and trust in your use of Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Growing our team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to be kicking off the year with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brswift/&quot;&gt;Brian Swift&lt;/a&gt; as our new Head of Product. Brian was most recently the VP Product at SafetyCulture, where he ran product management, design, and research. Before SafetyCulture, Brian worked at Atlassian as a Principal Product Manager, and Twitter and Zynga earlier in his career. We&amp;#39;re very excited to see how Brian helps us execute on our ambitious product plans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as product team growth across designers, engineers, and product managers, we&amp;#39;re also looking to expand our go-to-market team in 2021 with new roles like customer success, dedicated support, and sales. Our aim is to have these roles located in a new second office in the US, so we have better timezone coverage for our northern hemisphere customer base. While we’ll continue with our self-service, product-led model, expect to see more sales assistance for our enterprise customers who need help navigating procurement and rollout of Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our team doubling and a new office on the cards, 2021 will be a huge year for hiring. Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/careers/&quot;&gt;careers page&lt;/a&gt; to see our current open roles and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/heydovetail/&quot;&gt;follow us on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; to see when we post new roles over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thanks for your support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the shadow of 2020 recedes, we look towards what is already turning out to be another big year; one I’m sure will be full of surprises, both welcome and not-so-welcome. Nonetheless, we are very excited for what’s coming next, and for what we can achieve for you—our customers. Because without your support, we couldn&amp;#39;t keep doing what we do. So, thank you from myself and the team, keep your eyes peeled for future updates — we wish you the best for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jumpstart your research journey with our new Analysis plan]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/jumpstart-your-research-journey-with-our-new-analysis-plan</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/jumpstart-your-research-journey-with-our-new-analysis-plan</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, we’ve been building a great product to help researchers and their teams analyze and collaborate on customer research.

A nugget is a combination of an &lt;b&gt;observation&lt;/b&gt; (something we learned), &lt;b&gt;evidence&lt;/b&gt; (video snippet of a user describing the experience in their own words), and &lt;b&gt;tags&lt;/b&gt; that allow for slicing and dicing the data. Insights are then synthesized from collections of nuggets stored in a centralized database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation of a solid atomic research structure is a taxonomy that defines what and how to tag. Tagging decisions turn research into a useful and powerful resource for an organization. Tagging taxonomies establish an agreement about how to collect, interpret, and act on research. They create a shared understanding of an organization’s domain, products, and services. Taxonomies communicate an opinion about what’s important and inspire the exchange of insights across the organization. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/market-research/&quot;&gt;They also order research&lt;/a&gt; so someone new to the organization or a team can quickly get up to speed on the users’ experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The components of an effective taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make a taxonomy of tags relevant and useful, create about 25 tags organized into five groups. Even if you can identify a lot more tags, limiting the taxonomy to 25 tags makes the tagging process quick (just a minute or two per nugget) and effective. We found that overly elaborate taxonomies take more time to tag and are prone to tagging mistakes and other failures. We recommend to keep it relatively simple and straightforward while including a handful of open-ended tags that allow much-needed flexibility. A second critical component of a taxonomy is a clear definition of each tag. The following are the tag groups we found to be useful for us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Procedural:&lt;/b&gt; Tags that provide data about the mechanics of the research and the nugget. Here we tag the media type (video, audio, other), the nugget approval status, methodology used, researchers involved, who nuggetized, and more [&lt;i&gt;NB: creating an atomic level insight, or a nugget, is referred to as nuggetizing, and the researcher conducting the action is a nuggetizer. - Ed.&lt;/i&gt;]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product:&lt;/b&gt; Tags to reflect product-oriented classification, such as the product the nugget is related to (relevant for an organization with a portfolio of products), and additional indications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demographics: &lt;/b&gt;Tags that describe details about the research participant’s demographics. Tags such as age range, gender, geographic location, etcetera, are relevant here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience:&lt;/b&gt; Tags that describe the research participant’s experience. Whether it was positive or negative, frequent or not, which emotions were involved, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Service:&lt;/b&gt; Tags related to service design like the user journey, touchpoints, characters involved as well as free form keywords that describe the content of the nugget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a useful tagging taxonomy is important. As we have created ours and based on past experience in creating taxonomies for other projects and organizations, we have collected ten juicy lessons we have learned along the way. We believe these would be helpful for you when you create (or refresh) your tagging taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning a tagging taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be patient when planning a tagging taxonomy. It is unlikely you will develop a perfect system from the start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create tags with intent, tie them directly to research goals, and evaluate early and often. Consider applying tags across current and future projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are lessons we have learned during the critical stage of planning a taxonomy of tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 1: Consider how tags will be consumed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you choose your tag labels within a tag group, consider how your tags will be consumed. How will other members on the research team and other teams within the organization think to search for and review nuggets? Start with tags that connect directly to your research questions. This will build your framework. From there, think about adding tags within different tag groups as you synthesize your research and as other themes emerge. Remember: You want to make tags both usable for the long term and not too time-consuming to understand. For example, if you have set the research question: What are the positive and negative effects of working from home on employees? It might be a good idea to include a tag such as “Experience vector” with “Positive” and “Negative” value options.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 2: Plan for a learning curve&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start slowly when developing and using a tagging taxonomy. Whether it’s your first time building one or not, plan for a learning curve. This means evaluating your tagging taxonomy as you go. As a team, we would evaluate our taxonomy’s effectiveness after each of us had a chance to synthesize findings into tags. Our conversations led us to make adjustments to the tags as needed, ensuring a universal understanding of the tags, and agreement on proper additions to our tag groups. It’s best to make changes as early on in the process as possible to prevent inconsistencies in tagging; make corrections as needed, and move forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 3: Use universal tags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After we tagged around ten interviews, we determined our taxonomy could be used across our projects. Unfortunately, we did not create the initial tags to be used across projects, preventing us from broadly using them. We ended up recreating our entire tagging taxonomy to include the ability for universal usage across projects. This resulted in having to re-tag all of the nuggets we had previously tagged with the new universal tags, which could have been a tedious process, but it wasn’t too bad since we caught it before we tagged dozens of interviews. As you are planning your tagging taxonomy, make sure what you have created can apply to other projects. If so, set up your tags to a universal usage setting. This will streamline your work and save you precious time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organizing a tagging taxonomy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags introduce a simple way to organize your research. Set the right structure from the onset. This will make it easier down the line to filter for specific tags that can support your insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 4: Just enough tags  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve built a taxonomy, and now it’s time to put it into practice! It’s an exciting moment, and naturally, you are eager to take advantage of each tag as much as possible when looking for research insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In and of themselves, tags do not stand alone, but rather, each tag feeds into the evidence section of a project. As such, a tag is an opportunity to highlight a theme or observation that can help inform future product recommendations or affirm hypotheses. If you include too many tags in your taxonomy, you’ll be overwhelmed with the time required to tag and complexity involved in the process. Too few tags or just allowing nuggetizers to add keywords as tags freely without any structure, and you’ll struggle to capture any insights at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 5: Secondary research tags add depth &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to conducting primary research (i.e., research we conduct directly with participants), we also invest in secondary research. Such research (also called, ’desk research’) involves gathering research others have done or finding other resources which might support our primary research effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We knew we wanted to step outside of our own work and get a higher-level understanding of trends related to the domain we are interested in. For secondary research, we looked to articles, podcasts, webinars, and reports by institutions such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/&quot;&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;. All of these sources were structured around discussing the new work from home experience, and what the future of work might look like, which is the domain we were interested in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through collection, analysis, and compilation of secondary resources, we developed a broad array of secondary research tags. These tags give us insights outside of our own data collection. As a result, we added layers of understanding to why certain themes and topics were popping up in interviews with our participants, and in turn, this helped validate our findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 6: Tying color to action &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of tag colors like a monopoly board – the hues help you understand how far you’ve moved around the board. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, colors allow the tagger to visually skim and remember if they’ve successfully tagged the whole nugget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colors also serve the purpose of signaling sentiment. For us, that meant using a loud stop-sign like red for the tag “Reject” to tie the color to the action. Other options could include red for anger, yellow for neutral, green for happiness, blue for calm; these colors are a good framework. They are well known and easy to recognize for anyone jumping into the tagging process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 7: The Wheel of Emotions &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our experience, it is extremely useful to tag nuggets and research observations with emotions raised by participants during the reported observation. When you slice and dice the data later on, this allows you to find answers to questions such as, “What makes our customers in The Netherlands angry?” (just an example, Dutch friends…).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tagging emotion gets tricky. Dealing with emotion and how it relates to tagging is never going to be perfect. A common practice we chose to draw from is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik&quot;&gt;Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions&lt;/a&gt;. The emotions wheel describes eight basic emotions, providing a broad enough spectrum for most users’ sentiments to be tagged within the framework. We strongly recommend to avoid leaving the emotion tag open-ended, as our experience with such a situation has not been satisfactory. Researchers tended to freely add emotions that were not really emotions (e.g., ‘Feeling informed’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ensuring the quality of a tagging taxonomy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you won’t have all of the information you need when first building out a taxonomy. For this reason, use your research data to inform how your taxonomy grows, and be honest when a tag is either no longer serving a purpose or is missing and needs to be added. It’s important to edit and evolve the taxonomy alongside your growing body of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 8: Define, and then refine &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tagging is an art, not a science. It’s a constant learning process, and we iterated many times over as we began to better understand how tags supported our work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we had multiple conversations about what tags &lt;i&gt;meant&lt;/i&gt;; by discussing and refining, we ensured our team was uniformly aligned and applying each tag correctly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that is to say: Be flexible. Regularly discuss tagging practices and reevaluate what is working and what is not. In our case, we discovered that “Keywords” would be really helpful for our study. We were given free rein to add values under the keywords tag without limits. Through this exercise, we began to see which keywords were popping up often and which ones may have been one-offs that no longer brought value. This allowed us to consolidate overlapping keywords and remove tags that were deemed irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 9: The golden nugget tag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a golden nugget is similar to Charlie finding a golden ticket in the Chocolate Factory. It’s such an exciting moment; it seems too good to be true! A golden nugget is a quote or highlight that stands on its own, well-articulated by the participant, or one which makes a strong case that is hard to dismiss. Golden nuggets suggest major challenges with the brand or a key finding and will be used in the future to represent a point made by multiple other participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above nugget portrays such a strong sentiment in how it relates to the work from home experience. In it, the participant takes an overt stance, proclaiming that “nothing could offset the freedom” of working from home. This statement was significant because it signaled to us the tradeoffs participants were weighing when thinking about the future of work. Although golden nuggets are hard to pin down, we highly recommend including that tag in your taxonomy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Lesson 10: Less (values) is more&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anytime you find yourself questioning whether you should tag something, that probably means you shouldn’t. One tag where this was particularly relevant for us was the “Experience vector” tag. This tag was meant to capture whether the participant had a positive or negative experience working from home. Sometimes though, the vector is neutral. For that reason, we only created two values for the experience vector tag – positive and negative – while deciding that a neutral vector will not get any value, which implies its neutrality. We recommend this approach rather than overloading your taxonomy and adding a third neutral value.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, a tagging taxonomy is one of the most critical components of Atomic Research and will make or break your organization’s ability to gain meaningful insights from users and customers. Done wrong, it might pull the rug from beneath researchers and hurt the trust their organization has put in them to provide valid and reliable insights. Anyone with experience creating tagging taxonomies has learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t. In this article, we shared ten lessons we learned in the past five years about planning, organizing, and ensuring a quality tagging taxonomy. We’d love to learn about your experience doing so as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Tomer Sharon, UX author and cofounder at a stealth mode startup.

Biteable ensures that organizations and individuals can tell stories through the power of video. Regardless of budgets or existing skillsets, Biteable helps you create professional videos in minutes. The Biteable platform empowers millions of people to engage and grow their audience with video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does design and research work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Biteable, product designers and product managers work in small, cross-functional, autonomous teams under the guidance of our Co-founder and Head of Product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-macgregor-biteable/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;James MacGregor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We are all responsible for understanding the needs of our users and developing practical solutions in response. While user research is led by the product team and managed by product designers, almost every function at Biteable communicates directly with our users. The product, engineering, customer success, sales, marketing, and leadership teams all conduct user research in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What challenges do you have with research?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With four designers working across multiple countries and timezones, our design team struggled to coordinate our research efforts in the past. Participant recruitment and insight creation proved to be two of the major issues we faced within our research process. Our workflow and tooling were fragmented and not optimized for gathering insights. Despite being in a relatively good place, we felt we could do better and began to look for tools that would improve our data collection and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were facing significant company growth, hiring loads of people in the product team, and investing heavily in user research. It was clear that we needed to centralize our user research so that anyone in the organization could access and benefit from it. We created a research repository that everyone could contribute research to, and we optimized it to identify patterns, gather evidence, and produce insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does research fit into your design process?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of user research investment, we conduct weekly customer interviews and collate user feedback via our customer success, product, sales, and marketing teams. We also capture information when our CEO conducts customer interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, we spent some time migrating our historical research into Dovetail, which has been key to informing new projects during the discovery phase and understanding key customer concerns over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve found the following features particularly useful:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-data-analysis/&quot;&gt;Tagging&lt;/a&gt; has been incredibly impactful because it’s allowed us to identify trends and patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;Automatic transcriptions&lt;/a&gt; are proving to be a time-saver, and we expect it will improve our documentation as we continue to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/collaborative-research-ops/&quot;&gt;Commenting and insights&lt;/a&gt; are becoming a significant part of our workflow as our research database continues to grow in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How has Dovetail improved upon what you were doing before?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite only moving to Dovetail a couple of months ago, we feel its impact. It enables us to distill information, patterns, and insights into our raw data and maximize our research efforts across teams and geographies. As the design team grows and our research methods improve, we expect Dovetail will streamline our data collection and analysis workflow by removing duplication, minimize dead-ends, strengthen the coordination amongst teams, drive insight gathering, and ultimately save us time, effort, and money so we can focus on doing what we do best — creating the best online video maker for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How has your organization adopted Dovetail?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appetite for more qualitative customer data is strong amongst all of our teams. Until now, the product designers and product managers are the heaviest adopters of Dovetail, but as we continue to use the platform, we’ll collect essential information and gather more data to assist other groups in informing and augmenting their quantitative data-gathering activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Remix your research with playlists on tags, custom vocabulary, and more]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/remix-your-research-with-playlists-on-tags-custom-vocabulary-and-more</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/remix-your-research-with-playlists-on-tags-custom-vocabulary-and-more</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-stories-with-video-highlights/&quot;&gt;we launched media highlights and transcription&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve transcribed and processed tens of thousands of hours of interviews, usability tests, and other research recordings. Today, we’re announcing a massive update to this feature which makes media highlights and transcription better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Highlight reels – a playlist for your tag&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stream a playlist of all video and audio highlights for any tag in Dovetail. This new feature allows you to watch key moments across all of your interviews, usability tests, or other recordings in one continuous experience. Use filter and sort controls—which apply to the playlist along with the highlights underneath—to further refine your clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Create a tag called ‘Must watch’ and add key quotes or moments to this tag during your analysis. Then, share a link to this tag with stakeholders on your team (like a product manager or designer) for them to experience all of the key moments firsthand, to drive more impact with your research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remix and download your own highlight reels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The days of editing in iMovie are over. Download a highlight reel from a single tag, or select a bunch of individual highlights to create your own. Dovetail automatically edits your highlights together into one single MP4 video file that can be shared with stakeholders or clients in presentations and research reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Custom vocabulary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever had a transcription tool stuff up specific lingo or terminology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now when starting a new transcription, you can specify a custom vocabulary of words used in your recording. Our AI speech engine will process your transcript with these words in mind, and will properly capitalize and correct any jargon, proper nouns, company names, product names, or anything else you enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to define a custom vocabulary in Dovetail makes our transcription even more accurate, and saves you precious time usually spent formatting and correcting errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adjustable picture-in-picture and volume&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we’ve made some user experience improvements to enhance video playback while you’re doing your analysis. You can now resize the picture-in-picture player, adjust the volume, and intuitively change, rename, and customize speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, we’d love to hear your feedback on these new updates, along with any ideas you have for making Dovetail even better.

From the age of five, my life centered almost exclusively around ballet and at 16, I became a professional dancer and found myself dancing with several different ballet companies. It wasn’t until I was between contracts at 26, that I took some classes at the San Francisco Community College. I got completely hooked on academia, chose to leave ballet behind, and transferred into &lt;a href=&quot;https://haas.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to apply my acquired business knowledge in a creative space after I graduated, I became a Program Manager in an architecture firm’s innovation studio. We created new products and managed experimental projects centered around how humans relate to the built environment. The designers I worked with daily introduced to design thinking, and I knew I had to learn more. I started an &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.cca.edu/learning/academic-programs/design-strategy-mba/&quot;&gt;MBA in Design Strategy (DMBA) program at California College of the Arts&lt;/a&gt;, the perfect blend of my skills and passions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found myself continually balancing the two sides of myself - the creative, artistic, design side, with the logistical, analytical, operational business side. I knew I wanted to find a place where I could hone and lean into both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of my journey is about finding my way to Design Operations, a burgeoning practice that combined my skills and interests. I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@adaptivepath/were-making-it-official-we-re-capital-one-ffbd26748328&quot;&gt;Adaptive Path at Capital One&lt;/a&gt; as a Design Manager, where I managed large scale service design projects; and defined and scaled the practice of Design Management and Operations. From there, I went on to stand up and lead Design and Research Operations at Uber Eats. As the first person in the team doing this kind of thing, I created necessary foundational processes and systems, improving collaboration and consistency across teams, and growing the Design and Research Ops team. More recently, I moved over to Salesforce’s UX Ops team to lead a new unit within UX Ops called Team Ops. I joined right as COVID was hitting, making it a pretty surreal time to join a new company. I still haven’t met anyone in person but somehow feel the team’s warmth and fantastic culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does UX Ops work at Salesforce?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce gives businesses tools to build stronger and more authentic relationships with their customers on a single customer relationship management (CRM) platform. At Salesforce, our UX teams aspire to make products that people love–products that make a salesperson’s day more productive, a marketer’s campaign more impactful, and a retailer’s website more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind our incredible products are fantastic teams of UX designers and engineers. Working hand-in-hand with those teams is a talented group of professionals that help make it all happen, &lt;b&gt;Salesforce UX Ops&lt;/b&gt;. We’re the scaling engine behind our UX organization, enabling teams of practitioners to deliver customer and business success while they achieve personal and professional growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are systems designers who look up, down, and sideways to identify and share best practices, connect dots across teams, and facilitate cross-team collaboration and alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our UX Ops group consists of two separate but connected teams. The UX Product Operations team goes deep and optimizes for large product design teams. The design program managers are strategic partners for design leaders from each product verticals. Their focus is driving delivery, ensuring quality, and facilitating cross-organizational productivity through expert product and program support. My team, UX Team Operations, goes wide and optimizes for the entire UX function. We focus on community and culture building events and programs, team learning, and growth initiatives. We also look at how to scale systems, tools, and best practices across the UX organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are some of the challenges you’re facing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m laser-focused on understanding how to make it easier to do great work, and while it seems simple, it’s very involved. The first step is finding and accessing all available resources that could equip us because, like most large organizations, we face the challenge of things getting lost in the noise. We have so much rich content and exciting activities to support our UX team, but they’re often hard to find across all the tools, folders, and various owners. Unless you know who to ask and what to ask for, you mightn’t know a resource exists, and then the value is not broadly shared or utilized. We’re trying to solve that with some new initiatives like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UX team site: A team hub acting as a front to door, enabling discovery and access to information, announcements, and resources across UX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX playbooks: Easily digestible guides to help teams understand specific processes or best practices to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX newsletter: A monthly update featuring any relevant announcements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s changing about UX Ops?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re at a point across the design industry where Design and UX Ops is finally understood and valued, at least in larger tech companies and design consultancies. Rather than negotiating for headcount and explaining the value of roles, I’ve seen an incredible change with the demand coming directly from design teams. The practice is evolving from the initial building-out of UX Ops teams to the scaling of those teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an established and mature UX Ops team, we’re in the exciting position of carving a path forward and establishing organizational models to scale the value of UX Ops. We can’t look to other companies for inspiration because a standard way of scaling UX Ops doesn’t currently exist. For us, creating a dedicated horizontal team in UX Ops made sense, but an operations function for a UX team is a relatively nascent practice, so anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons I joined Salesforce was to be part of the tipping point of growth for the evolving practice and define the future for UX Ops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do you do what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am super passionate about Design and UX Ops, and I feel like I’ve been doing it before the design industry even aligned on its name. I love what I do because I see the value and impact of it every day. I’ve heard some version of “how did we survive without you?” on every design team I’ve worked with, and it feels good. On a personal note, I get to flex my service and systems design skills, solve big messy problems, and get to think strategically while also getting dirty in the details when I want. Most importantly, I get to help people. My work makes it easier for designers to focus on designing great products that improve our customer’s lives. I love creating the best working environments for people to grow, connect and thrive as humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to tackle ResearchOps in a rapidly scaling organization]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-tackle-researchops-in-a-rapidly-scaling-organization</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/how-to-tackle-researchops-in-a-rapidly-scaling-organization</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ServiceNow, named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/innovative-companies/#e22fe861d654&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forbes’ #1 Most Innovative Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, delivers digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock productivity. They believe in the power of technology to make work, work better for people. ServiceNow’s Experience Organization (EO) includes over 300 design, research, and product content professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-vinh/&quot;&gt;James Vinh&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sdxd.org/&quot;&gt;SDXD&lt;/a&gt; spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/averriamartin/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;A’verria Martin, Ph.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Manager of Research Operations at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servicenow.com/&quot;&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/a&gt; to learn about how she and her team tackle research operations (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-is-researchops/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ResearchOps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in a rapidly scaling organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did you get involved in ResearchOps?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My formal education and early career was firmly rooted in academia. I spent 15 years as a research assistant, research associate, study coordinator, postdoctoral fellow, and finally as the Director of Research of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/psychiatry/research/division-of-geropsychiatry/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Geriatric Psychiatry Department at UC San Diego&lt;/a&gt;. I also received a Masters and Ph.D. in Marriage and Family Therapy and was a practicing therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been exposed to every facet of the research process: grant writing, funding and budgetary management and constraints, managing study staff, working with Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to approve research plans and study consents, identifying and recruiting research participants, overseeing longitudinal studies with multiple study visits, data collection, analysis and synthesis, and finally sharing research findings through papers and conference presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was ready to leap from academics to corporate, I was fortunate to connect with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsieffert/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Randy Sieffert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Sr. Director of Insights who understood the importance of ResearchOps to scale our research practice at ServiceNow. At the time, the EO was only a few years old, and our Insights Research Organization was about 18 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the mission of ResearchOps at ServiceNow?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We focus on customer engagement and research enablement. Ultimately, our goal is to help the research team operate like a well-oiled machine through a macro and micro level understanding of their needs and goals. We own all aspects of research that block practitioners from focusing on their craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How have your team and the ResearchOps practice evolved?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started at ServiceNow, the Insights Research team and the larger EO were relatively new, giving us the unique opportunity to build from the ground up. I often use the metaphor that we were given a plot of land and asked to build a house: first, we needed to check the zoning, get permits, and start with foundational elements such as installing water and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started with understanding the needs of the researchers and the broader business needs of the company. Because I’m a researcher by training (and at heart), I also looked to literature to guide our efforts. I found that unlike&lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/designops-the-questions-youre-probably-asking-yourself-now-fdac491bfe4f&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;DesignOps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which had a dense set of directives, ResearchOps was a new and emerging field that’s only in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/researchops-community/the-eight-pillars-of-user-research-1bcd2820d75a&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eight Pillars of ResearchOps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; inspired me: environment, scope, people, organizational context, recruitment and admin, data knowledge and management, governance, and tools and infrastructure. I used this theoretical model to create quantitative questions around each pillar, ensuring the team could rate ourselves bi-annually and create a roadmap for the areas unique to the use case that we needed to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s room for growth across all areas, we’re currently dedicated to four based on our organizational needs and customer-centricity. They are recruitment and admin, people, data knowledge and management, and governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recruitment and administration: Customer access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being an enterprise software company, access to customers who use our products across all job roles and functions introduces some unique challenges. Unlike consumer products who can often find research participants in a cafe or at an airport, our participants aren’t easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been like running power to our plot of land. With the expertise of Customer Engagement Program Manager, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjelicamationg/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anjelica (AJ) Mationg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we built a robust customer engagement operating procedure to identify, vet, recruit, schedule, and incentivize study participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to our success is establishing valuable relationships with colleagues across the company who assist us in identifying and vetting target users for each unique study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our workflows and processes in place, we’ve switched gears to focus on growing our &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.servicenowproductlab.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ServiceNow Product Lab Insider Program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This elite research community informs our roadmap and product decisions through quantitative and qualitative research studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;People: Winning as a team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve developed various initiatives to ensure the internal success of our Insights Research team, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolling out a rich onboarding process on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindtickle.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mindtickle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; platform where we continually add training and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing job classifications (currently being refreshed based on feedback) to outline expectations and support career growth conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting training on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotjar.com/usability-testing/&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;usability testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;heuristic evaluation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-design-101/&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;service design&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we are excited about our upcoming five-session speaker training. That said, we are dedicated to continually growing our talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-munoz-1bb47611/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michelle Munoz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (on my team) has served as a cultural ambassador, organizing quarterly team building (paintball anyone?) and quarterly volunteer opportunities. She has even established a “quaranteam” check-in to keep us all connected during COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data knowledge and management: Insights that drive business value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and knowledge management is front-and-center for our team. Our market, product, UX, and / or customer research aims to drive insights and critical findings into creating better product experiences and driving business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a ResearchOps perspective, we manage competitive information using platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.forrester.com/blogs/category/user-experience-ux/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forrester&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, develop systems to tag and store research findings that are easily consumable and usable by the product organization and consider different avenues to share critical insights with internal and external stakeholders. While this is a multi-year project, we’ve made some significant strides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such stride was bringing on an Insights Librarian (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisaewing/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Elisa Ewing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who leads our competitive intelligence efforts and streamlines our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;research repository&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we store artifacts. Elisa is working with a tiger team to develop an insights tracker to follow our research findings as they are driven into product and inform business decisions, and has identified opportunities for sharing knowledge to internal and external stakeholders through various channels. Another incredible stride is creating a tool for managing research requests that assist us with data and knowledge management and supports capacity planning and forecasting research coverage by product portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Governance: Protecting the customer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This area’s near and dear to my heart. Coming from an academic background and working with IRBs to consider human subjects protection, I could see several considerations for a maturing organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year I’ve worked closely with our incredible ServiceNow legal team to evolve our governance approach to human subject research. This includes reviewing and updating Customer Service Agreements with our agency partners, developing various statement of work templates, collaborating with product legal to bring training to our Insights Research team, and considering modifications to study consents, NDAs, Safe Harbor, and other documentation to keep our research participants informed and our business protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the four pillars have been our primary focus, we&amp;#39;ve made the following movement in other areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment: Increasing the visibility of research across the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scope: Creating a repository of methods, templates, and shared processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizational context: Building a system to track operational spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools and infrastructure: Identifying and procuring research tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What challenges are you facing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number one challenge we’ve faced is customer access for research engagements. Like any business, you have to navigate internal teams and processes; this is why building strong relationships within the company is a catalyst for our success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with our colleagues’ support, the ability to identify and connect with the target user has proven another challenge. Often the individual who is the primary decision-maker is not the person we need to participate in our studies. This is where the creation of a robust customer panel - ServiceNow Product Lab - as well as the strong internal relationships, have proven beneficial. That said, this continues to be a challenge, and we’re constantly looking for creative solutions. I’m excited about the new phase of maturity we’ll enter when this is no longer a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s your advice for people new to ResearchOps?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the unique needs of your team and company; what are the areas that need immediate attention versus those that could be incorporated in a long-range roadmap or tackled collaboratively by the broader research team. Do not try to attack everything at once and consider investing in foundational aspects before aesthetics. Don’t start to drywall before you have poured your foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply human-centered design and design thinking to the challenges you face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for our team to use a design thinking process (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test) when creating new processes. We’ve recently been considering the fully digital class of new hires and interns; we used empathy mapping techniques and &lt;i&gt;how we might&lt;/i&gt; make a checklist for virtual onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be as agile as possible and keep moving; don’t let perfection be the enemy of getting things done! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of every template, process, or workflow as a pilot; it’s better to get the materials out to the team, get feedback, and improve than wait for the final version. Don’t be worried about continual process improvement or needing multiple iterations; the perfect process doesn’t exist; we should always improve based on experience. Also, remember that effective processes should not be cumbersome. If it slows researchers down, then it’s not a good process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ A guide to running unmoderated usability tests]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-running-unmoderated-tests</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-running-unmoderated-tests</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Usability tests aren’t the sexiest part of user research, but regularly conducting them can be a strong signal of a healthy product development process. This article will help you get from burning questions about your product to sharing actionable insights with your whole team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Structure the test with research questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no real point running a usability test unless you know what you should be testing. A research plan is useful for designing the usability test, picking the research questions, and figuring out how to use those questions as your test’s backbone. Essentially, one research question should equate to one task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that we’re an adblocking company trying to find out how our customers use our ‘block element’ feature. The product manager wants to know: Do users manage to block specific elements on a website using our feature? And if they’re going to revert their action, can they do so easily? We now have the two tasks that we will complement with follow up questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let the participant do (most of) the work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve decided to use the research methodology of unmoderated usability testing, chances are your main priority is the speed at which you can get to the insights phase. The last thing you want to do is spend hours sifting through videos and documenting related notes. Alternatively, asking the participants to capture their impressions is an excellent way to save time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the same ad blocking example, you should structure the questions in the following flow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participant performs the task and comments out loud: You’re annoyed by the Marketplace images on Facebook. Show us how you’d block those images using your adblocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participant provides a written rating of their experience of the task: On a scale of one to five, how easy was it to block the Facebook Marketplace images? One indicates very difficult, and five indicates very easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participant provides a written explanation of the rating they indicated: Can you explain why you chose the rating you did? Please be as specific as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;By designing the test in this way, it should be easy to understand what worked and what didn’t by merely skimming through the participant notes on your usability testing platform. The next essential step is to verify that the participants’ notes line up with their behaviors. You can do this by jumping through the videos to identify any apparent contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Be as clear as possible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the significant differences between moderated and unmoderated usability tests is how the participant engages. In an unmoderated usability test, the participant only interacts with the prototype and not with a moderator. They don’t feel like they have anything to prove to a moderator, and they’re less likely to seek clarification when faced with ambiguous instructions. They don’t focus on whether they interpret the question correctly or not, often answering as quickly as possible. Because the participant is only interacting with the prototype, there isn’t the opportunity for a moderator to ask any follow-up questions. Therefore, for the sake of clarity, you should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give one instruction per sentence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What not to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show us how you would prevent those pictures from showing and click on complete once you are done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show us how you would prevent those pictures from showing. Click on complete once you are done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid blocks of texts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to add context or a scenario, avoid blocks and start new paragraphs whenever appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What not to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s imagine you are on Facebook. On the right side, there are pictures of the listings you recently looked at on the Facebook Marketplace. You are annoyed by them and wish they didn&amp;#39;t appear anymore. You remember that your adblocker has a feature that enables you to block elements on a page. Show us how you would prevent those pictures from showing. Click on complete once you are done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s imagine you are on Facebook. On the right side, there are pictures of the listings you recently looked at on the Facebook Marketplace. You are annoyed by them and wish they didn&amp;#39;t appear anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You remember that your adblocker has a feature that enables you to block elements on a page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show us how you would prevent those pictures from showing. Click on complete once you are done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have doubts about wording, ask a couple of colleagues (native speakers are particularly helpful ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Always do a dry run before you launch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before launching, you should go through each step of your test as if you were the participant. Most usability testing software should have a feature allowing this. Look out for spelling or grammatical errors, confusing instructions, or incorrect ordering of questions. Even after a thorough review (possibly by a fellow UX researcher or a member of your product team), it’s impossible to be certain that your test will run smoothly. The only way to truly find out is to put your test out in the world and observe how one or two participants manage it. After real-life confirmation that everything works, you should feel confident to launch the test with the required number of participants.

How do you do it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; Internal buy-in for research is a marathon, not a sprint. You can&amp;#39;t expect your stakeholders to change their perception of research within a short time. I believe you have to show, not say, with research – so definitely ask for forgiveness, not permission, to conduct research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, getting that initial buy-in is about showing a quick-win outcome that provides a clear benefit to your stakeholder. I&amp;#39;d suggest using an &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques/&quot;&gt;evaluative methodology&lt;/a&gt;, such as running a usability test or a survey to secure buy-in. These approaches are low-effort and are quick to execute, giving you time to craft meaningful and sticky insights to share back with your stakeholders to show the value of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have stakeholder interest, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-qualitative-research-process-end-to-end/&quot;&gt;guide them through the research journey&lt;/a&gt; – from the research plan to execution, to the final reports. Having stakeholders involved in crafting questions, observing sessions, and providing feedback on potential recommendations gives them accountability to the research outcome. It will make them feel like they have skin in the game and help them understand the stages within a research project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also important to positively incentivize research input. Even if a stakeholder shows up to one session, or contributes one question, make sure you recognize their contribution. It will encourage them to continue participating in your research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, getting stakeholders to attend the sessions, getting them to write notes, it&amp;#39;s the secret sauce, because if they&amp;#39;re attending a session and you tell them, &amp;quot;Hey, you need to write notes,&amp;quot; they have to listen to the research versus just observing. Even if the insights that they capture are not relevant to what you&amp;#39;re doing, the fact that they&amp;#39;ve listened to that interview will resonate with them in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you have to be your own biggest cheerleader. Over-communicate, repeat and share your insights with as many people as you can within your organization. Leverage different communication channels you have – is there a way to share an insight on Slack, or via email or in a meeting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What happens when you have no budget to conduct research?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever been in a situation within my career where I&amp;#39;ve ever had enough budget for research. I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marissamayer&quot;&gt;Marissa Mayer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s quote, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creativity loves constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher, I find it an exciting challenge to figure out more creative or hacky ways to get to the answers I need with a limited budget. Generally, if you need funding for a research project, it will be either &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-best-platforms-for-recruiting-user-research-participants/&quot;&gt;recruiting participants&lt;/a&gt; or paying for software subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find participants at a minimal cost, you can leverage existing customer or newsletter databases, post on social media, or join relevant communities or groups. If you have a small budget, you can also consider targeted ads on social media for participants that may fit into the required user type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also consider guerilla research to reach out to people in a public setting - such as a mall or train station – and ask them to participate. However, if you plan on running guerilla research, ensure you&amp;#39;re in a location that doesn&amp;#39;t ban solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For software subscriptions, this will depend on the type of methodology you are running. You can generally hack your way around the Google or Microsoft suites to do most things - for example, using a shared Google Slides or Jamboard for co-design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one non-negotiable for budget – incentives. If someone takes the time to participate in research for you or your company&amp;#39;s benefit, then you should fairly compensate them for their time. Incentives don&amp;#39;t always need to be cash though - you can use vouchers, product discounts, or gift baskets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are always trade-offs to consider. A limited budget means less rigor in the research process. Less rigor in research means you may potentially have less accurate data to analyze. However, by providing value to your stakeholders with limited-budget research, you will be able to put yourself into a position to request budget in the long term because you have shown that it&amp;#39;s a worthwhile investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to collaborate with stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;To what extent are product managers involved in user research? How should researchers and product managers interact?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; Product managers need to combine the customer insight with the business insight to decide product priorities. Product managers will always talk to customers, but you want to make sure that, as a researcher, you can bring other perspectives and data to the conversation, to decide on product priorities as a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between research and product is the most crucial partnership, and as a researcher, I involve product managers throughout the entire research process. You should train product managers on research techniques, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tips-for-having-research-conversations/&quot;&gt;coaching them to capture meaningful insights&lt;/a&gt;, and align them with your research goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What would you say to engineers who want to start building something while the user research is still underway?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; I would look for ways to work with the timeline, allowing the engineers to build things that aren&amp;#39;t influenced by the research outcomes but trying to hold off on making something impacted by the research outcomes. I&amp;#39;ll try to work with the engineering manager or the product manager to secure the breathing room to complete the research. Moving forward, I&amp;#39;d build in some contingency time to the research timeline to ensure that you are getting those findings complete before engineering involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One time I ended up writing my research outputs as user stories in Jira. So rather than doing a research report, I wrote the user story so the engineers could quickly get in and prioritize, rather than going through that reporting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If a stakeholder comes to you with a requirement, what happens if the research doesn&amp;#39;t back them up? How do you convince them it&amp;#39;s a bad idea?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; To begin with, I would try to understand why they want to build a particular feature. Using the &amp;#39;five whys&amp;#39; technique helps get to the root understanding of their decision. It might be that the stakeholder has decided they need to build the feature because there&amp;#39;s a customer that&amp;#39;s advocating for it. It also means that the end-customer will likely need to justify their need. Having that shared understanding can be crucial. By becoming a trusted advisor with your different stakeholders, you can work with them to figure out the knowledge gaps and find the best solutions to fill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There are situations when everyone in the team is in a hurry to get the report or insights. How much time should a researcher spend on analysis, especially in such scenarios?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; There is always going to be tension between balancing rigor in research and sharing research efficiently. Although you may feel pressure to work faster, make sure you&amp;#39;re not sacrificing speed for finding the right insights. By keeping your stakeholders updated throughout your research, you can start sharing insights when you begin solidifying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to share your findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When is a good time to start sharing your user research?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; The sooner, the better. You want to avoid a situation where you hide away for weeks (or months!) to come back and have your stakeholders not use your research. Keep your stakeholders updated throughout your research journey. Allow them to provide feedback on potential recommendations or findings to give them accountability to the research outcome, always setting expectations that your results are a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do you incorporate your opinion in your research output?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; When you want to embed yourself in the product team with engineering, product, and design – you need to become the trusted advisor. You want to be the researcher that can capture all of the disparate knowledge floating around an organization. Every organization is full of teams talking to users meaning there is more research to uncover. Being able to come back to a product manager with a point of view is vital for any researcher because it enables the researcher to influence the product in a customer-centric way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encourage researchers to ensure their end game expresses a point of view and action items to share with stakeholders. Rather than overwhelming them with a bunch of information, they only need to read a handful of takeaways, giving them the essence of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When presenting the insights and findings to the stakeholders, what evidence do you usually add to the deck?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; There are two ways of presenting research insights: deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is where you provide the context, justification, then the outcome as the conclusion. Inductive reasoning is when you give the decision upfront, then explain afterward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research reports should be presented with inductive reasoning because it offers your perspective as an executive summary. The first thing your stakeholders see is the answer. They don&amp;#39;t have to wait for a one-hour presentation to get to those insights. Make sure that your report is easy to digest. Try to avoid rows and rows of text but include three or four insights, maybe a quote or a video. Focus on clearly visualizing your findings so that your stakeholders can understand the message you&amp;#39;re trying to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with stakeholders is a marathon, not a sprint. By taking all of your stakeholders on the journey throughout the full research experience, you can show the value of qualitative research and encourage buy-in for future research investment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using qualitative research to make an impact]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/using-qualitative-research-to-make-an-impact</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/using-qualitative-research-to-make-an-impact</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of corporate time, quantitative data has dominated boardrooms, annual reports, and executives&amp;#39; minds. The appeal is obvious: big numbers, broad trends, colorful graphs, and pie charts galore. However, quantitative data only tells you half of the story. Academy Xi&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/contributors/eric-lutley/&quot;&gt;Eric Lutley&lt;/a&gt; posed a bunch of questions to User Research Leader &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/contributors/jess-nichols/&quot;&gt;Jess Nichols&lt;/a&gt; about the other half of the story—qualitative research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Qualitative and quantitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How would you define the difference between qualitative and quantitative research?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-quantitative-research/&quot;&gt;Qualitative research&lt;/a&gt; focuses on context and observations. Using unstructured data, you can genuinely understand people&amp;#39;s attitudes around their experiences and gather rich insights from your users. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-quantitative-research/&quot;&gt;Quantitative data&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, focuses on behavioral insight captured through structured data like analytics and surveys. You are trying to generalize your understanding to paint a broad picture of your audience understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you combine qualitative and quantitative research?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; Quantitative research will show you &amp;#39;what&amp;#39; is happening while qualitative research explains &amp;#39;why&amp;#39; something is happening. For example, when looking at quantitative analytics, you can see what process or flow people are taking. Still, you don&amp;#39;t necessarily build understanding around why they&amp;#39;re taking that flow, which can lead to assumptions about the &amp;#39;why,&amp;#39; including false assumptions based on their existing domain knowledge. Combining the quantitative data you&amp;#39;re capturing with the qualitative &amp;#39;why&amp;#39; is a research superpower that confirms hypotheses and ensures you make the right improvements to your product experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How and when to run research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a product manager or designer, how can you conduct research effectively?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; There are nuances around techniques and how to do research, so if it&amp;#39;s an option, always try to engage a researcher. Researchers train in exercising neutrality and are skilled in the art of capturing insights from a variety of information sources. When this isn&amp;#39;t possible, organizations often look to product managers or designers to conduct research. Interested in what is a user researcher and what do they do? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/what-is-a-user-researcher/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; I wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something to be aware of are the biases product managers or designers may have when they start conversations. Suppose a designer designed a particular experience and are conducting a usability test on that same experience. In that case, they may assume that some pain points that users have identified aren&amp;#39;t valid because they don&amp;#39;t fit the mental model that the designer has. Or a product manager could be influenced by a conversation they had with a high-value customer. They run the risk of identifying pain points that don&amp;#39;t fit within the broader customer base&amp;#39;s experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When is the best time to conduct qualitative research during a product or project lifecycle?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; There are multiple opportunities to research throughout the product lifecycle. I feel like people think research is always an intense and laborious process, but there are ways to do quick, light-touch research that still gives you directional validation. In my opinion, there are two main areas where qualitative research can be most effective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before product scoping: &lt;/b&gt;Before you start to build out the experience, you want to understand where the knowledge gaps are and identify essential customer pain points—helping you make decisions around product prioritization and maintain a clear focus on your customers&amp;#39; needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before engineering: &lt;/b&gt;Generally, more evaluative research occurs at this stage, like usability testing or information architecture testing. You want to make sure that the experience meets your customer needs before you invest your engineering capacity heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/01/23/how-ux-is-transforming-business-whether-you-want-it-to-or-not/#2d5aa97580e6&quot;&gt;Forrester, via Forbes, calculates that $1 invested in UX returns $100&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on understanding your users&amp;#39; needs when creating a product helps you avoid the burden of change management or product rebuilding down the track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you convince stakeholders that research is necessary?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; Soft skills for research are essential. Many people assume that if you&amp;#39;re a researcher, then the bulk of your effort is focused on using the right methodologies and executing the research itself. What I have found throughout my career is that softer skills are just as relevant. Being skilled in communication, presenting, and influencing is particularly important because a successful research project relies on your stakeholders&amp;#39; buy-in. I&amp;#39;ve had experiences where product managers think they have the right solution. Still, I&amp;#39;ve spent time influencing them to understand their own biases and other perspectives they may need to consider to ensure they meet the customers&amp;#39; needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are your top tips for the interview process?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; Although an interview seems like a simple conversation on the surface, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tips-for-having-research-conversations/&quot;&gt;researchers use many research techniques to maximize the conversations&amp;#39; output&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some approaches that I use in my interviews:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building rapport:&lt;/b&gt; I spend the first half of my interviews focused solely on building rapport with the participant. Building rapport is incredibly important in creating trust. It enables your participants to be more open to tough topics in conversations, leading to better input and research insights. However, building rapport takes time. The same way you wouldn&amp;#39;t share your innermost secrets on a first date, you have to take some time to build trust and rapport. Participants aren&amp;#39;t going to share their real thoughts with you on the first question you ask if you&amp;#39;ve never spoken to them before. The first half of my interviews include getting to know you questions and setting the context for the conversation - so questions generally grounded in fact. By the time I&amp;#39;ve built rapport halfway through, I can start asking for their opinions and pain points on topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questioning technique:&lt;/b&gt; I am very thoughtful about how I ask questions. When we think of interview questions - there are two types of questioning: Open questions (those with free-form answers) and closed questions (those with a yes or no response). We generally want to funnel from open questions to closed questions during an interview. We should never start with closed or leading questions during conversations as it can bias our participants&amp;#39; answers towards our assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way you move from open to closed questioning is through three stages. The discovery stage is where you ask open-ended questions - this could result in any response. Then there is the validation stage. You ask probing or clarifying questions to the previous open response before you head into the paraphrasing stage, where you repeat the answer back to the participant to make sure you have a shared understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What recommendations do you have for researching a subject beyond your knowledge or experience?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; When I was a consultant, I would face this situation when I started a new project because I&amp;#39;d be working with a client, and I didn&amp;#39;t have all the context. There was pressure to know what you were talking about very quickly. To solve this, I would engage with stakeholders who were happy to help me level-up on the subject matter. It&amp;#39;s essential to be very open and honest with people that you&amp;#39;re talking to, identifying that you don&amp;#39;t have a depth of experience, and let them know you&amp;#39;re still learning. You could always complement your learning through secondary research like industry reports, news articles, or blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, when I am an expert in an area, I will go into these conversations, pretending not to know anything. While I think I have a pretty good idea of what they&amp;#39;re going to say, I will go in with a beginner&amp;#39;s mindset in these meetings to avoid any assumptions. I want to learn, and I want to relearn every single time I have conversations because there could be something I&amp;#39;m assuming that mightn&amp;#39;t be correct. So even if I have the domain knowledge, I will go in as if I don&amp;#39;t have it to ensure I learn as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Moving from capturing to analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When do you decide that you&amp;#39;ve completed your research and can move into the insight phase?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; When you start to identify recurring patterns and hear the same thing repeatedly in the conversations you&amp;#39;re having, it&amp;#39;s probably a valuable time to pause and make sure you have the information you need to move to the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How much research is too much research, and how long does research usually last?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; The length of research heavily depends on the methodology, scope, and participants for research. In some cases, you can complete usability testing for five participants in a day. In other cases, it can take up to a month to recruit participants - especially in the B2B space when you have to secure buy-in from the participants&amp;#39; account manager. Do not conduct research if you are confident in your hypotheses - this makes research a validation exercise when research is so much more than that. If you&amp;#39;re running a study and are getting repetitive answers, pause your research to determine if there are any additional gaps in your knowledge or a comprehensive enough data set to begin your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Analyzing and leveraging unstructured data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you make sense of unstructured data?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; Dovetail is &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-data-analysis/&quot;&gt;an excellent tool for this&lt;/a&gt;. In recent research I conducted, I find researchers fall into two main buckets of how they analyze: Team Spreadsheet or Team Sticky Note. Team Spreadsheet focuses on having a structured information architecture and finding insights that fit within an existing mental model. In contrast, Team Sticky Note is focused on organic analysis and the affinity of data to find their insights. Each approach has trade-offs you have to consider. Having a predefined information architecture can constrain you from discovering novel insights. An organic process requires a more extended timeframe to conduct your analysis. You can also see a combination of both approaches. Another incredibly important soft skill is storytelling. You need to have stickiness with the insights that you are sharing to resonate with your stakeholders. I focus on creating a structure out of the unstructured data and then moving towards the art of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is one of these approaches better than the other?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; If you&amp;#39;re doing &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/generative-evaluative-research/&quot;&gt;foundational generative work&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;re better off doing something organic like affinity analyses because you can find insights without having inherent biases. Generally, evaluative research is going to be much more useful for a spreadsheet because you&amp;#39;re looking at &amp;#39;what is the task?&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;what did this participant do?&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you leverage the outputs of qualitative research in a project?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; It depends on the type of research that you&amp;#39;re conducting. It&amp;#39;s essential to visualize your insights to resonate with your stakeholders if it&amp;#39;s foundational or generative. You want to get buy-in and ensure the information can be easily digested by just looking at it, so your stakeholders understand the findings. Utilizing things like personas or journey maps can be incredibly useful to visualize the experiences and users that your research focuses on. I&amp;#39;ve heard of people building out courses or one-pagers that they stuck around their office. With evaluative research, you want to be tactical and grounded in the designs. If you&amp;#39;re doing usability testing, you want your recommendations to be incredibly actionable so that a designer or an engineer can make that change as quickly as possible. Not many people want to look through a long list of insights. They&amp;#39;re looking for the research point of view and the action items that they need to take as part of their role. Expertly translating the depth of data that you have into something engaging is critical in ensuring your research resonates with your stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you maximize novel insights for remote working?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; Collaboration can be more challenging when everyone&amp;#39;s remote. There are many collaborative tools and platforms out there that aim to help you &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/collection-analysis-remote-research/&quot;&gt;analyze your research data remotely&lt;/a&gt;. The way you make them work for you depends heavily on whether you&amp;#39;re Team Spreadsheet or Team Sticky Note. Dovetail, Google Sheets, Miro, and Mural are the ones that come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, qualitative research helps articulate the &amp;#39;why&amp;#39; to complement the &amp;#39;what&amp;#39; of quantitative data. Regardless of whether the analysis approach is structured or unstructured, qualitative research focuses on finding actionable outcomes for teams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research participants: What does good look like?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-participants-what-does-good-look-like</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-participants-what-does-good-look-like</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding the relevant and right participants to engage in your qualitative research activities is no small feat. Academy Xi&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/contributors/eric-lutley/&quot;&gt;Eric Lutley&lt;/a&gt; posed a bunch of questions to User Research Leader &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/contributors/jess-nichols/&quot;&gt;Jess Nichols&lt;/a&gt; about how researchers should leverage as many sources as possible to achieve this, being aware of potential biases within each of these sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding participants and patterns in conversations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eric: Is there a right number in how many people you need to go out and research?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jess:&lt;/b&gt; That&amp;#39;s the million-dollar question. The number of conversations needed to build confidence primarily depends on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques/&quot;&gt;the methodology&lt;/a&gt; you use and the different research segments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/&quot;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group suggests testing with five users in discussions with a usability focus&lt;/a&gt;. For exploratory research, like interviews, I aim for eight to 10 participants per segment. This number ensures you can identify patterns, similarities, or differences in your participants&amp;#39; responses and allow you to dive deeper into nuances you may discover during research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always set expectations with stakeholders. Identify who you did, and didn&amp;#39;t interview as part of your research—indicating that you&amp;#39;ve engaged with all customers when you&amp;#39;ve only spoken to customers from a specific industry or the highest spenders can bias your findings to your stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;E: When you&amp;#39;re doing interviews, do you sometimes receive information entirely out of left field, causing you to go in a different direction?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J:&lt;/b&gt; Absolutely. You&amp;#39;re not researching to check a box, the whole point of conducting research is because you don&amp;#39;t know things, right? You have to be open to discovery during research and give yourself enough flexibility to receive information from different audiences and experiences. If you feel there&amp;#39;s a discovery of note but not enough time to explore, connect with your stakeholders to discuss future research opportunities. Let them know that there could be a lot of insight gained from further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bias in participants and insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;E: If you were to leverage an existing fan base of a product through social media, is there a danger of getting biased interviewees?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J:&lt;/b&gt; You&amp;#39;d be surprised, I&amp;#39;ve found that people that are super-engaged with a product often have strong opinions about it because they&amp;#39;re passionate. You could also explore the fan bases of competing products and see the difference in the input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;E: If you were to reach out to a fan of a competitor product and discuss things they love and hate, what would you do with that information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J:&lt;/b&gt; It&amp;#39;s vital to get conflicting insights; it would be a red flag if you didn&amp;#39;t. When it comes to considering how to apply insights to the product, we have to take different perspectives; it&amp;#39;s not just one point of view that we take into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes back to the trade-off. If you want to ensure diversity in participants, you need to spend the budget to either pay for a vendor to recruit or find other audiences. If this isn&amp;#39;t possible, you need to be self-aware to know you aren&amp;#39;t talking to every person I should talk to, but I&amp;#39;m going to set that expectation in my findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;E: What is your take on services that find participants for you?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J:&lt;/b&gt; It depends on the audience you&amp;#39;re after. In a previous role, I looked for a specific user type with a particular set of behaviors. The channels that I had available to me weren&amp;#39;t helping me access this audience, so we used a third-party vendor to recruit. It meant that we were paying to get access to each participant, but ultimately that process enabled us to uncover the insights we needed to make product decisions. It&amp;#39;s an investment, but if you need it, it can be a great option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Incentives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;E: Is there a rule of thumb around incentives?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J:&lt;/b&gt; The amount of incentive you should offer depends on the type of audience you&amp;#39;re looking for - easier to recruit participants for quick research will be lower in cost than harder to recruit for participants or longer sessions. If you&amp;#39;re finding that you aren&amp;#39;t getting the type of participants you need, you could always reassess the incentive you&amp;#39;re offering during your research period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;E: What are the best ways to get cheap or free participants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J:&lt;/b&gt; There&amp;#39;s a trade-off to consider with cheap or free participants because you won&amp;#39;t be able to be picky with who you choose. Less choice may lead to less rigor in your research - so be sure to set expectations with stakeholders with whom you did and didn&amp;#39;t include in your research. In saying that, some of the ways you can source cheap or free participants are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends, family, and personal social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging company CRMs or databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting on your company&amp;#39;s social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting with digital groups in relevant communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying for targeted ads on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;E: How do you prevent the disconnect between the answers you receive and the users&amp;#39; final actions?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J:&lt;/b&gt; It&amp;#39;s essential to set expectations around attitudinal insights versus behavioral insights. I love this great quote from Margaret Mead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What people say, what people do, and what they say they do are entirely different things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you capture your insights, make sure you&amp;#39;re considering what is behavioral (i.e., what they do) and attitudinal (i.e., what they say). It&amp;#39;s also important to be careful about what people say they do. Many people make the wrong assumption that this is behavioral when it&amp;#39;s attitudinal because it&amp;#39;s the participant&amp;#39;s perspective and bias on what they do. As a researcher, you aren&amp;#39;t able to tell the future; you can only determine what is most likely to happen based on what you learn through research. If your hypothesis ends up being incorrect, take the lessons learned from the study and outcome and incorporate that into your next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/recruiting-participants-user-research/&quot;&gt;Finding the right participants&lt;/a&gt; is integral for researchers to ensure they can accurately answer the open questions they are investigating within their research. Tapping into all possible networks ensures you find the best participants for your research needs. It&amp;#39;s essential to set expectations with your stakeholders on who you did and didn&amp;#39;t engage as part of your research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An inside look at design research at Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-research-design-team</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-research-design-team</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we believe we’re onto something special in the way we approach research and design. Over the past year, we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/about/&quot;&gt;grown our team substantially&lt;/a&gt; and ushered in a new era of customer understanding. Here to provide an inside view into design, research, and everything in between is Senior UX Designer, Lucy Denton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can you tell us about Dovetail?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s a Sydney based startup founded a couple of years back. It’s a qualitative research analysis and repository platform, with big goals to grow. Our mission is to help anyone in a product organization make better decisions founded in customer knowledge, whether it’s exploratory interviews, usability tests, product feedback, or any other form of qualitative data collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the focus on research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the researcher has really come into their own. They&amp;#39;re viewed as a trusted advisor to other teams and the owner of the customer perspective. The researcher ultimately ensures that products and services are centered around the customer. Not every organization has a researcher, but every organization is conducting research in some form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer knowledge is often scattered, making it incredibly fragmented and hard to find previous research. Dovetail wants to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-repository/&quot;&gt;bring all research into a single home&lt;/a&gt; where it can be analyzed and served back to the business, making insights accessible to everybody within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s it like to research researchers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research varies based on what we’re trying to achieve. If we’re looking to solve knowledge gaps, we may run &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/generative-evaluative-research/&quot;&gt;generative and foundational research&lt;/a&gt; to build a strong point of view around our customer needs. If we’re conducting evaluative research, we may test product experiences or hypotheses to meet customer needs. Regardless of the type of research, we take the team along for the research journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the team involved in research planning gives them a robust understanding of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it. By the time we finish the project, they understand the what, the how, and the why of it all. We store all our previous research data in Dovetail, enabling us to have first-hand experience in understanding what our customers go through when using the product. We also encourage the team to assist in our synthesis so that everyone experiences what it’s like to synthesize in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get to research those who research - whether it’s a researcher, designer, or product manager - and make sure that Dovetail reflects their needs and sets them up for success. We’re focused on understanding different facets of the research ecosystem to prioritize which big product bets we should be investing in next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to be in a team that advocates for research as a way to help them build the best possible product. I’m empowered to look for ways to impact the way that people research and, ultimately, help them become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s design like at Dovetail?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s pretty unique when it comes to the view on design because Benjamin, Dovetail&amp;#39;s CEO and co-founder, has a UX design background. He and I met when we both worked as designers at Atlassian. It’s common for designers to fight for UX improvements and prioritization of research, but at Dovetail, the whole team understands the value of great UX. We have an inclusive research and design process with pretty much the entire company getting involved in the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of my process, the first step is understanding the problem we’re trying to solve. This could mean digging through feedback we collect in-product, support emails, asking questions directly on our Slack community, or conducting research. When I have the context I need, I’ll start creating wireframes and iterating towards high fidelity designs. If it’s a brand new experience, sometimes I’ll run ideation workshops with other members of the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have another ritual called design sparring. Design sparring starts with sharing in-progress work for feedback, having a discussion around the work, and then iterating on the designs as a result. If there are things we want to validate, I’ll make a prototype of the experience, and we’ll share it with some customers for light-weight usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the diversity of work in my role as Senior UX Designer. For the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/generative-evaluative-research/&quot;&gt;generative research&lt;/a&gt; project we’re working on to understand the research ecosystem, I get to interview people, analyze the research data, and facilitate design workshops with the team. Then I’ll pivot to lead the design vision side of the project to visualize the product strategy. I try to truly understand our customers’ problems, needs, and other product opportunities—and create solutions with delightful user experiences. I’ll work closely with research, as well as engineering, to implement designs. It’s a creative job, but there are also tried and true processes to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s next for Dovetail?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re growing the team! We’re particularly looking for engineers because we’ve got more ideas than we have people to build them right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve mentioned, from a research and design perspective, we’re currently working on a considerable product strategy project. We’ve got some ambitious ideas brewing for how we want to improve the product end-to-end. What’s exciting is that it’s all underpinned by the user’s needs rather than just deciding to build X – we’re looking at underlying pain points or jobs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often, the processes and systems behind the research are more broken than they should be. Bringing the stakeholder along for the ride helps give that sense of inclusivity, cementing relationships, and building trust beyond what is ordinarily possible. Dovetail is unique in that researchers and designers build it for themselves. From the junior’s to the CEO, a design ethos and obsession with user experience influences everything. Add that to what is a fantastic period of growth; exciting times ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interview with Cyber-Duck's UX design team]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/interview-with-cyber-ducks-ux-design-team</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/interview-with-cyber-ducks-ux-design-team</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cyber-Duck is a specialist UX design agency that uses empathy and detailed research to inform their projects. Organizations like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyber-duck.co.uk/client-stories/bank-of-england&quot;&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyber-duck.co.uk/client-stories/sport-england&quot;&gt;Sport England&lt;/a&gt; trust &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber-duck.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Cyber-Duck&lt;/a&gt; to transform complex websites, content, and systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail&amp;#39;s Senior UX Designer, Lucy Denton, sat down to chat with Cyber-Duck&amp;#39;s UX designers Meera Rao and Vanessa Strydom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did you get into UX Design?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meera: &lt;/b&gt;Before moving to UX design, we were both in vastly different industries. I was in finance and deal pricing. I&amp;#39;ve always loved problem-solving, and my experience helped me understand how businesses work and what drives them. Vanessa&amp;#39;s background was in the retail sector. Moving into UX Design was the perfect step because she loves finding patterns in human behavior and using her skills to improve people&amp;#39;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does UX design work at Cyber-Duck?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanessa:&lt;/b&gt; As a team, we have a super broad focus and look at user research, prototyping, interaction design, and information architecture. A great example of how UX design works at Cyber-Duck is the project we did with Sport England, encouraging everyone in the UK – regardless of age, background, or ability – to become and stay active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started with an internal review, uncovering that Sport England&amp;#39;s website wasn&amp;#39;t successfully communicating their mission. The site was trying to be all things to all users, so Sport England engaged us to consolidate their digital presence. First off, we immersed ourselves in the brand. We conducted a set of stakeholder interviews and workshops; and validated the audience understanding through user research, analysis, and persona creation. Together with Sport England, we decided the primary audience was B2B (with B2C strategies also assessing the brand, like &amp;#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportengland.org/campaigns-and-our-work/this-girl-can&quot;&gt;This Girl Can&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a content strategy was a critical move because providing information to their audience is an integral part of their purpose. We conducted a content and information architecture audit, enabling us to consolidate multiple sites and reduce the technical and content debt they&amp;#39;d amassed. We used methods like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userzoom.com/blog/what-is-tree-testing-and-why-is-it-important-for-your-sites-ux&quot;&gt;tree-testing&lt;/a&gt; to validate our changes. Once the content and service design strategy was signed off, we took an agile approach and iterated from low-fidelity sketches to UI designs and prototypes. We handed the project over to our development team and kept in touch as the site was built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the website launch, it has gained a 613% increase in traffic, with a 1000% increase in mobile traffic. Our research even helped Sport England respond rapidly to the coronavirus pandemic with its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportengland.org/jointhemovement&quot;&gt;#StayInWorkOut&lt;/a&gt;. You can read all about Cyber-Duck&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyber-duck.co.uk/how-we-work/user-experience&quot;&gt;user-centered design process&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What design challenges are you currently facing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meera:&lt;/b&gt; Our design team is growing, we&amp;#39;re bringing in lots of fresh thinking and ideas that deliver real value. Like everyone else, we&amp;#39;ve made changes to the way we work. We&amp;#39;ve been looking at how we remotely run our design processes without compromising the quality of the work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&amp;#39;s changing about design?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meera: &lt;/b&gt;A lot of our recent client work has been on large-scale government work, which has brought a greater focus on how we consider accessibility and inclusive design in our processes - from user research to coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our recent project with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyber-duck.co.uk/client-stories/cabinet-office&quot;&gt;Cabinet Office&lt;/a&gt;, their Fast Stream and Early Talent program identify leadership potential in the Civil Service candidates. While initially asked to craft a paperless system for their assessment center, the project ended up including a lot more. Informed by user-centered research, we designed an experience that reassured nervous candidates and helped the Cabinet Office to increase their applicants&amp;#39; diversity markedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What tools could you not live without in your design process?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meera and Vanessa: &lt;/b&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t live without a pen and paper, Zoom, Sketch, and Keynote. We&amp;#39;ve recently started using Dovetail and think it&amp;#39;s super useful when analyzing our user interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the best and worst parts of design?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meera:&lt;/b&gt; I&amp;#39;ve had incredible opportunities to grow and learn at Cyber-Duck with each client project bringing its diverse challenges. My supportive team and the independence to think creatively has helped me focus on the genuine value that our work brings to end-users and clients. One of the most constant challenges is working within fast turnarounds while staying user-focused and delivering real value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanessa:&lt;/b&gt; I love that I can experiment and try out new ideas every day. The design process encourages exploration of ideas and test them out. Having a supportive team helps too. In terms of the biggest challenge, the pace of change in technologies and thinking is rapid. Keeping up with trends and improvements is challenging, but this is also what makes it incredibly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice would you give to someone starting in the UX industry?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meera:&lt;/b&gt; Approach it like you would a design project. Do your research, speak to people in the industry, and connect with the folks that design, research, and actually build products. Try to move your focus from the design leaders and the influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get exposure to as many parts of the design spectrum as possible in your initial roles. Jump on opportunities to understand how other related disciplines work like visual design, technology, and project management. Much of the work we do in UX is articulating our ideas and working through challenges with other teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanessa:&lt;/b&gt; My most significant advice is that it&amp;#39;s okay to fail; this is all part of the process. Try out as many ideas as possible, find out which ones work, and which ones don&amp;#39;t-its all part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you have a favorite book, blog, or other resources that have helped you grow in your craft?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meera:&lt;/b&gt; I always look to &lt;a href=&quot;https://abookapart.com&quot;&gt;A Book Apart&lt;/a&gt; for excellent and practical titles. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.com.au/books/invisible-women-9781784706289&quot;&gt;Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez&lt;/a&gt; is not specifically a design book, it&amp;#39;s a riveting read on the data bias built into the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanessa:&lt;/b&gt; A design favorite is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com.au/Dont-Make-Think-Steve-Krug/dp/0321344758&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Make Me Think by Steve Krug&lt;/a&gt;. I would recommend it to any designer, especially those starting in the industry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/20minutesintothefuture/20-minutes-into-the-future-16c2c7334e25&quot;&gt;20 Minutes into the Future&lt;/a&gt; is a newsletter written by Daniel Harvey about how technology shapes our future and how we can use it to improve the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our commitment to performance and reliability]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/our-commitment-to-performance-and-reliability</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/our-commitment-to-performance-and-reliability</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We pride ourselves on the user experience of Dovetail. It&amp;#39;s a value we uphold in every decision we make and it&amp;#39;s one of the many reasons why our customers choose us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know user experience isn&amp;#39;t just visual and interface design – it extends to usability, support, performance, reliability, and much more. Performance, in particular, is a critical part of user experience and shouldn&amp;#39;t be an afterthought. We always consider if what we&amp;#39;re dreaming is possible, given our technical architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve recently received some feedback that the performance, speed, and reliability of Dovetail has degraded, and that it&amp;#39;s affecting the experience of how some customers analyze, collaborate, and share their work. We hear you, and this isn&amp;#39;t the experience we want for anyone using Dovetail – so this is an update to let you know what we&amp;#39;ve done about it and what we will continue to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improving performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, we&amp;#39;ve shipped several incremental changes to improve the performance and reliability of video playback and transcripts in Dovetail. We&amp;#39;ve more than halved the response time of critical interactions, including highlighting and tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve invested in performance monitoring and detection to identify and take proactive measures before affecting customers. We&amp;#39;ve also defined metrics and benchmarks for performance to hold ourselves accountable as we continue to innovate and ship new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind Dovetail is a highly relational data model that allows relationships to be created between disparate pieces of data down to the word level, search across your entire data set in seconds, and allows you to work in real-time with other members of your team. As we add new features and richer relationships between data, we need to continually monitor and sometimes rearchitect portions of our data storage to maintain the level of performance and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/security/&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#39;re striving for. We&amp;#39;ll rinse and repeat until we get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are no silver bullets for improving performance. As a small but growing startup, we&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/roadmap/&quot;&gt;released over 80 features&lt;/a&gt; in just a few years. We&amp;#39;ve focused on building a sustainable business that allows us to continue to invest in improving the impact that research has in organizations worldwide – but engineering speed and product velocity can come at a cost. Degradations in performance are the consequence of many small changes that individually have minimal impact, but cumulatively over time can add up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks and months, you&amp;#39;ll notice Dovetail&amp;#39;s speed and responsiveness improve as we identify opportunities and make changes accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Growing our engineering team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In concert with a focus on improving performance, we are continuing to hire top engineering talent. We&amp;#39;ve been onboarding new engineers who are as passionate and excited about research as we are. It&amp;#39;s been incredible to see the impact they&amp;#39;re already having on some of the most difficult technical elements of the product. We&amp;#39;re excited to have a full-time technical recruiter join us who&amp;#39;s focus will be growing our engineering team to help us realize our ambitious vision of building the best product for researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you, or anyone you know, is interested in shaping a technically challenging product that is revolutionizing how organizations make customer-informed decisions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/careers/&quot;&gt;please apply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing our engineering team will allow us to parallelize more work, continue to execute on feature requests and product innovations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;video highlights and transcription&lt;/a&gt;, while progressing the important unseen work that keeps Dovetail reliable, fast, and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re wholeheartedly committed to building the best product for researchers.

For example, it&amp;#39;s nice to add additional context to explain why you used a certain tag, or to note your observations. Often you&amp;#39;ll want to call attention to an interesting part of your research and bring others into the conversation. When giving feedback on a research plan, it&amp;#39;s helpful to discuss specific aspects of the plan, or have a conversation about a particular insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today, we&amp;#39;ve introduced &lt;b&gt;inline comments&lt;/b&gt; across Dovetail. Simply select any text in a note, tag, insight, or in the project readme, and start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Discuss and plan your research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your research right. Use inline comments in the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/project-readme/&quot;&gt;project readme&lt;/a&gt; to align on your research goals, discussion, guide, participant requirements, and more. Collaboratively discuss, action, and converge on project requirements with your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add context to your highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inline comments helps you add additional context and notes from your observations, while analyzing your data. This can be useful for others collaborating on your research. For example, clarify what a research participant was saying, why you tagged a sentence with a particular tag, or simply add a note to yourself for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pull your teammates into the conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe research is meant to be shared. Use &lt;b&gt;@mentions&lt;/b&gt; to share research with others, bring them into the conversation, and draw attention to key moments. Anyone you &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/the-basics/comments/&quot;&gt;mention in a comment&lt;/a&gt; will get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/organize-your-data/project-notifications/&quot;&gt;email notification&lt;/a&gt; with a deep link to the comment thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that inline comments helps you and your team collaborate on research more effectively.

They&amp;#39;re not the only ones in the organization speaking to people–product managers, designers, customer success, marketing, and sales frequently chat with users and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can find this challenging because it’s hard to determine if other departments ask unbiased questions and capture useful data. It can be daunting to figure out what questions will result in relevant insights that’ll later be leveraged for better research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more people who understand research techniques, the more data can be added into the pipeline and leveraged when generating insights. This prospect makes it incredibly important to educate stakeholders on how to best conduct research sessions and capture the correct data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common way stakeholders will research is by conducting an in-depth interview. Although having a conversation with someone may seem reasonably straightforward, leveraging tested research techniques maximizes the output and potential for insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Build rapport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building rapport is essential when connecting with customers, especially when you want them to open up to you on tough topics. The same way you wouldn’t share your innermost secrets on a first date, building rapport takes time. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that participants won’t share their real thoughts with you immediately if you’ve never spoken to them before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structure your interview into four question segments - human, fact, opinion, and open-ended. The goal of the first half is to build rapport. Ensuring you have built trust means that customers will provide honest answers and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Human questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set of questions is to get to know the participant as a human. You might ask them about how their day is going or to shed light on their role. These questions should be easy to answer and help break the ice. You might also use this time to share more about you, your background, and why you’re talking in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Fact questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fact-based questions are where there is a clear and indisputable answer, and help make the participant feel more comfortable with the conversation. You can begin to set the context of what you’d like to hear from the participant, such as their usage with a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Opinion questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re now able to start asking the participant for their opinion, pain points, or frustrations with products or experiences. They will generally provide more insight because of the context you’ve set in your previous questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Open-ended questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep it open, so your participant can share their perspective or opinions on anything that you may not have covered as part of your question set, but they trust sharing with you. Ensure you keep enough time for this as there is often something unexpected that the participant shares that may lead to new insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Always be closing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to interview questions, there are open questions (those with free-form answers) and closed questions (those with a yes or no response).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You generally funnel from open to closed questions on the various topics. Be careful not to start with closed or leading questions as it can bias participants’ answers towards your assumptions. The way you move from open to closed questioning is through three stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;discovering &lt;/b&gt;stage is where you ask open-ended questions, opening up the possibility for a range of answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;validating &lt;/b&gt;stage is where you ask probing or clarifying questions related to the previous responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;paraphrasing &lt;/b&gt;stage is where you repeat the answer back to the participant to make sure you have a common understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach ensures you can diverge on a focus area, then converge on a specific response, and then verify that you have a shared understanding with the participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don’t assume&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most critical traits of a researcher is the ability to build empathy for your participant. Having compassion helps you walk in someone else’s shoes by creating a shared understanding of your experiences, feelings, perspective, and needs. To truly build empathy for another person, you need to challenge your assumptions and biases because your participant’s context will be different from your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to help challenge your assumptions is by asking why—a lot. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playbookux.com/five-whys/&quot;&gt;five whys&lt;/a&gt; capture more context about the responses and curiously looking for the deeper why helps you either prove or disprove your assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Listen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active listening is when you are engaged, present, and responding to your participant. Hearing what the participant is telling you is not just listening to what they say. You must consider what you are thinking, doing, and saying throughout the interview:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think&lt;/b&gt;: When you’re thinking - be curious. If something is worth digging into, don’t feel that you have to stick to your script, adapt and change based on what you’re hearing. Remember, you’re having a conversation, and opening that up might enable you to find some unexpected insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do&lt;/b&gt;: Watch what you’re doing and monitor your body language - are you leaning in, are your arms crossed, and do you look interested? Being open and engaged will make your participant more receptive to having a conversation. Additionally, consider cultural norms and how this may factor into how you have a chat, especially if your participant comes from a different culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Say&lt;/b&gt;: When you’re responding or leading in the conversation, use paraphrasing to confirm your understanding (closing your questions) and make sure you’re exploring the problems in the solutions your participants are identifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast?registration=success&quot;&gt;Henry Ford* wanted to innovate beyond faster horses&lt;/a&gt;, many participants will try to solutionize their problems based on their context and assumptions. Rather than taking their solution at face value, it’s important to drill into the underlying pain point. You can do this by using the five whys technique to understand why a specific solution is so important to them and what problem it is solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Find patterns in insights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost count of the number of times people have wanted to make product changes based on a single customer conversation. Instead, you should have multiple discussions with various customers to help you identify the commonalities and differences that will help you build once to serve many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of conversations needed to build confidence primarily depends on the type of methodology used and the number of different research segments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/&quot;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group suggests testing with five users in conversations with a usability focus&lt;/a&gt;. For more exploratory research, you should try to aim for eight to 10 participants per segment, as this will help you identify strong patterns between your participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is incredibly important to set expectations with your stakeholders on who you chose to include and exclude in the interview phase. Indicating that you have complete coverage over your user base while only talking customers from a single industry can bias the findings you present to your stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying patterns in your findings is crucial to capture insights and genuinely understand customers through their behaviors and attitudes. As you capture your insights, you should consider what is behavioral (i.e., what they do) and what is attitudinal (i.e., what they say).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful about what people say they do, as this is an attitudinal perspective instead of a true behavioral reflection. Margaret Mead said it best:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What people say, what people do and what they say they do are entirely different things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educating stakeholders on how to run their research can hurt a researcher’s output in the short term, but the value gained is in the potential for increased data capturing, which ultimately increases the number of available insights. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best platforms for recruiting user research participants]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/the-best-platforms-for-recruiting-user-research-participants</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/the-best-platforms-for-recruiting-user-research-participants</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#39;ve discussed in our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/recruiting-participants-user-research&quot;&gt;tips for recruiting participants for user research&lt;/a&gt;, recruiting people to participate in user research is often one of the most challenging and underestimated parts of conducting research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that you can go about sourcing participants. You could email your customers, post on social media, ask friends and family, run advertisements on social media, or even ask people on the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficulty is that you need to do the hard work to screen your participants to make sure they&amp;#39;re a good fit for your research, work out availability and scheduling for them to participate, and finally handle the logistics of paying an incentive to the participant for their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently a number of companies have set out to do all this hard work for you. They&amp;#39;ve built a network of participants ready and willing to contribute to your research, and have developed tools to manage scheduling and payment of incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve compiled a list of the leading platforms that researchers are using and each of their strengths. All of these platforms help with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding and recruiting research subjects:&lt;/b&gt; Finding participants and screening them based on your criteria from their own network of participants that they&amp;#39;ve built up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scheduling participant time in calendars:&lt;/b&gt; Allowing participants to schedule time based on your researcher&amp;#39;s availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paying and delivering incentives:&lt;/b&gt; Arranging payment and delivery of incentives to those who attend your research, usually in the form of gift cards or cash disbursements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://respondent.io&quot;&gt;Respondent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://respondent.io&quot;&gt;Respondent&lt;/a&gt; has developed a network of professionals, including software developers, marketers, enterprise software users, and other knowledge workers. Unlike other recruitment platforms with a lot of consumer participants, Respondent is especially effective when you need to recruit business professionals for your research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondent is great for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourcing &lt;b&gt;business professionals&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;knowledge workers&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting participants for &lt;b&gt;B2B research&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourcing participants for &lt;b&gt;any research method&lt;/b&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/generative-evaluative-research/&quot;&gt;generative and evaluative research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://askable.com&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Askable&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://askable.com&quot;&gt;Askable&lt;/a&gt; is an Australian-based company that recruits worldwide.

Researchers are generally responsible for collecting, organizing, and analyzing opinions (qualitative) and data (quantitative) to solve problems, explore issues, and predict trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will generally fall into two broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Academic Research:&lt;/b&gt; Focuses more on an in-depth investigation into a specific topic or domain to create a new perspective to contribute to the more extensive knowledge base on that topic. The timeline for delivery is not a critical dependency as the rigor and quality of findings are more important in the output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industry / Professional Research:&lt;/b&gt; focuses more on finding answers to enable organizations to make decisions in their strategy or products. Timelines and stakeholders are critically important for professional research to ensure that findings are understood and applied to the product or strategy investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many academic researchers will look to transition to professional research roles at organizations after they have completed their studies, usually called &amp;quot;moving to industry.&amp;quot; However, some academic researchers struggle with this transition. They have to move from the depth and rigor they are used to an approach where there is an expectation of being faster and create findings that make sense to those from non-research backgrounds (such as product managers, designers, or executives).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every researcher is unique. They all will have different experiences and specializations. Although someone may call themselves a &amp;#39;researcher,&amp;#39; they may have a more specialized set of research skills, so it&amp;#39;s essential to understand &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; type of researcher – or research – you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many of these skills overlap, you may find that a researcher will have expertise across different research types or approaches. Outside of academic and professional researchers, some of the researcher types you may come across:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User / UX / Design Researcher:&lt;/b&gt; Focuses on understanding users&amp;#39; characteristics, goals, behaviors and experience towards achieving these goals. Research will generally be in service of an experience or interface, but it may be to help drive strategy or business decisions in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usability Researcher:&lt;/b&gt; Focuses on evaluative research to determine how a UI meets or doesn&amp;#39;t meet the user&amp;#39;s objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Researcher:&lt;/b&gt; Focuses on assessing a product or service (e.g., will someone buy a particular product?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advertising Effectiveness Researcher:&lt;/b&gt; A specialized form of market research that aims to discover which ads will be most effective with the existing and potential customer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers may also describe themselves by the type of methodologies they generally use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualitative Researcher: &lt;/b&gt;Generally runs research methodologies that focus on context and observations rather than numerical data or statistics. Research outputs usually are attitudinal (i.e. what people say). Most likely will work with smaller sample sizes. Standard methodologies are interviews, contextual inquiry (or ethnography), and usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative Researcher:&lt;/b&gt; Generally runs research methodologies that focus on numerical data and statistics. Research outputs are generally behavioral (i.e. what people do). Most likely will work with larger sample sizes. Standard methodologies are surveys or analytics analysis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mixed Methods Researcher:&lt;/b&gt; Someone who does both. True mixed method researchers are tough to find; generally, if a researcher calls themselves mixed methods, they have a preference or more experience in quantitative or qualitative research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional researchers also may have a different mindset of how they research based on their role:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;#39;In House&amp;#39; research.&lt;/b&gt; Based within a company and are embedded with stakeholders across various functions. There isn&amp;#39;t a logical place where research fits within an org chart, but it generally will be based on design, product, or marketing. They are responsible for partnering with stakeholders to advocate for the customer in their products on an iterative basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once research is complete, they will work across the product development lifecycle to leverage findings. Once a product or feature has been launched, they will take the learnings and incorporate it into future research projects to track work on a quarterly or half-yearly basis in alignment with broader product roadmaps. They are preferred for &lt;b&gt;depth of experience&lt;/b&gt; within the product process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agency or consulting research.&lt;/b&gt; A separate company who will provide research services to another organization. These researchers are generally preferred to provide a completely independent perspective or not be bogged down by the client&amp;#39;s organization&amp;#39;s politics. These researchers will typically come in with a project scope for &amp;quot;discovery&amp;quot; work. Once the project is complete, the researcher stops working with the organization unless additional projects are available. These researchers are hired for their &lt;b&gt;breadth of experience&lt;/b&gt; across industries or customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these nuances will help you have more meaningful conversations with the researchers you work with, and ensure you can partner with them in the most effective way possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The ultimate list of UX and user research podcasts]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/list-ux-research-podcasts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/list-ux-research-podcasts</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Podcasts allow people to take advantage of their downtime and engage in some thought-provoking audio.

Effective customer-focused organizations can make strategic research-driven decisions every day, but others struggle to get their research noticed and actioned by decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional research process often converts user research data into insights that are presented and stored in reports. Both the report and the raw information that guided these insights – spreadsheets, videos, audio files, transcripts, PDFs – are then often lost in an abyss of files and folders or sit within one siloed part of the organization. This means valuable research is lost or out of sight, causing businesses to become trapped in a vicious cycle of repeating research and learning the same things over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is atomic research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/the-atomic-unit-of-a-research-insight-7bf13ec8fabe&quot;&gt;Developed by the then Head of UX at WeWork, Tomer Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, and his team, this approach breaks down research insights into an atomic unit called a ‘nugget’. In Tomer’s own words in his 2018 article &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/foundations-of-atomic-research-a937d5da5fbb&quot;&gt;Foundations of atomic research&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atomic Research is an approach to managing research knowledge that redefines the atomic unit of a research insight. Instead of reports, slide decks, and dashboards, the new atomic unit of a research insight is a nugget. A nugget is a tagged observation supported by evidence. It’s a single-experience insight about a customer’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently chatted with Tomer to thoroughly understand the why behind atomic research. He told us that the primary argument for atomic research was to mitigate bad research memory (the loss of organizational knowledge over time), research silos (no real knowledge and connection between insights learned across the organization), and lengthy research reports that no one reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a nugget?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/the-atomic-unit-of-a-research-insight-7bf13ec8fabe&quot;&gt;nugget&lt;/a&gt; exists as a point of searchable and shareable raw &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-quantitative-research&quot;&gt;qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; on customer experience, backed by evidence. The following structure helps understand what goes into a nugget and the general concept:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation &lt;/b&gt;– an explanation of what the researcher learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomer highlighted that an observation must include both the what and why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of the why makes it a high-quality insight, for example: The what is that a WeWork member prefers to bring their own printer rather than use WeWork’s printing services. Adding the why, because they found our process for using printing services impossible to navigate, is what makes it an insight rather than a useless fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evidence &lt;/b&gt;– material that supports the observation, such as video recordings, audio, photos, or screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tags &lt;/b&gt;– a taxonomy that captures information, including research methodology, business structure, demographics, experience, or where the nugget appears within the user journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual nuggets are tagged so that anyone can analyze information from different sources to identify and track patterns that emerge in context. Think of a wall covered in color-coded post-it notes, each one capturing a modified excerpt from a series of customer interviews. Now digitize it. The point was that anyone, not just researchers, can do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, atomic research allows for the identification and tracking of insights that stand on their own but can be brought together to paint a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuggets can be extracted from a variety of sources, commonly those that are qualitative in nature, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;video interviews&lt;/a&gt;. You then allocate each nugget to a series of tags / fields to classify and assist with the tracking process for easy searchability. Tags and fields can be procedural (date, source, evidence media type), demographic (age, gender, location), experience-oriented (magnitude, frequency, emotions), business-oriented (revenue range, business unit, product line), or service design-oriented (journey, act, scene, character).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations are then able to build up a library of atomic insights, potentially into a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/user-ux-research-repository&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt;, that allows researchers to identify and monitor trends such moments of pain or delight through the customer journey. This creates a single source of truth about user experience that can be transformed into insights, tested, and retested to guide business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomer highlighted an important distinction that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research repository isn’t always a library of atomic insights. Many organizations have research repositories that are, in fact, a repository of reports rather than a repository of atomic insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Atomic research in action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Research at your fingertips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research repository allows organizations to catalog their customer research in an easy-to-navigate centralized digital filing system. They can be accessed by researchers, product designers, product managers, marketers, and other functions across the business. Team members can search for and analyze relevant data by tags, replacing the manual process of trawling through years of archived reports and files siloed throughout an organization. New nuggets can be continually added to the research repository, building a central hub of valuable user research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When paired with a research repository, the atomic model transforms user research into a responsive knowledge ecosystem that continues to build upon itself. When past facts and insights can be easily rediscovered, knowledge can become evergreen — no research is forgotten, and no relevant research goes to waste. All facts and insights continue to add value long after the experiment has concluded. Tomer added that research itself must change for atomic research to work well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/continuous-user-research-in-11-6-seconds-57c27d1595c5&quot;&gt;Continuous research&lt;/a&gt; is research that happens all the time and is very open-ended in nature, ultimately powering the repository with a variety of insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remove personal bias&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on which function within an organization is leading a user research project, you can frame the resulting insights to draw conclusions relevant to that team. Product managers may be looking for a particular truth pertinent to their product domain. In contrast, designers or marketers may be able to lift another from the same pool of research. Atomic research removes personal bias by breaking down and storing qualitative data in a more raw form that ensures a shared understanding across stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atomic research is a force multiplier. Insights are treated as stand-alone entities and aren’t bound to the context of their original experiment. Meaning you can discover patterns across multiple experiments within large organizations. Past insights and conclusions can be validated and bolstered by current research, keeping institutional knowledge relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Connecting atomic units&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s important here are the connections made between the atomic units — facts, insights, and conclusions. Connections combine facts and insights to strengthen and validate a decision. This approach to user research helps prioritize a team’s workload by focusing on real knowledge gaps and amplifying the value of individual initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning about creating WeWork’s Polaris research repository in Dovetail, check &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/polaris-research-repository-dovetail/&quot;&gt;out our blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research collection and analysis when everyone’s remote]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/collection-analysis-remote-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/collection-analysis-remote-research</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Remote user research is an approach to conducting research where the researcher facilitates participants online using technology such as video conferencing, digital surveys, online usability testing software, and digital analysis tools. Researchers are now, more than ever, looking to leverage remote research approaches to ensure they provide meaningful insights to their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are some limitations of remote research, there are also many benefits. Unlike traditional approaches where a researcher may facilitate research in-person, in a lab, or focus group, conducting research remotely can be significantly faster, more reliable, and scalable. It can reduce the time it takes to get to actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performing research remotely can also make it easier to recruit participants as you’re not constrained by location, in-person scheduling, or equipment. Similarly, remote research enables researchers to observe and collect feedback from participants in their own environment or using their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve broken down remote research into two parts – the &lt;b&gt;collection&lt;/b&gt; phase where you conduct user research digitally using various tools, and the &lt;b&gt;analysis&lt;/b&gt; phase, which includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.process.st/virtual-team/&quot;&gt;remote collaboration&lt;/a&gt; and analysis of the data you’ve collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collection phase&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in-person research is excellent for building a human connection, remotely conducting your research collection has many benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking distance out of the equation. &lt;/b&gt;Remotely-conducted user studies allow you to connect with subjects anywhere in the world. Because you’re not restricted by location, you have access to a larger pool of participants. This is particularly useful if you have recruiting criteria for niche topics, enabling you to recruit a more diverse sample set to meet this need. Ultimately, this means that your research can be based on a more generalizable sample of people, not just the people that were able to come to the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-vinh/&quot;&gt;James Vinh&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sdxd.org/&quot;&gt;SDXD&lt;/a&gt; (San Diego Experience Design) community, indicated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nimble nature of remote research has fostered increased inclusivity and accessibility for our research participants; it enables us to overcome typical geographical barriers to connect with a broader range of user types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeping costs down. &lt;/b&gt;Because participants use their own equipment in their own environments, remote research lowers the cost of structured interviews and usability testing. It also helps you reduce the amount of time you spend setting up and facilitating in-person tests in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engaging participants who are more at ease online. &lt;/b&gt;Face-to-face testing requires researchers to be in the room, and that can prove distracting or pressurizing to subjects and can influence their responses. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/hidden-benefits-remote-research/&quot;&gt;Remote participants can be more focused and honest in their feedback&lt;/a&gt; compared to subjects performing tests in-person. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu_Sun_Bin/publication/51750501_Comparing_Online_and_Offline_Self-Disclosure_A_Systematic_Review/links/0fcfd506a4f4bd71ae000000/Comparing-Online-and-Offline-Self-Disclosure-A-Systematic-Review.pdf&quot;&gt;Conducting research remotely can make people share more information&lt;/a&gt;, especially when the topic is sensitive. Researchers have historically favored in-person research because it enables them to quickly build rapport with participants and get a sense of non-verbal cues in a conversation. If you’re running remote research, make sure you spend the time creating this rapport virtually and figuring out other ways to gauge non-verbal perceptions, such as ensuring the video is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chmccurrie/&quot;&gt;Caitlin McCurrie&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Design Researcher at MYOB, chats about how remote research can also accelerate turnaround:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;​​Conducting interviews remotely means you can schedule more sessions in your day. There is also no need to waste time setting up, traveling, and a reduced risk of no shows. Finding the right participants can also be much faster when you remove your geographic limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remotely conducting research can be a blessing to research teams that need a fast, cost-effective, and scalable way to get insights. But of course, every business is unique, and the way you drive your research initiatives could differ vastly from the rest. Luckily, there are a bunch of varied methodologies and technologies you can use to help develop an effective remote research practice in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remote user interviews&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviews are one of the most common remote research methods. Here are a few tips to consider before you get started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interview using video calling software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://hangouts.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/a&gt;. Most platforms offer screen-sharing, so you can follow how a participant uses a SaaS product, for example, and ask questions along the way. You could also share your screen and adapt workshop activities to run remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you hit record so you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;transcribe your interview&lt;/a&gt; with a tool like Dovetail, which quickly beats scrubbing back and forth on playable files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember to store your recorded videos and transcriptions in your &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt; to effortlessly find specific insights later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remote usability testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remotely facilitating a usability test differs from doing it traditionally because you’re not in the same room as the participant. And regardless of whether the test is conducted in-person or remotely, it can either be &lt;b&gt;moderated&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;unmoderated&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Moderated sessions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A facilitator is present, allowing interaction with the participant, so both can ask questions or talk through any issues instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same problems that exist in face-to-face studies can become amplified in remote usability tests. This could be that participants might feel awkward being watched over, and facilitators might struggle to find a balance between letting users know they are there to help and distracting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unmoderated sessions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A participant tests alone, meaning that researchers may need to be more upfront with participants to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/&quot;&gt;think-aloud protocol&lt;/a&gt; and carefully put the questions together because they don’t have the opportunity to ask follow-ups. On the plus side, you’re more likely to get insights quicker as participants can take tests in their own time instead of fitting into a set schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.io/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt; (for working products) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://maze.design/&quot;&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; (for designs) can take the headache out of remote usability testing by allowing you to share task details with your participants and record their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remote diary studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote diary studies are a great way of conducting longitudinal research, especially if you’re after data on behaviors or actions that happen sporadically, or if your research falls under a level of sensitivity that would not work well under direct observation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital diaries can be set up in several tools. Cloud-based file sharing and live collaboration tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/forms/about/&quot;&gt;Google Forms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.au/sheets/about/&quot;&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt; are great to keep information up-to-date and organized. Then there are platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://indeemo.com/&quot;&gt;Indeemo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dscout.com/&quot;&gt;dscout&lt;/a&gt; that enable diary updates on the go to include videos, photos, and audio to help understand a participant’s context and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recruiting remote users for your studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remotely conducting research gives you access to a larger pool of participants, which could be advantageous when looking for a specific set of requirements. Here are a couple of tools that’ll help you find remote participants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userinterviews.com/&quot;&gt;User Interviews&lt;/a&gt; lets you review profiles and accept or reject participants who have qualified for your research needs. They also handle things like scheduling and incentive payments so you can focus on what’s important – the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userzoom.com/&quot;&gt;UserZoom&lt;/a&gt; sources participants through an independent engine, or lets you manage the sourcing through several channels such as QR codes and emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chmccurrie/&quot;&gt;Caitlin McCurrie&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Design Researcher at MYOB, added the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.askable.com/product-select&quot;&gt;Askable&lt;/a&gt; gives you control over pre-screening participants of their extensive panel and run studies directly on their platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are running unmoderated research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prolific.co/&quot;&gt;Prolific&lt;/a&gt;, is a great and economic platform to consider. Typically used for academic research, participants are pre-screened extensively, and a minimum wage is set to ensure ethical payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Analysis phase&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a massive war room or synthesis wall to analyze your research data. In fact, sometimes, it’s easier to analyze your research and produce actionable insights remotely. Some reasons include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collaboration can be digital. &lt;/b&gt;If everyone has to be in the same physical location at the same time, you may never be able to get the full team together. Managing the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/collaborative-analysis-research-stakeholders/&quot;&gt;collaborative analysis&lt;/a&gt; phase as a remote team means everyone can be involved, speeding up the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your research repository can be universally digitized. &lt;/b&gt;Using a digital-first approach makes it easier to build a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt; that can reach the entire organization regardless of timezones and locations. Doing so will significantly accelerate your organization’s journey to creating a living library of insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can build relationships directly. &lt;/b&gt;Often, research teams hear things second-hand because the in-person research has already taken place, and they only get to see the findings. Remote research allows you to use tech that lets your users speak for themselves, for example, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;videos that drive action from your team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improve the quality of your research. &lt;/b&gt;Despite how careful we can be as researchers in our analysis, many minds are better than one. By introducing many people into the analysis phase, each can bring their own frame of reference and interpretation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital analysis also reduces the barrier to entry for your colleagues to peer review your tag taxonomy during analysis, helps you build a shared language to describe the research insights, and makes it more accessible to get everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Turn silos into teams&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, when physical barriers are removed, departments that were once siloed can collaborate with greater ease online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s Product Designer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-denton-4b6b8059/&quot;&gt;Lucy Denton&lt;/a&gt;, reflected on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/collaborative-analysis-research-stakeholders/&quot;&gt;a few methods&lt;/a&gt; she used in her previous role at Atlassian for analyzing and synthesizing research data as a team:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use digital affinity mapping &lt;/b&gt;to organize and cluster ideas and to ideate on UX strategy and vision to understand problems and solutions. There are various tools on the market that allow for the digitization of this process, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/templates/affinity-diagram/&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt;, an online collaborative whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source opinions and advice from subject matter experts &lt;/b&gt;that aren’t always privy to the analysis stage. By bringing design, engineering, marketing, and sales together into one cross-functional research team, you’ll get better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While remote research changes things, it’s not all bad news. Being remote has its upsides, and with more online collection and analysis tools than ever before, it’s never been a better time to be conducting your research remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Caitlin McCurrie, Ph.D., Lead Researcher, Atlassian and James Vinh, President, San Diego Experience Design Professionals. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Matter approaches research and design]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/interview-matter</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/interview-matter</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matterapp.com/&quot;&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is a professional feedback platform based out of San Francisco. They are building the next-generation app for professionals, teams, and organizations to empower growth and personal betterment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matter’s research and design team is made up of a researcher, two designers, and a product manager. We spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcreisen/&quot;&gt;Marc Reisen&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Design, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescagabales/&quot;&gt;Francesca Gabales&lt;/a&gt;, Design Strategist and Researcher to learn about how they approach research and design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Matter’s mission?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matter, founded in 2017 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretthellman/&quot;&gt;Brett Hellman&lt;/a&gt;, was born out of the pain that most people experience during annual review cycles. Existing tools for feedback are complicated, confusing, and cumbersome - but Matter is different. Matter makes feedback productive, positive, and pleasant. Our mission is to change the whole way you approach getting feedback and to put you in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does research and design work at Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that we are a feedback product, it won’t surprise you that Matter is customer-obsessed. We try to ‘sit down and chat’ with at least five customers a week for qualitative in-depth interviews (IDIs). Every conversation has a purpose and looks at solving a specific problem statement that impacts our product. The whole team is invited to join these IDIs because we know that, regardless of whether you are in engineering or marketing, having a pulse on customers’ needs and expectations benefits everyone collectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What challenges do you have with research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A challenge with qualitative research is that customers are very eager to put on their design hats and request a wide spectrum of features and functionalities. As a design team, we make a concerted effort to probe for the root cause of these asks before we build out conclusions. Thinking through this lens allows us to be data-informed, but not drive every decision solely based on raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How has research and design evolved for Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, our design team was just Marc Reisen, our Head of Design. Due to the time needed for research, qualitative efforts were reserved for larger projects during the initial stages of the design and development process. In 2019, Matter grew from a team of four to a team of 11. With that growth, Matter has been able to decentralize research and design through the hiring of a dedicated researcher and a product designer. This evolution has allowed Matter to work at a faster velocity in creating new features, while also dedicating time to iterate on existing features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does Dovetail fit into your process?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All customer feedback is fed through to Dovetail. We import data from our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/net-promoter-score-nps/&quot;&gt;NPS&lt;/a&gt; tool, enter transcripts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/use-cases/customer-interview-analysis/&quot;&gt;customer qualitative interviews&lt;/a&gt;, and log customer support conversations. The data is then tagged with common themes - some of these themes are project-specific, whereas others apply to a more global experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s workspace tags allow us to compartmentalize themes and merge similar ones together. Once the themes have been solidified, write-ups are created through Dovetail’s insights, and then these insights are shared with the broader company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding product-market fit is about building the right thing for the right customer. When a company opens itself up to user feedback, it is easy to get inundated with data. Dovetail helps Matter sift through the noise, and ensures that unstructured data from various sources can be tagged and categorized into meaningful insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does your tooling look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail has been our core research tool since Matter was founded. Dovetail was first introduced by Marc, our Head of Design, in an effort to find common themes within various customer inputs and is now managed by Francesca Gabales, our Design Strategist and Researcher. Dovetail is our source of truth for qualitative customer data – from raw customer transcripts, tagging structures, and customer insights. Through these insights, our product manager creates product requirement documents (PRDs) inside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to design work via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;. Dovetail, along with Notion and Figma, helps make research and design collaborative and simple.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating WeWork’s Polaris research repository in Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/polaris-research-repository-dovetail</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/polaris-research-repository-dovetail</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomersharon/&quot;&gt;Tomer Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, the then Head of User Experience at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wework.com/&quot;&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;, in his article &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f&quot;&gt;Democratizing UX&lt;/a&gt; shared a look into Polaris – the research repository that his team had built in-house to help WeWork make better decisions informed by UX research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt; is a central place, or source of truth, where people in your organization can go to find the latest insights from your research team. Research repositories help to democratize research and empower all teams to leverage customer research in their day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomer also gave a talk about Polaris at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lxconference.com/&quot;&gt;Leading Experience 2017 conference&lt;/a&gt; where he walked through a detailed demo of how Polaris works inside of WeWork. You can watch it here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his talk, he introduces the concept of a &lt;b&gt;research nugget&lt;/b&gt; – a tagged observation supported by evidence – that comprises of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation &lt;/b&gt;– an explanation of what the researcher observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evidence &lt;/b&gt;– material that supports the observation, such as recordings, audio, photos, quotes, or screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tags &lt;/b&gt;– a taxonomy that captures demographic information about the participant, or that relates to functions in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These nuggets are entered into WeWork’s research repository: Polaris. Nuggets entered into Polaris are accessible by anyone in the organization through search, and filtered by dimensions like location and company size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Polaris demo, Tomer showcases that these nuggets are curated into playlists, allowing anyone to engage with the research findings that relate to a specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video and audio recordings are entered into Polaris as nuggets, which can be played back and allow you to listen to customers talk about the exact topic you’ve searched for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating a repository in Dovetail like Polaris&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Polaris is an internal tool that was never made publicly available, many researchers have used Dovetail to create a research repository that’s informed by the observation, evidence, and tags principles that make up a research nugget in Polaris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, an insight can be created for each finding from your research. Similar to playlists in Polaris, each insight typically includes a summary, written by the researcher, with a collection of individual &lt;b&gt;observations&lt;/b&gt; and references to &lt;b&gt;evidence&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might arrive at multiple insights for each research project you conduct. Insights might be findings that relate directly to the goals of your research, or they could be other interesting but unrelated observations that you uncovered through your research. Here’s an example of an insight in Dovetail:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each insight, &lt;b&gt;evidence&lt;/b&gt; can be referenced from any highlights or tags that you’ve created in Dovetail. This evidence might be specific quotes that you’ve tagged or notes you’ve recorded from customer interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have video recordings of interviews or meetings, these can be uploaded to Dovetail and transcribed. When you reference a highlight from a video recording, only the exact excerpt of the person mentioning your highlight will be included in your insight. Here’s an example of an insight with a reference to a highlight that’s been tagged:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every insight, each reference can be clicked through to see the full context from the original research data – enabling you to dive into the details and understand where exactly a quote came from, or learn more about the demographic information of the research subject. Here’s an example of the full video recording and transcript, along with participant information like name, role, company size, and more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve started to create more insights in Dovetail, your team and the wider organization can search for new insights to inform the work that they’re doing. Similar to Polaris, insights can be filtered by fields and other dimensions to narrow down insights that might only relate to specific departments, features, segments, or anything you else you define. Here’s an example of what searching for insights looks like in Dovetail:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in applying research nuggets to your practice, or starting a Polaris-style research repository within your organization, you can get started with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/auth/signup/&quot;&gt;free trial of Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Q&A with Matt Duignan from Microsoft’s Human Insight System]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/microsoft-hits-question-answer-matt-duignan</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/microsoft-hits-question-answer-matt-duignan</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosenfeldmedia.com/advancing-research-2020/&quot;&gt;Advancing Research 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Principal User Research Manager of Microsoft’s Human Insight System, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-duignan-89493932/&quot;&gt;Matt Duignan&lt;/a&gt; hosted a session in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; lounge and opened up the floor for Q&amp;amp;A. Matt saw this time as a good opportunity to talk about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-microsofts-human-insights-library-creates-a-living-body-of-knowledge-fff54e53f5ec&quot;&gt;Microsoft have done with HITS&lt;/a&gt; and discuss other’s experiences in the space of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/the-atomic-unit-of-a-research-insight-7bf13ec8fabe&quot;&gt;atomized insights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/2020/ux-australia-design-research-2020/&quot;&gt;insight repositories&lt;/a&gt;. Below is a condensed version of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting leadership buy-in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you talk about the role of leadership in supporting HITS? Who had to be sold, how high up, and how has that morphed over time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a fascinating story and I think anyone who’s in a situation where they want to develop an ambitious project, whether it’s for knowledge management or otherwise, it can end up being tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HITS came to be because it involved a research leader in a position of enough vision, authority, and with enough budget to be able to make it happen. In our case, we had a pretty large centralized research team of about 50 researchers and additional research support on top of that. This enabled us to focus on doing something interesting and pursuing a larger, more strategic initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it would be very hard to do something like HITS from scratch if you didn’t have a center of gravity of research. HITS was born in a context where all of the research groups had been organized together into one central group for all of the different operating systems. At the time, we needed to figure out how to scale knowledge across these different research and product domains. We found that there can be a lot of back and forth trying to get permission and funding to do something, so instead, we ended up bootstrapping it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started to create something to make sure we had a proof of concept that we could show to leadership. Once they could see the early primitive version of that, they got excited and started investing in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Managing stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you measure the impact of a research repository on development teams? I have trouble getting stakeholders to read my research even in the TL;DR nuggets. I’m not sure how our repository will help improve this with groups that don’t want to read. What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have teams who have a culture of not reading, it’s fundamentally hard to feel valued unless you can figure out how to change the culture which is notoriously challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your organization size, I will say that there is value in collecting the information for your own reuse. It’s worth doing if you have multiple researchers in a space or researchers who are across different parts of an organization who might share knowledge between them. You can then build from there and explore whether there are non-researchers who might get value out of this and figure out how to pull them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When talking about measuring the impact, we have pretty good analytics so we can see whether people are reading stuff or linking to pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the big metrics we’re trying to drive is whether people are coming to the front page and running a search or coming to one of our topical product pages in HITS. What we’re trying to do is create a self-serve organic behavior in our stakeholders and we can measure that and look at that behavior changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other part is how can the platform integrate with the workflow and tools that your product teams are using. In terms of filing bugs or work items, how do you connect with those tools that they’re using and how can you use your research knowledge systems as a way to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last part I’d add is - it helps if there is a leader in the organization who’s creating some pressure for people to either be consuming or linking to the research. If there’s a leader in the organization who says something around not wanting to see any proposals for new features without links to good research. Something as simple as that can create a habit where non-researchers are incentivized to show the research behind, or justify, why they’re making a decision. The impact this can have is, all of a sudden your research knowledge management tool is an asset to them and solving a problem that they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding what makes a good insight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One concern that comes up as we discuss research repositories is controlling the quality of the original observation. How much gatekeeping is there in the creation of observations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used to have gatekeeping down to the level of enforcing the way the observations were written to make sure that they could stand alone because that was part of the quality of this atomized system. We had guidelines around how to structure things and we had a lot of review. I think generally we’ve moved away from that and our principle gatekeeping is figuring out who has access to author. At the moment it’s only trained research and data science teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to enforce quality is to trust the individual teams. A lot of it comes down to the fact that some people won’t have trust in the system, so they refer to the researcher associated with the research. They look at whether they know the person or the team associated with it - coming down to more of a brand consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found it was untenable to do hardcore quality control on an insight-by-insight or observation-by-observation basis. I can talk a lot about durable insights, we did create an entire system for peer-review of durable insights. For something to be branded durable, it would have to go through a company-wide peer-review process. For various reasons, we didn’t end up operationalizing that, but it is something we have tried in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Insight traceability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of finding the insight and then taking it right back to the trace evidence, what are your thoughts around allowing that entire journey? Is there any nervousness around building context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different ways you can interpret that. One thing that we’ve heard is a concern from researchers that stakeholders will have confirmation bias. They might try to find the answer they are looking for and uncover insights, take them out of context, and pick and choose the ones that are convenient for the story they’re trying to tell. The danger of opening up the knowledge base and democratizing it is that anyone can go in and find evidence to back their story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My perspective, and it seems to have been received fairly well by people I’ve talked to about it, is that while that is a danger, you’re also presenting the truly democratized opportunity for anyone to go in and look for alternative or countervailing insights. That kind of balances it out because the alternative that exists in most organizations is that people make certain claims and no one can go and check their references. So you’ve already got this confirmation bias problem or even worse, people just making statements about things without any kind of reference or link to evidence. Or when you do get a link, it’s some giant document, making it very hard for people to follow up and dig in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also done a lot of work to make sure that when people drill into a specific insight from within a piece of research we show the surrounding context. That is something that is missing from some ‘atomic’ systems and earlier versions of HITS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The value of a repository&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the overhead of adding to a repository ever cumbersome for researchers, particularly new ones to the team?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where you’re asking anyone to do additional work, if people don’t see a payoff and aren’t bought in or aren’t rewarded for it, you will face real challenges. The perpetual thing that we’re looking at with HITS is how do we add value in the moment, because a lot of the value is deferred, that either you’ll get because you’re putting stuff into a repository for use at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is at the heart of the challenge with even a simple repository where you just upload a document and have to type in the name of the document and include one or two tags. That’s cumbersome to some degree depending on the culture of the team you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Security and compliance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re dealing a lot with security and compliance constraints. Throughout building HITS, have you had to deal with constraints like this internally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that’s particularly problematic because there are all sorts of information you might want to put into a research repository. Particularly if you’re collecting the raw data, the raw notes, the participants’ names - that can get pretty sticky pretty quickly as it relates to GDPR in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our more recent approach is to only allow content that does not have PII and so it’s generally a little abstracted away from identifiable information about anyone personally. If you need a home for your raw data including PII, you open yourself up to a lot of additional challenges. We’ve been fortunate enough at Microsoft to integrate with Microsoft’s GDPR systems and so when people request information about themselves or want to be removed, there are automated or manual processes in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Taxonomies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you share the process for how you define taxonomies and tags, etc? As it relates to standardization and do you allow for folksonomies as it relates to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a set of structured entities in HITS like insights and recommendations, reports, collections, etc. That’s one part of our taxonomy and we tune that to different types of knowledge that we’re trying to create and the important distinctions within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing we do from a taxonomy standpoint, is because Microsoft has a lot of infrastructure, we have a corporate taxonomy that has all of the products, features, and technology that Microsoft works on allowing you to tag your work with whatever product or feature you’re working on. We inherit that and then we have a topic taxonomy that constantly evolves and grows based on the needs of researchers and anything you tag with the topic links to the product pages in HITS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get some requests for folksonomies or lightweight / micro-tagging and I think we will do something like that at some point. We just haven’t got around to figuring out exactly how to execute on it and how to make sure it doesn’t compete with the more formal taxonomy that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will say just on that topic, we’ve radically reduced the number of different types of tags that we had, trying to remove as much friction as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Productizing HITS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a potential for productizing HITS to those outside of Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve considered it, but at the same time, in the past three years there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-repository/&quot;&gt;more and more tools (like Dovetail)&lt;/a&gt; popping up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t suggest going through the experience of building a bespoke solution or internal repository unless you are very well resourced and very patient. Let’s say you’re in a research organization and you are thinking of self-funding and building something. I would look at just taking something off the shelf first or doing something more ad hoc, like using some of the knowledge management platforms that already exist. I wouldn’t go into the middle ground of building your platform unless you’re committed to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, it’s been an incredible journey and has unlocked all sorts of things for us, but it is a substantial undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written by Matt Duignan, Principal User Research Manager, Microsoft and Liz Ross, Content Lead, Dovetail. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing a new way to tell stories – with video and transcription]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-stories-with-video-highlights</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-stories-with-video-highlights</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stories help people communicate ideas and share experiences. Impactful researchers not only have to be skilled facilitators and analysts but expert storytellers too. However, as researchers, we know it’s an ongoing struggle to get our teams and stakeholders to engage with lengthy research reports or raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video is engaging, memorable, and inspirational. It’s the most impactful medium for compelling storytelling and effective communication. Video helps to build empathy in teams, especially in usability testing. There’s no better way for your team to feel affinity for an end-user or a customer than seeing their pain points first hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re announcing a huge evolution in Dovetail with &lt;b&gt;video highlights&lt;/b&gt;, a powerful new way to share research stories about your users and develop a repository of searchable audio and video clips. We’ve been working on this feature for a while, and we’re very excited to share it with you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, go from a recording to tagged, searchable video clips in a matter of minutes, with accurate transcription and powerful tagging features. Let your users speak for themselves with engaging and memorable video highlights that inspire action from your team, and bring your research insights to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;product tour&lt;/a&gt;, or read on for a deep dive walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Built-in, accurate transcription&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring your own recordings from the tools you already use, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.io/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usertesting.com/&quot;&gt;UserTesting&lt;/a&gt;. Just upload your video (or audio file) and transcribe it in one click. We’ll do all the heavy lifting. When your transcript is ready, you can make edits inline, click to seek, name and change speakers, split monologues, and much more. Transcripts in Dovetail are tightly integrated into the existing editor experience you know and love, so features like real-time collaborative editing and undo / redo just work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know how important accurate transcriptions are for research. Your time should be spent actually doing research and not correcting unreliable transcripts. The transcription speech engine we use is trained on 10,000+ hours of human-transcribed content across a diversity of topics, industries, and accents. Our speech recognition model consistently reports some of the lowest &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate&quot;&gt;word error rates (WER)&lt;/a&gt; when compared to other speech recognition models, making our transcripts some of the most reliable anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Create video highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built on Dovetail’s existing powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-data-analysis/&quot;&gt;data analysis and tagging features&lt;/a&gt;, simply select text and tag your transcript to create a set of short audio or video clips across all of your interviews, usability tests, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you create your highlights, you’ll capture key moments in the recording. Navigate to a tag to see trimmed and edited moments for your highlights, without the need for complex video editing software. There’s no need to change how you currently use Dovetail. Just do your analysis and the video magic will happen in the background as you work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video highlights and transcription takes Dovetail closer towards &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/why-we-raised-4m-seed-2020/&quot;&gt;our vision&lt;/a&gt; of being the world-class data analysis platform for user researchers. Throughout 2020 we’ll continue to improve our platform with new ways to speed up analysis through automation, and better segmentation and charts to help you uncover patterns across your research data. This will make the features we’re announcing today even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bring your research to life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re making it easy for you to bring your research ‘to life’ to drive meaningful change and inspire better decision making. With video highlights, it becomes effortless to draw attention to key moments in your interviews and usability tests. Dovetail’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;free, unlimited viewer accounts&lt;/a&gt; allow you to invite your entire team to engage with what your customers are saying, and build empathy that inspires change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transform your long &lt;code&gt;.mp4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.mov&lt;/code&gt; recordings, scattered across Google Drive and Dropbox, into a fully searchable research repository. Centralize your recordings, and search inside of your video files to pinpoint the exact moment a phrase or keyword is mentioned. With video highlights in Dovetail, anyone in your organization can now listen to what your customers are saying, and jump to the context in which they said it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start using it today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video analysis and transcription is entirely free to use during the beta period. After the beta, all plans will come with free included transcription minutes, with the option to purchase additional minutes if you’re doing a lot of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re incredibly excited about what we’ve built and we can’t wait to see the impact video highlights and transcription has in your team and organization!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/video-audio-transcription-for-research/&quot;&gt;product tour&lt;/a&gt; to learn more, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions we can help answer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Collaborative analysis: A better way of involving stakeholders in research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/collaborative-analysis-research-stakeholders</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/collaborative-analysis-research-stakeholders</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Rosenfeld Media’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosenfeldmedia.com/advancing-research-2020/&quot;&gt;Advancing Research 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Dovetail’s UX Designer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-denton-4b6b8059/&quot;&gt;Lucy Denton&lt;/a&gt; presented a talk called ‘Collaborative analysis – a better way of involving stakeholders in research’. Lucy shared the methods that she’s used in her previous role at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; for analyzing and synthesizing research data as a team. Lucy worked there for just over five years as a UX designer and has recently joined the Dovetail team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Involving stakeholders in research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I’m sure others can empathize with, UX resources at Atlassian were usually thinly spread. This meant that for research projects I would often conduct them alone. I would create the research plan, any stimulus needed, such as discussion guides and prototypes, I would conduct the interviews or testing sessions, analyze the data, and then finally I would present my findings back to my stakeholders at the end. A few years ago at Atlassian, and I feel in the industry in general, there was a push to include stakeholders in the research process as an opportunity for them to get exposure to customer pain and build firsthand empathy for the user. There’s a lot of resources about the benefits of including stakeholders in research so I won’t go into it too much here – at a high level having stakeholders involved in the process can give your findings more credibility, and helps you to get buy-in on recommendations later down the line. However, in my experience involving stakeholders in the research process in practice meant inviting product managers and developers to be silent observers in interview sessions. I have found this to be a fairly ineffective and unhelpful way of including them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s not scalable for the whole team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can only really have one or two observers along with the interviewer in the session before it starts to feel overcrowded and potentially uncomfortable for the participant. I have tried various ways to mitigate this including having observers dial into a session with their cameras and audio turned off. However, I of course always introduce them at the beginning of the call (I would never have secret observers), so the participant always knew they were there. I feel that participants are less likely to be open about their struggles or their true feelings towards something when they know that there’s a crowd listening in. For the research projects I was conducting, I would typically do six to eight interviews or usability tests per round. At the time I had 8 team members, plus a product manager and development lead – so 10 people altogether. That meant that my stakeholders could join one, or maybe two sessions per round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stakeholders develop premature conclusions based on a partial sample size&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to one or two interviews at the beginning of the project and then coming back later for the research findings. Playback is not helpful for the researcher or the observer. For one thing, people are likely to draw premature conclusions based on the sessions that they did attend at the beginning – which is a partial sample size. Those conclusions may not reflect the actual research findings, and because there is potentially a longer period between when they attended the sessions and when they hear the overall findings, I’ve found it hard to change their perspective. Even so, people are more likely to remember and add weight to things they heard in person as opposed to something they read in a report or saw on a PowerPoint slide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stakeholders don’t engage with playback reports and presentations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to get stakeholders to engage in research findings presentations – we called these ‘research playbacks’ in my team. I found it especially hard to get stakeholders to engage in and action research when they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; involved in a couple of interviews or testing sessions a week or two prior. In my team some people had this attitude that they feel they were involved in the research and they experience it firsthand, so they believe that they know what the findings are. Again that’s based on a partial sample size, which can misrepresent the research and make it difficult for researchers and designers to move forward. It is also just generally hard to digest and remember findings that are presented in a report or a presentation format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collaborative analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For researchers and others in the UX field, it is the deep analysis process of multiple sessions and synthesis of that data that allows them to build up a holistic understanding of the problems and users, which is really what we’re trying to achieve when we include our stakeholders and team members in the process. In my experience, the analysis and synthesis part of the process is almost always done by one person alone – sometimes two people but they were always two people within the UX team. It rarely included people from the broader team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with scaling this part of the process to include others on the team, particularly those who are not researchers and designers. This is what I would like to share with you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dividing stakeholders into groups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do is split my stakeholders into three groups – the core team, extended team, and leadership team. The core team are primary stakeholders, which for me always included a product manager, and fairly often included a development lead. Then the extended team included the rest of the team who were working on the product or feature that I was studying. This was usually a group of developers. The leadership team included executives and heads-of who were involved more on an informed basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 5 phases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process that I typically used for the types of studies I was conducting – which were exploratory interviews and usability tests – involved five phases. Planning and operations, running sessions, analyzing data, synthesizing data, and then the research playback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Phase 1: Planning and operations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the planning and operations phase I would work closely with my core team to create a research plan and any other stimulus we needed for the study (i.e. discussion guides, prototypes, etc). The core team and I would sit together and discuss research goals, participant criteria, and create these assets together. By doing this everyone can agree and be bought into the research goals, and understand what we’re trying to get out of this research. I also hope that they feel they’ve contributed to the project and have some stake in the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I would recruit and schedule the sessions just as I normally would. For team visibility, I used a Google calendar that was shared with the entire team to schedule sessions, so everyone knew when the sessions were happening. If possible I would include screener answers or demographic information about the participant in the calendar invites. Sometimes that’s not possible with privacy constraints – in my team it depended on the type of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Phase 2: Running sessions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it was time to run the session. As the researcher I would always lead the session, however, the core team was required to attend all sessions. For me, this meant my product manager and engineering lead would sit in on all interviews in a round, for example. Having them attend every session meant continuity for them – they got to experience a complete round of sessions, and we’re able to start building that richer understanding of the user. As they are primary stakeholders in the project they need to invest more time in building that context for their own understanding, but it’s also helpful for researchers and designers to get their buy-in. Later on, you can use your core team for support when communicating research findings to other stakeholders such as the leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my case, the core team were also often leaders of the team. The development lead was the manager of the other developers on the team, and obviously, the product manager is an influential role on the team. I think that if you can motivate the team leaders with customer problems, that energy filters through the rest of the team and makes for a better team direction and moral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Phase 3: Analyze data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each interview session would be audio and video recorded, and then I would use an automated transcribing tool to generate a transcript for each session. Then we enter this analysis phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researcher, I would define a taxonomy upfront based on the research goals. I would also include terms for general themes like pain points, use cases, and then terms for things that are interesting but might not necessarily be relevant to the current study. I would brief the core team and the extended team on how to code a transcript. Then, depending on the scope of the project and the time constraints, I would assign each member of the team transcripts to code. I want individuals in the extended team to gain experience with a larger number of participants. This meant that each transcript is coded several times – maybe up to four times. The process was – each team member had to watch the recording, clean up the transcript where necessary (it was created with an automated transcribing tool), and tag the transcript with themes. If that transcript had already been coded by someone else on the team, they would still listen to the recording and follow the transcript, however, they would review the tags that the previous person had left and added more they felt were necessary. In a way, it’s like peer-reviewing tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my team, I would try to complete the entire collaborative analysis and synthesis process in a time box period, depending on the scope of the project and time constraints. This would usually be either one week or two weeks, and I call this the ‘research sprint’. It is important to move quickly through this process so it stays fresh in everyone’s minds. In my team, particularly the extended team, they do have other responsibilities and other work to do during this time, so time boxing it helps to prioritize alongside other work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the research sprint, at the end of every day that we were coding, we would do what I call the ‘research stand up’. In the research stand up, each person would say their top takeaways from the interview they had listened to and coded that day. The purpose of the stand up is to hear takeaways from the entire team continuously throughout the research project, rather than having a big download of information at the end during the research playback from just one person. It’s quite repetitive, but that repetition of information helps these findings from multiple data points sink in for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Phase 4: Synthesize data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once all the transcripts or notes have been coded, the next step in the research sprint is affinity mapping. I would take all the data points, usually, direct quotes, tagged with themes and we would affinity map those as a group, including the core team and the extended team. I find this process easier to do as a group. I like to include the extended team, if possible, because it ties what they’ve been doing in the coding phase nicely together, and helps them to start building that holistic picture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same session as the affinity mapping, I would facilitate an open discussion with the core and extended teams around what we think the top insights are. Usually, at this point, the top insights are quite obvious, so this was not usually a controversial discussion for my team. In the same discussion, I would also facilitate an open discussion around recommendations. The reason I do all of this in the same meeting is because it’s fresh in people’s minds, and I’m trying to reduce the number of meetings and context switching for the extended team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussing recommendations at this point with stakeholders is really helpful. They are often the subject matter experts in the subject that you’re studying – whether it’s the product you’re improving or a feature you’re building – they can often give great insight at this point. Also, brainstorming recommendations as a group is much better than one person coming up with them on their own. Often the team can point out things that I missed or have a different perspective on something that can make the recommendations richer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is it is important to make sure the discussion doesn’t go too much into design, ideating, or solutionizing – which for my team was often difficult because we love to discuss solutions. This discussion usually takes some pretty strong facilitation muscle – just be prepared for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researcher, I would take everything that the team contributed to the recommendations and insights discussion, and put together the final insights and recommendations for the research playback presentation. It’s important to take the input from the team, but as the person who has experience interpreting this kind of data, it’s a good idea to take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Phase 5: Playback&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ll put together the research playback presentation. At this point, the core team and the extended team should be pretty aware of what the top insights are and the general idea of the recommendations. They also have a lot of context on the project. That is everything that I would usually include in a research playback presentation and report, so it does sometimes feel like an unnecessary step, however, I do think it’s important to follow through on this last part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, this is where I will include my leadership team. In the team that I was working with the leadership team was fairly hands-off, it was very much a bottom-up model. So this was enough involvement for my leadership team. For the extended and core teams, the playback is a good way to reflect and wrap up the project. Again, the repetition of information ensures that those insights stick with those people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The playback assets – whether that is a presentation or a report – are important assets for your research repository.

I change it up and tweak it each time depending on the culture of the team, the time constraints of the project, the topic we’re studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something to take into consideration is that this process does take up a lot of the team’s time and, especially the extended team, do have other responsibilities and work they need to do. I’ve had to compromise with getting the team’s time in the past. For example, for discovery projects where we’re conducting exploratory interviews that might influence the work we do over the next quarter or beyond, it was easier for me to get a week or two of the team’s time. However, for something like usability testing a feature, it didn’t make sense to pull the team away from their work. I was able to include the two developers who were focusing on improving the feature that we were testing. I’ve never had a problem getting the core team’s involvement, as they are primary stakeholders it’s important for them to prioritize research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I know not all leadership teams are as hands-off as the team I was working with. One thing I’ve done to include the leadership team more is invite them to attend the research stand-ups. In doing this they get to hear takeaways from sessions repeatably from the entire team, which can help them feel involved and the repetition of information can help drive home findings later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;That’s a wrap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know every team, company, and research process is slightly different, however, I hope you’re able to take something away from this process and adapt it to your own team. I would love to hear what others are doing to include stakeholders and team members in the research process. Feel free to join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;Slack community&lt;/a&gt; and we can continue the discussion!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting organized with your qualitative research data analysis project]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/qualitative-research-data-analysis-project</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/qualitative-research-data-analysis-project</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Creating &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/research-synthesis-creating-order/&quot;&gt;order from chaos&lt;/a&gt; is part of every researcher’s job description, so it’s no surprise that some tips and tricks have been developed over the years for systematizing the work. Here are some examples of how people in the design research community get themselves organized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get into a good rhythm and the right mental zone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the most important tool sitting between the ears of knowledge workers, working to a research cadence and establishing helpful habits and routines makes the work more sustainable and successful. These could be small things like daily routines that keep everything on track, or big picture priorities that result in better research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Establish a cadence.&lt;/b&gt; It’s easy to focus on the task at hand, but more difficult to juggle other functions that contribute to a successful analysis project. Having &lt;a href=&quot;https://24ways.org/2016/creating-a-weekly-research-cadence/&quot;&gt;regular and frequent touchpoints&lt;/a&gt; helps retain focus and provides a steady stream of progress. Product leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/wrenlanier/&quot;&gt;Wren Lanier&lt;/a&gt;, says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up a weekly cadence accelerated our learning and built momentum behind strategic experiments. It forced us to keep our work small and iterative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use repetition and task order.&lt;/b&gt; Having a routine for things can help form healthy habits, and be a soothing way to trust your competency. Setting flexible traditions is key for reflection and maturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clear your mind.&lt;/b&gt; Turn off distractions as much as possible when you need headspace to focus. It’s not just about efficiency, it’s about mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interruptions driven by task switching and an incessant stream of data have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/944128/worker-interrupted-cost-task-switching&quot;&gt;high psychological costs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gloriamark/&quot;&gt;Dr. Gloria Mark&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are both stressful and costly, they cause higher levels of stress, frustration, mental effort, a feeling of time pressure and mental workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study she conducted, it can take an average of 23 minutes to regain focus on a task after being called away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental ability and focus-time are precious commodities during analysis, and it helps to shut yourself away in a room so you can give things your full attention. Write down any stressful thoughts looping around your mind, reduce web usage, resist your devices, ignore your emails and message alerts, silence your phone, and stay away from social media. Everything you need for doing your analysis exists your immediate four walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make time to think and reflect.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidtravis/?originalSubdomain=uk&quot;&gt;David Travis&lt;/a&gt; has spent 20 years training and coaching user researchers and noticed that there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/the_reflective_user_researcher.html&quot;&gt;one particular behavior&lt;/a&gt; that stood out amongst the most successful user researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn’t just attend training courses and do the work day-to-day. They consciously and deliberately reflected on their work. To really learn from our experience we need to analyze it, deliberately and consciously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflection is powerful because experience alone does not always lead to acquiring skills. Thinking critically about your work as a researcher and analyst is about assessing your performance. Articulate and record your experiences and thinking in writing, such as a journal, and revisit it regularly. Ask yourself some revealing questions. Why did you do things that way? What theory underpins that approach? Are there alternatives you could have used?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make intentional plans.&lt;/b&gt; Take fifteen minutes at the start of the day, or the end of the day before, to make a rough daily plan for your research and analysis tasks, and to understand what you’re aiming for. It makes it easier to assess and adjust things when new priorities inevitably develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collate to make your data visible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much raw data, things get messy and it’s easy to lose sight of what&amp;#39;s been collected (or what&amp;#39;s still missing). Gathering it all together and storing it in one place makes it much more accessible and approachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set up a standardized digital filing structure.&lt;/b&gt; Having a directory for each research project usually works best. It’s an object-oriented approach that allows you to quickly and easily group things by their cohesive unit—the people you’re learning from. It’s not the only approach you can take, for example, you might instead consider filing things by date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/khmelevsky/&quot;&gt;Alexander Khmelevsky&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://clay.global/&quot;&gt;design agency Clay&lt;/a&gt;, says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the work is coming in on a daily basis, the results should also be so. That’s why we store daily results in a folder named with the date, like ‘2018–11–25’. This way, the daily research material can also easily be assembled into a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collate your materials.&lt;/b&gt; There will be documents, session notes, observations, drawings, artifacts, photos, videos, and email correspondence you’ve amassed from your various primary research methods. Don’t forget to include academic literature and website clippings if you’ve conducted secondary research too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Include relevant participant data.&lt;/b&gt; Make sure you have a participant profile that allows team members to quickly scan a participant’s key traits, even if recruiting screeners, permissions, and personal data are kept safely elsewhere. You’ve got a natural behavioral persona right in front of you, the starting point for further thinking. You might include demographic or segmentation data too. Be very mindful of your &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/2020/gdpr-design-researchers/&quot;&gt;GDPR obligations&lt;/a&gt; and practice good anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to ensure compliance and respect for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study and convert field notes.&lt;/b&gt; Rewrite and expand the entries you scribbled during sessions or in breaks between participants. This is a good opportunity to edit them for clarity and accuracy, and to add comments that articulate how you understand things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transcribe audio recordings&lt;/b&gt; from interviews, contextual inquiries, walkthroughs and other events in the field. Check the transcriptions for any errors, and edit them for accuracy. Add comments and tags where these will help clarify and categorize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photograph and transcribe handwritten journals&lt;/b&gt; and diaries and other image records into indexable and digitally searchable formats. Having a digital image serves as a sharable artifact, and as a backup. If your &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt; includes the ability to import images, you can start doing this too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download open-ended responses&lt;/b&gt; from surveys and other qualitative inputs. Online tools often allow CSV or spreadsheet exports that give you full access to the raw data. Clean these up by beginning the process of filtering, summarising, and labeling, while protecting the integrity of the original data itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use the power of your team’s collective mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/ux-debriefing-methods-c9f971094c58&quot;&gt;Caitria O’Neill&lt;/a&gt;, a senior UX researcher at Google, jokes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re tired. You just interviewed seven people back-to-back in a small room lined with one-way glass. You’re already starting to lose track of who said what. Your team is in the observation room, hangry and quickly losing focus. This is a perfect time for a debrief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debrief together.&lt;/b&gt; The analysis of qualitative information shouldn’t be a solitary activity, and this begins right at research collection. Consolidate your notes together, and as soon as possible after running research. This helps the team learn from each other, care for each other, builds consensus, and helps triage any emerging issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team debriefs work best when someone takes charge to facilitate the conversation, but teams will quickly learn to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look for meaning, not just facts.&lt;/b&gt; The goal is to explore how fresh inputs from the research contribute meaning and understanding, more than just regurgitating what happened in the session. O’Neill says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps the group move past superficial insights to actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for example, rather than noting that a participant ‘didn’t like the button’, move towards thinking about something more insightful, such as ‘why people were worried about leaving the site’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discuss the key things you’ve found, and talk about any highlights and patterns that might indicate an insight being formed from various findings. Capture and structure all of this collective thinking on whiteboards, or on walls with sticky notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use collaboration to start documenting.&lt;/b&gt; You might also share things asynchronously with a research collaboration tool that supports your team’s way of working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think individually, act collaboratively.&lt;/b&gt; Working together enables sense-checking amongst the team of people conducting the research. They act as sounding boards for possible interpretations and opportunities for further research, which leads to healthy cross-pollination of ideas and the raising of new approaches. It’s easier to align on these things if you’ve had debriefs after each participant. It keeps everyone abreast of the latest data, provides a reason to summarize learnings, and is often a time where observations and highlights suggest tags or themes that are emerging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Establish a command headquarters for your research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a thinking space of your own will save the need to pack down and set up every day. Making it your research happy place will help you switch into research mode the instant you enter the door. The physical layout actively encourages your latent synthesis skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as a ‘mind palace’, an aid to memory and data visualization. Make this a physical space that presents an ordered version of what you carry in your mind. It will act as an evolving mosaic that documents your exploration and growing understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkolko/&quot;&gt;Jon Kolko&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the Austin Center for Design, explains how abductive thinking and sensemaking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonkolko.com/writingAbductiveThinking.php&quot;&gt;are key tools&lt;/a&gt; in reaching synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quantity of data that must be analyzed is often too large to hold in attentive memory at one time, and so a designer will externalize the data through a process of spatialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply through arranging the information physically, we can go a long way towards finding and making novel connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reserve a work area.&lt;/b&gt; Having a dedicated place you’ll be comfortable in, such as a meeting room or board room, a cluster of desks in the corner. It should have plenty of room to lay things out: tables, sideboards, walls. Air circulation is good! Book it for at least a week and make sure it is somewhere your data can be left alone without needing to pack down every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assemble a toolbox of useful aids.&lt;/b&gt; Thinking tools such as index cards, Blu Tack, pads of sticky notes in a couple of different colors, small sticky tabs for labeling, highlighters, sharpies, scissors, sticky tape, and any other stationery that you find personally helpful for getting data up and out and categorized into a physical space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prepare your blank canvas.&lt;/b&gt; You want lots of flatwork surfaces, whether they be glass walls, windows, whiteboards, foam, or cork. Some people use interactive whiteboards as a useful way of straddling the physical-virtual divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have your collated research data on hand.&lt;/b&gt; Easy enough with a laptop and a printer. It can sometimes help to have almost everything printed out, not just transcripts, but that is often pretty wasteful. And if you do bring your laptop into the war room, watch out for the potential distractions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supply brain food.&lt;/b&gt; Pound for pound, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-brain-need-s/&quot;&gt;your brain uses more energy&lt;/a&gt; than any other part of your body, and while it doesn’t necessarily use more power when thinking than when resting, it’s still responsible for around 20% of your body’s overall energy use. Thinking can be tiring! For good memory, concentration, and brain health, you need to sleep well and have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-brain-foods&quot;&gt;good daily diet&lt;/a&gt;, but for quick boosts to your alertness, mood and concentration look to caffeine, berries, seeds, nuts, and chocolate for good options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expect to go a bit bonkers.&lt;/b&gt; You’ll be so deep in engaging with the data that you’ll come out clutching a sentence clipped from a printed transcript, eyes gleaming, and wonder why others aren’t quite as excited about the insight you’ve just surfaced that is destined to ignite the rest of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stay connected with your research purpose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear goal for your research allows you to focus your questions and investigations and, in turn, produce specific themes in what you learn. You can use this kind of focus to predict likely tags you might connect with relevant parts of your notes and transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikki Anderson, the founder of the User Research Academy, understands the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/elevate-your-research-objectives-745cf9415d5b&quot;&gt;good objectives&lt;/a&gt; to good insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I have started really paying attention to, and honing, my research objectives, my interviews have visibly improved and my confidence in interviewing has greatly increased. Besides that, it is a fun exercise to deconstruct a problem statement into smaller puzzle pieces that move you toward your goal!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many rabbit holes to explore, and you want to ensure you pick the right ones that maintain your focus. Go back to your research goals. Trace them through to the questions you asked in research sessions and, in turn, to the answers you received. Think ahead and continue these threads in the way you tag and label your research as you begin analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move forward by reducing and reprioritizing data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joy Frechtling, an expert in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/nsf97153/start.htm&quot;&gt;mixed-method evaluations&lt;/a&gt; at the National Science Foundation, says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginners often fail to understand that even at this stage, the data do not speak for themselves. A common mistake many people make in quantitative as well as qualitative analysis, in a vain effort to remain ‘perfectly objective,’ is to present a large volume of unassimilated and uncategorized data for the reader’s consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good argument for ‘less is more’, as long as your clippings and summaries are tightly aligned with your research purpose. Data reduction, sometimes called ‘data concentration’, involves selecting, focusing, simplifying, abstracting and transforming your raw data. For manageability, the amount of data needs to be condensed and, again, this should be guided primarily by your research goals. Qualitative data have a personal association for the researcher beyond just the words that have been recorded; they represent real people, places, and events so it can be difficult to sort and discard things. The acid test must be how the pieces address the salient research questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maintenance required&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintenance is required to stay on top of your organized research. You don’t head to the gym for a workout, achieve fitness, and then stop exercising. Being organized is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than waiting until after you’ve finished collecting all your research data, it’s good practice to store and organize things from the get-go. As well as satisfying the neat freak of your inner librarian, you can use it as an opportunity to begin analysis early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of each research day, or even at the end of each session, practice good data organization practices. Store and organize as you go, including getting stuck into analysis tasks while you’re still researching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research repositories in 10 minutes]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-repositories-10-minutes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-repositories-10-minutes</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At both UX Australia’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uxaustralia.com.au/conferences/design-research-2020&quot;&gt;Design Research 2020&lt;/a&gt; and Rosenfeld Media’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosenfeldmedia.com/advancing-research-2020/&quot;&gt;Advancing Research 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Dovetail’s CEO, Benjamin, presented a talk called ‘Research Repositories in 10 minutes’. He spoke about what a research repository is, what problems they are trying to solve and covered some principles to guide decision-making if people were planning to set one up for their own organization. Below is a lightly edited transcript of the talk with an additional Q&amp;amp;A at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a research repository?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It started in 2017 with the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f&quot;&gt;Democratizing UX&lt;/a&gt; published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomersharon/&quot;&gt;Tomer Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, then Head of User Experience at WeWork. In this article, which went on to become extremely popular, he coined the terms atomic research and nuggets. A couple of years later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-duignan-89493932/&quot;&gt;Matt from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; published an article called ’&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-microsofts-human-insights-library-creates-a-living-body-of-knowledge-fff54e53f5ec&quot;&gt;How Microsoft’s human insights library creates a living body of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;’. This was released in June 2019 after Microsoft built its internal system, HITS. In the article, he talks about collaboration with researchers and how insights should be created throughout the project rather than a big cliff to climb up at the end of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The period of June, July, and August of 2019, was a very hot time for research repository stories. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-jones-13b73898/&quot;&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt; from GitLab wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/10/building-a-ux-research-insights-repository/&quot;&gt;‘Why we built a UX Research Insights repository’&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/etienne-fang-5a671a4/&quot;&gt;Etienne&lt;/a&gt; from Uber wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/uber-design/the-power-of-insights-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-new-insights-platform-at-uber-26f85becc2e6&quot;&gt;‘The Power of Insights: A behind-the-scenes look at the new insights platform at Uber’&lt;/a&gt;, Kaleidoscope. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosenfeldmedia.com/&quot;&gt;Rosenfeld Media&lt;/a&gt; also held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosenfeldmedia.com/advancing-research-community/archive/videoconference-power-of-insights-why-sharing-is-better-than-silos-with-ubers-insights-platform/&quot;&gt;video conference&lt;/a&gt; on the subject and Etienne shared that Kaleidoscope was built in people’s spare time over months. So these are the internal tools that organizations have invested in. After hearing about these platforms and also talking to our customers, we landed on the following definition of what a research repository really means. We think it’s a centralized, searchable database of research and insights that the entire company leverages to make better decisions. The whole point is to allow everybody to uncover user research insights and explore the context that led to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why set up a research repository?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is why does everyone seem to want to set up a research repository and what exactly are the problems they are trying to solve? After talking to our customers and reading through the articles, I’ve summarized some of the problems to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Problems repositories try to solve&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Teams are siloed&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is conducted differently across teams and departments, especially in large organizations. Different methodologies, tools, and formats for insights can cause silos. Here’s a quote from a customer interview we conducted last week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to bring research through the entire business to all of the fragmented areas so that we can cross-pollinate our research. So, really about trying to break down those silos between teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Research is repeated&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;New team members join and ask the same questions over and over. Similar projects are run repeatedly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherifmansour&quot;&gt;Sherif, a Product Manager&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is how to help team members build a key insight that existing members have realized. The cost of relearning is expensive, especially in growing organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research repository should allow an organization to leverage its pre-existing customer knowledge as it builds over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Reliance on tribal knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undocumented knowledge means you have to know who to talk to. When that person leaves the organization, they take their knowledge with them. We refer to this as tribal knowledge, and relying on it in any organization is dangerous. Another quote from a customer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to stop relying on one person who has been here for seven years. People in your company are known as know it alls and often pestered for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Reports aren’t standardized&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because everyone works differently and we’re in a gestation period for the discipline of user research, research reports aren’t standardized. We’ve seen Powerpoints, blog posts, Confluence pages, and more. Without a consistent format, it can be difficult to leverage the insights from the past. This is what Tomer Sharon was talking about—having consistency for the formats makes it easier to store, search, and leverage that past research. Reports should also be more compelling, interactive, and include different media. All the context for the research should be linked in the report itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Data is spread across tools&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, research data is spread across a variety of tools. Most people are familiar with Google Drive, Dropbox, Airtable, Word documents, and of course, sticky notes. While these tools are all great in their own right, they are limited in that you can’t really search them. When they pull that wall of sticky notes down, they are gone. Sticky notes also require people to actually be in the room, which is not so good for remote work. Another customer indicated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had developed a treasure-trove of research over the years and felt limited by traditional file-sharing platforms which only allowed us to put the research into the one place but not explore and digest the information in an intuitive and user-friendly way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These appear to be the most common problems that motivate people to implement a research repository. We also found an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/archiving-usability-reports/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Nielsen_(usability_consultant)&quot;&gt;Jakob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/&quot;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group&lt;/a&gt; from 2005, indicating that when people have to locate existing usability reports, they’ll fail, or they won’t know what to look for because there is no single place that lists usability results. Worse, if past project owners are the only source, you risk losing this when they leave the company or their roles are reassigned. While in this example, Jakob is specifically talking about usability reports, he predicted the whole trend 15 years ago, talking about the lack of a single place and the institutional memory when people leave the company or move projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 principles to guide your decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re sold and you want to set up a repository, and you feel your organization will benefit from it. Here are a few principles to keep in mind to guide the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle 1: Retrievable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that researchers are busy and often outnumbered. The whole purpose of a repository is to help scale a research team to service the entire organization. This means that the repository has to support the ability to retrieve answers to questions in a self-service way. As a tangible example of that, something like search should be effortless, free of complicated queries, filters, or views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle 2: Approachable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know some stakeholders don’t feel comfortable interacting with research, especially if there is clunky software that requires training. We should also encourage everyone to make data-backed decisions. The head of research for one of our customers shared their Dovetail project with the board of their company, like a big public company, and had the board kind of playing around with it. She recounted that it was a huge win because the members of the board felt connected to their end-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle 3: Traceable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence helps to build trust in the research team. I’m sure you are familiar with bringing in a stakeholder—for example, a developer—into a usability testing session or interview and seeing their first-hand reaction to observing a user. Traceability between the insight and where it came from is very important and helps to keep biases in check by providing that extra context for people to explore the data on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle 4: Accessible&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that researchers want to build participation to create empathy with end-users. It’s a very common thing that researchers like doing, but it’s counterproductive if you have the research data locked away somewhere. The idea of the repository is to create a level playing field regarding access to data. Tangible examples are features like open by default permissions and one-click sign-on for easy authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle 5: Secure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we live in the age of regulation like &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/gdpr-design-researchers/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act&quot;&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt;. Your repository will store sensitive data, so it’s important to consider storage policies, deletion policies, features like encryption and anonymization, and further requirements this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A few other things to think about&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few other things to think about which might prompt you to ask further questions. Things like, how will you get buy-in from the org? The repository won’t be successful only one or two people using it. Who is going to have access? If you are going to allow everybody to have access, will they create insights or just be viewers? How will you migrate past research data? Will you pick a time and say that from here on out we’ll be using the repository? What kind of data will you store? So, for instance—interview transcripts, video recordings, usability testing notes, maybe survey responses, and NPS? And who will manage the taxonomy? And guard it and make sure it doesn’t turn into the Wild West? Who will standardize and be the guardian of the data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions from Design Research 2020&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bensonlow&quot;&gt;Benson Low, UX Research Manager&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rea-group.com/&quot;&gt;REA Group&lt;/a&gt; asked :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the adoption of repositories grow in the last 12 months? There is certainly a lot of talk about them, but are you seeing their adoption?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Benjamin indicated that the folks at Dovetail have been inundated with people talking about finding ways to set up their repository, looking for tools to help them out, etc. Most organizations can’t afford to do what the big guys have done and build their own internal platform. They appeared to be either big teams working on the project or longer-term part-time projects that the researchers initiated and received developer assistance to help them actually build-out. Organizations trying to solve their research problems with tools makes a lot of sense. It seems to be a reaction to the general rise of research inside companies. As a designer, Benjamin highlighted the parallel to what happened to design when designers managed to get a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another question that was asked was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When beginning to set up a repository and using a tool like Dovetail, do you have a suggestion about whether you should bring in the past information? Like research that you already have? Or does it make more sense to start from scratch? Doing the former and bringing everything, your historical data in can feel overwhelming what are your thoughts on that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many different methodologies and formats of data including video, text, transcripts, notes, survey responses, both structured and unstructured. Importing it and transforming it into a format that makes sense for whatever tool you’re deciding to use is difficult. We see a lot of customers just draw a line in the sand and say we’re going to start from here. Or maybe they do a gradual rollout and use it for interviews but not for survey responses. When importing data, often unstructured qualitative data, you end up realizing just how much you actually have. The question is whether it’s really worth it, which is up to each organization to decide how valuable that stuff is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions from Advancing Research 2020&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you discuss how to balance open and secure? For example, how do you balance the privacy of individual participants and their feedback but then easily share it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of our customers face the challenge of balancing the richness of having demographic information available versus anonymization. Obviously, if you can put a face to the name, then that helps to build empathy with stakeholders and makes it a lot more real for them. So, I would always try and encourage organizations to find a way to do that within the constraints of privacy and regulation. Whether that’s getting participants to sign waiver forms, or combatting it by choosing the right software that will allow you to achieve that. When customers can’t get approval, something we’ve seen is customers completely or partially anonymize the data. They might look at mapping the data from another tool that holds a code or a key for the data they put into Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is heavily dependent on your organization. We’ve found that some companies are fine with storing personal information, because they have various checkpoints and a secure vendor assessment process. But other companies are stricter, and this often depends on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion is that being able to put a face to the name and getting your stakeholders to resonate with real people is valuable. It’s just a matter of how can you make that work within the constraints of your organization. Fundamentally research is about the people, it’s about the humans behind the software, and I think if you start to take that away, then it loses a lot of its impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When small product teams have adopted Dovetail, are there any particular conditions that made having a research repository successful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically you’ll find success when the organization is bought into it. If you think about the whole point behind a repository, it’s to allow the research organization or research function to scale. In that regard, it’s about allowing the insights to go further than they would if it was just a researcher that had to push them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do believe in the whole idea of a self-service platform – some of our customers even refer to Dovetail as a ‘portal’. People need to be able to just log in and find answers to questions they have, that will ultimately help them make better decisions. We’ve seen this with quantitative tooling like Google Analytics and Mixpanel, where they can roll out access to analytics to the whole organization. Product managers and designers use access to these tools to make decisions, and I think it’s the same sort of thing with qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a small team inside a larger organization, having buy-in from everyone is important, and having stakeholders leverage the data that’s there. If you don’t have that then you are facing the same issue of silos or research existing only within the product team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have any thoughts on trying to build an insights repository to move away from the concept of providing a summary of the insights as a PDF?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve found that a lot of discussion around research repositories is specifically talking about insight repositories, where it’s like a CMS that you put your PDFs in at the end of the project. We don’t feel like that’s a great evolution over current file storage software or existing CMS tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe in the traceability of starting with raw data—whether that’s an interview transcript, survey responses, or whatever methodology you’re doing—and then building these insights out over time, rather than it being this singular point at the end. Some of our customers have started using Dovetail for analysis and then they’ll put screenshots from Dovetail into their PDFs. At some point, they realize that it doesn’t make a lot of sense. They may as well just stay in the tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDFs are popular because you can email them to people, but they’re not interactive at all. You can’t put videos in there and playback videos of usability testing sessions. I think it’s about trying to understand where the weaknesses of your current form of communication exist and maybe pivoting away to embrace the richness of a web product. It’s also important to identify how you can benefit from a research repository when you’ve got the raw data there as well as the output. I think that’s valuable and often overlooked because there’s plenty of CMS systems around like WordPress that would make a great research repository, if all you cared about was insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value is being able to go from the place holding all the data (video recordings, demographic information, survey responses) and then connecting it to insights which allow you to go back into that data and build a deeper connection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maintain context: minimize notes, tags, and insights]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/minimize-notes-tags-insight</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/minimize-notes-tags-insight</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During analysis, people work across many different notes, tags, and insights – sometimes across projects.

This is familiar territory for many researchers who rarely get to dictate the terms for proactive groundwork, and who usually need to manage reactive studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparing well includes considering things early while also remaining flexible to change. The aim is to develop a big-picture view of the research work while also tempering over-thinking and under-resourcing with lightly-held opinions about the outcomes. Embodying the values of ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uxmas.com/2016/semper-gumby-embracing-flexibility-in-user-research/&quot;&gt;Semper Gumby&lt;/a&gt;’ and adapting to change while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-one-page-user-research-plan&quot;&gt;planning the research&lt;/a&gt; and approaching a state of readiness for the analysis itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What that preparation and readiness will look like in practice is determined by the data, the methods used to collect it, and the purposes of your research efforts. The secret to effectively navigating analysis lies in recognizing the connections between these elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inherent connections between research goals and research outcomes signal that your analysis journey begins when you create a plan for your research, not after you’ve finished assembling all the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A holistic view supports flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, in an attempt to provide rigor and depth to the work, the research process is deconstructed into discrete stages and substages related to planning, collection, or analysis. This kind of partitioning might align with high-level decisions or allow focus. Still, it can also impact your opportunity to be mindfully adaptive to the inevitable challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to monitor how assumptions and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/user-research-the-importance-of-hypotheses&quot;&gt;hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; are forming and how the data’s relevance and quality appear in light of your research questions. This kind of analysis can begin as soon as the raw information can be accessed. There is no need to wait until after collection to start prodding and poking to see what the investigations are about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The advantages of early analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of taking small, analytical bites into research as early as reasonably possible is called ‘periodic analysis’. Most experienced qualitative researchers consider it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/07/analysis-isnt-cool.php&quot;&gt;good practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing analysis concurrently with data collection can be very rewarding for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get to see what the data looks like as you&amp;#39;re collecting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can collect new data to balance any critical gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can identify if you&amp;#39;re asking the wrong questions and fix them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are afforded the opportunity to question routine assumptions and form rivaling hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are able to use research to test new hypotheses formed during the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can move back and forth between thinking about the data and ways to collect new and better data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can energize your fieldwork and help avoid pressure and boredom that can come from unrelenting interview schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant advantage of periodic analysis is that it saves you from dealing with an insurmountable amount of research data. Having familiarized with the data and drafted some ways of thinking about it, means you’ll already be on your journey to insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research health checks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis during collection helps assess the health of your research. Just as you may go to the dentist or mechanic for proactive care, you can incorporate checkpoints to evaluate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/457/974&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; of your research projects or continuous collection activities. You can do this by jumping into your research data and starting to analyze it in small chunks while still continuing to collect data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If high-quality data is the ultimate purpose of research, how might you look across your people, processes, research methods, documentation, and project alignment with the organization and your target audience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/individual-interviews.html&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/a&gt; prepared for interviews with research participants experiencing any issues in producing high-quality data? This might help identify collection errors relating to methods or highlight that your line of questioning could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the process for tagging transcripts in a digital tool working in the way you hoped it might? Change is inevitable and a part of progress, so keeping an eye on the way it impacts your work will help you make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the research team communicating and debriefing well together? Are there things missing that might cause misalignments in how to collect or interpret data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/&quot;&gt;affinity mapping activities&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/160940691301200117&quot;&gt;data displays&lt;/a&gt; resulting in useful data? This helps highlight assumptions and challenges hypotheses to help adapt research and find the most valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Capturing post-session impressions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the researcher&amp;#39;s interpretations and the evidence in the data guides the analysis process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping notes during sessions helps tame some of your mind’s acuity and maintain focus while moderating. These moments with participants and interviewees can provide a valuable set of impressions about the individuals, understanding of context, follow up questions, needs for better research focus, and other ideas and feelings that build empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These rich impressions fade quickly and can be difficult to re-conjure if not adequately articulated. This is where allowing enough time between sessions is critical. Interviewing four or five participants in a single day can blur our memory. Some solo researchers allow 15 minutes to fill out and tidy up their scribbled field notes while refocusing for the next session. Collaborative teams of researchers might allow 45 minutes for similar reasons, but spend this time collectively discussing and documenting their observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field notes form the crux of the earliest available data. They capture the highlights and critical impressions considered most compelling and make an excellent starting point for developing key learnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They become an initial framework for later analysis to help fill in with other evidence from transcriptions and other artifacts. Importantly, notes often reflect interpretations of what you’ve seen, so keep your journey accountable as your understanding increases over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tagging data as we go&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common to begin tagging data when you gather notes and conduct post-session reviews. Tags or shorthand labels that can be jotted in the margins or as part of session comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers or note-takers use a pre-prepared taxonomy to record specific or expected responses during sessions. More commonly, tagging is done afterward by &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/research-stories-with-video-highlights&quot;&gt;highlighting chunks in a transcription record of the session&lt;/a&gt; or slicing and labeling various forms of qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The codes used in tagging might be known upfront, but you’ll likely find that you need to add new tags as you go, or that the tags you already have are skewed with assumptions. The power of tagging as you go lies in indexing the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no need to wait until data collection is complete before checking how it is shaping up. You see the beginnings of possible patterns emerging, and note the effect of particular variables on the themes you’re exploring. If you’re concerned about making judgments without a full picture, assess continually and confirm your findings at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of going back to reconsider previous decisions and adjust or iterate on analysis as you gain a better understanding of a topic are well-known. But qualitative research, where people are at the focus of the study, is well suited to a reciprocal process of data collection and data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of analysis is such a mentally intensive process that you probably welcome opportunities to spread the load over time. It will give you thinking space for ideas to develop and mature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The role of synthesis in creating order from research chaos]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/research-synthesis-creating-order</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/research-synthesis-creating-order</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you think of researchers in their ‘war rooms’, images of surfaces covered in clippings and Post-it notes come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing qualitative information from primary research can be a daunting prospect and most researchers want to do more than simply report facts. They seek insightful truths that compel their teams to empathize before exploring how issues might be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a noble aspiration, but it begins to whither when faced with a seemingly impossible amount of carefully collected details. How do experienced research professionals confront such a mountain? What kind of alchemy is it that helps them distill meaning from this madness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feats of focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most overwhelming aspect of research can be the sheer amount of reading that’s required to understand the material. The average one-hour interview transcript might contain 10,000 words and you&amp;#39;re looking at half a dozen of these, and that’s before the workshop output, diaries / journals, visual documentation, or observation notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with a clear focus, and after using data reduction techniques, it’s possible to have more than 70,000 words that need to be digested – the length of some novels. You&amp;#39;re expected to read the text, understand and deconstruct it, all within a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis can be described with a relatively predictable process, but before we’re able to apply a generalized approach, we need to understand the reasons why we do analysis in the first place and the principles that guide it. In this article, we’ll also define what a good insight looks like, and explore some common challenges faced when getting your head around the collected data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why analyze at all?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under pressure, it might be tempting to go directly from doing an interview to defining a solution to fit the perceived needs. In practice, that creates some problems. If done properly, good analysis will connect specific findings to a specific approach, with clear constraints, and even a roadmap for developing particular solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t shortcut how to unpack and understand your audience. Attempts to merely rely on human memories and impressions from interviews are likely to introduce bias. And even if we did keep notes, when we consume raw data directly, we’re in danger of unconsciously giving weight to certain points. From there we’ll likely form misleading opinions that lead to impulsive decision-making, and eventually, take the whole team down a path that focuses on the entirely wrong outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the most reliable way forward should aim to assemble the material and make balanced deductions based on the evidence. From there we can use the facts to tell a compelling story. It’s this foundation that accurately communicates the right findings and determines the ultimate quality of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The qualities of a good insight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the insights we surface should always inspire action in the people receiving the research results. ‘Insight amnesia’ is a phenomenon that a lot of researchers will recognize. After a ground-breaking presentation of the research results, team members and stakeholders return to their work bubbling with comments. Initially, they’re excited but then the attention fades and momentum is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way a researcher can impact the direction of a product is to provide insights that speak the truth in a compelling and actionable way. Michael Morgan, Senior User Experience Researcher at Bloomberg, has reflected on what this actually means. He shared a succinct description of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/06/what-makes-a-good-research-insight-great.php&quot;&gt;what makes a good research insight great&lt;/a&gt; in his column on UX Matters and says: Although not all insights from user research will meet all six of these criteria; you should consider insights that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are grounded in real data: &lt;/b&gt;Draw your conclusions only from what you actually see and hear. Let your intuition flow from your interpretation of actual evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use simple language and concepts: &lt;/b&gt;Separate any concepts and express them as independent insights—especially if each of them has significant design implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are meaningful and memorable: &lt;/b&gt;An insight that tells a story is the ultimate empathy builder. When stakeholders hear a compelling story, it is as if they are experiencing the pain or joy of the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speak to the audience: &lt;/b&gt;The most effective insights are those that move people in a certain way. They come from answering stakeholders’ burning questions that help shape core research goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inspire action: &lt;/b&gt;Insights from research should be actionable for UX designers and product teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reinforce ownership and commitment: &lt;/b&gt;When stakeholders feel that they own an idea—or, in this case, a hypothesis—they are more likely to honor their commitment to follow through on any actions their idea generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Why’, not just ‘what’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common to hear UX practitioners talking about their focus on helping define the ‘why that happens behind the visuals’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-quantitative-research/&quot;&gt;‘Quantitative’ data&lt;/a&gt;, with its numbers and metrics, often exposes the symptoms of usability issues, or a mismatch between a product and the needs of the people using it. The strengths of quantitative measurements are in defining ‘how much’, and ‘how often’, and it’s relatively rare to get an answer about ‘why’ something is happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-quantitative-research/&quot;&gt;‘Qualitative data’&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, shows behavior and attitude, and embraces the sometimes illogical nature of people to get much closer to understanding motivations and causative factors. However, it’s also not immune from missing the mark. It’s a common misstep in qualitative research to get excited about identifying an issue or a particular behavior, and fail to pursue the reason why it is occurring. Not knowing the root cause, and the context around it, means you’re unable to suggest what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/user-ux-research-repository//&quot;&gt;research repositories&lt;/a&gt; and libraries are structured around findings. You need to be mindful that the luxury of being able to remix findings, participate in a research democracy, or access intelligence over a longer timescale doesn’t excuse anyone from delivering meaningful and timely insights, only possible with a comprehensive meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Navigating common analysis challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a systematic approach, researchers can often find themselves in a mire of mistakes. The idea is to stay organized and focused by following a reliable process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Maria Rosala, a specialist in UX research with the Nielsen Norman Group, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thematic-analysis/&quot;&gt;most common challenges&lt;/a&gt; that researchers face when analyzing qualitative material are due to the large quantities of richly detailed and sometimes contradictory data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Large quantities of information to digest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria explains how superficial or selective analysis can be caused by skim reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long transcripts and extensive field notes can be time-consuming to read; you may have a hard time seeing patterns and remembering what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data reduction techniques and the confidence and support to launch in and proceed steadily can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dense information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth of detail itself can make it hard to separate useful and superfluous facts, and researchers become frozen with indecision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis simply becomes a regurgitation of what participants’ may have said or done, without any analytical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes discipline, collaboration, prioritization, and perhaps—counter-intuitively—some additional research to clarify what you’re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contradictory findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A finding that contradicts another is a common occurrence. It might even be expected when dealing with multiple participants but things can get particularly confusing when a single participant says two different things. Inevitably this increases the difficulty in objectively reaching conclusive findings, because, as Maria puts it, when:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participant feedback is conflicting, or, worse, viewpoints that don’t fit with the researcher’s belief are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compensate, hold the conflicting findings in balance and look beyond their binary nature for other suggestions that might better describe what is happening. To do this, you may need to seek clarification through further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unclear goals for research and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other challenges might not be inherent in the data, but could stem from a lack of goal setting for the analysis itself. Maria says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aims of the initial data collection are lost because researchers can easily become too absorbed in the detail. The analysis lacks focus and the research reports on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an awkward position to be in, as you’re already committed to what you’ve done. If this happens, the first step is to see if there is enough crossover in your research with what you should have been exploring. If there isn’t, you may need to go back and repeat the process, so the earlier you recognize the misalignment, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Allowing synthesis to emerge during analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By its most basic definition, &lt;i&gt;analysis&lt;/i&gt; is about sifting through research material to identify facts and frame problems. To go beyond a mere assortment of facts and breakthrough into an awareness of what we can conclude about these facts is &lt;i&gt;synthesis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best research involves both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthesis can emerge organically during analysis—if we recognize it, and allow it to happen. It’s apparent in those moments when we first glimpse patterns across data sets, or get an intuition about a thread of truth amongst a mishmash of options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But relying on our instincts in an environment demanding evidence will be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Harnessing ‘gut feel’ responsibly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuition is sometimes seen as a magical sixth sense or as something that emerges from an obscure inner force, but it is actually a mental process triggered by our perception. We might have a fleeting impression of a visual inconsistency, a fact out of place, a facial expression, a sense of tone, or some other thing that has registered without conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be more helpful to think of insights as ‘rapid cognition’, or as ‘condensed reasoning’ that uses shortcuts in our brain to link two disparate concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, our brain loves to find meaning. It receives multiple simultaneous inputs from our senses, and when attempting to create connections it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200705/gut-almighty&quot;&gt;matches to the closest kindred pattern&lt;/a&gt; from amongst the vast repository of our memories and experiences. The definition of ‘closest’ is unique to each of us at any given point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuition is therefore not the &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;conscious processing of cues, such as those used in first impressions. Neither is it the deliberate reasoning used by our forebrain. The non-conscious thinking of intuition has strong links to our subjective preferences and spontaneous feelings. Experience is encoded in our brains as an intricate web of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.theteamw.com/2016/07/08/the-next-100-things-you-need-to-know-about-people-118-memories-are-unreliable/&quot;&gt;both fact and feeling&lt;/a&gt;, and so our understanding and recall of memories are interwoven with emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeking of our brains for kindred connections also means that the deeper and longer we go into familiarizing with the research data, the better. The more exposure we have to contexts and the more ways we slice and dice the information in our subsequent attempts to analyze it, the more reliable our intuitions will be. They will be surfacing from a richer array of collected patterns and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher&amp;#39;s brain can be like a cauldron, and the experience of researching as some kind of pottage. Many ingredients can be put in, over and over again, to replenish the goodness over different seasons. Things change with time, and the longer things cook, the more balanced and nuanced the flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we’ve already spent hours with people having conversations, asking questions and listening to them, observing behavior and context, and building empathy. To a limited extent, we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; them. If we, therefore, resonate strongly with a particular comment and can connect it to a pattern in other comments, then we’re probably onto something worth further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The art and science of synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to emphasize the need to connect our hunches to similar comments or data points. It is wise to evaluate our intuition on balance with the evidence, and in the full light of factual data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this kind of backing, our inkling may just be distracting us from reality. Without cross-checking, we’re likely to latch onto the wrong details and pull up the wrong connected web of associations in our brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also where the importance of objective data collection comes in. We can only rely on our data points for balancing evidence if they are untainted by our opinion and judgments to begin with. The art of intuition is only valuable if we stand on a foundation of good data science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the nature of good analysis and synthesis to hold opposites in tension. We live this daily when the messiness of human behavior conflicts with our clear data recording and decision making, or when the logic of structured thinking is juxtaposed with the unpredictability of obscured nuggets. Being able to work in objective facts while cultivating intuitive insights is just another skill we must balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional researchers and qualitative analysts have learned how to bridge these divides. At their core, they’re driven to understand the needs of real users. Their hunger for both accuracy and value take them beyond providing just facts and towards communicating meaningful insights. And they successfully harness both empathy and evidence to compel design teams into action, enabling the creation of truly useful products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the best way to motivate action from your research is to help your team make this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we use these same principles in our approaches, maybe one day we too will find ourselves on the other side of the desk, astounding and inspiring the next generation of researchers with all the contradictions of complex data sets and human capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How GDPR has changed the rules for design researchers]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/gdpr-design-researchers</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/gdpr-design-researchers</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For a few short weeks in mid-2018, the online world fell into a curious alignment. There was a steady stream of messages through people&amp;#39;s inboxes from every large seller, publisher, not-for-profit group, and social network they’d ever had dealings with. They were all promising that the public&amp;#39;s trust was important to them and that they had an ongoing commitment to transparency. The future of data protection seemed to have arrived. It was compelling and it was everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/&quot;&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt;, a law of the European Union that came into effect on May 25th of that year, is a nerve-wracking prospect for most organizations. It empowers individuals to control what others do with their information. It is also designed to avoid issues with traditional land boundaries thrown up by the cross-border activities of the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the threat of steep fines for violations — up to €20-million or 4 percent of a company’s global annual revenues for severe breaches —  caught the attention of a post-Cambridge Analytica world still obsessed with Big Data. Beyond the concerns about legal compliance also lurks something closer to home for businesses. The broad saturation and public awareness of the principles involved means that any breaches will measurably impact an organization’s public reputation. The net effect suggests that the GDPR is underway in becoming the de facto global standard for data privacy legislation and ethical management of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does this matter to design researchers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design researchers and UX practitioners routinely work with the kinds of personally identifying information (or PII) defined in the GDPR. The strict requirements and focus on lawful, fair, and transparent data processing have a direct impact on methodologies and artifacts we use. The two-year transition period leading to May 25, 2018, forced a rapid maturing of practices around sourcing and engaging research participants, gathering background information to help with interviews, and the management and secure storage of personal information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GDPR certainly wasn’t designed to impede ethical research. For example, the legislation is written with recognition that any type of data can be useful for research. It understands that research may require access to data for very long periods of time. It allows for personal data to be kept indefinitely, as long as it is only held for scientific, historical or statistical purposes, and on condition that legitimate justifications have been set out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do we care so much about privacy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes resulting from such a wide-reaching legal instrument also trigger an important cultural change in organizations that work in favor of design researchers. GDPR provides a huge incentive to businesses to take another look at how they interact with users. It will now be difficult for any large entity using personal data to not know what data it has, where it is held, and what it is doing with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest changes are around implementing new transparency requirements and meeting the necessary safeguards, in particular where these don’t already reflect current good research practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers are liable for data protection breaches by their employees. But sensationalizing the fines, or highlighting difficulties in achieving compliance is probably a misunderstanding of how E.U. regulators work. The GDPR &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/fines-penalties/&quot;&gt;clearly spells out&lt;/a&gt; that companies that follow the regulations, avoid intentional infringement, take measures to mitigate any damage that does occur, and collaborate with authorities will reduce the likelihood of fines. Having said that, authorities are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enforcementtracker.com/&quot;&gt;actively enforcing the regulation&lt;/a&gt;, and as of February 2020 have issued at least 168 fines totaling more than €458,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;European Union? I’m miles away! Surely I’m not affected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live and work in the E.U., it’s pretty clear that the GDPR applies to you. However, you must also comply with the GDPR if you offer goods or services to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-3-gdpr/&quot;&gt;anyone in the E.U.&lt;/a&gt;(including citizens, permanent residents, or even tourists), regardless of your location or number of employees. As websites and mobile apps are a service, and I.P. addresses are considered personal data, you’ll need to comply unless you do something drastic like put a blanket block on anyone in the E.U. using your service so you don’t collect any information from them at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What kind of personal data is regulated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/&quot;&gt;official definition of personal data&lt;/a&gt; is intentionally broad and covers any data that can be used to identify someone, even indirectly. That includes the following kinds of personal data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct and obvious things like names, ID numbers, email addresses, location information, bank details, physical description, health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less direct or obvious things, like IP addresses, behavior and activities, social media content, spending habits, cultural background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even anonymized or pseudonymized data is regulated if it’s possible to connect the dots and identify a particular individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also some additional considerations for certain kinds of information that are considered extra sensitive and, in some cases, can’t even be waived by consent. Things like racial origins, political opinions, religion, biometrics, health information, sex life, and sexual orientation. If you’re going to work with any of this prohibited data, you should talk to a legal professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is defined as ‘processing’?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing means ‘touching’ the data in any way. Article 4 defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes recording and storage of information, but also someone or something looking at that data. Scanning through a list of possible research participants to select those you’d like to speak with is, therefore, data processing. So is collating it in a spreadsheet, discussing it with your colleagues, and even inviting a participant to a study. The act of anonymizing is also classified as processing data for the purposes of the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upgrading your research practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the full GDPR requirements are pretty long and complicated, we can summarize them into a fairly typical design research process to help us see where things fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Before you start&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your first consideration needs to be getting proper legal advice.&lt;/b&gt; This should be either through your organization’s Data Protection Officer or a reputable lawyer with experience in the area of data protection and the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justify your need for any personal data you plan to collect.&lt;/b&gt; You can only collect personal data if you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/&quot;&gt;legitimate justification&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, you’ll need informed consent and are expected to use the most limited justifications possible, as well as having a relevant business need. These justifications need to be specified before you collect the data, as you’ll be using them to request consent and to plan your data collection itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get systems and processes ready.&lt;/b&gt; Prepare in advance to ensure they are ready to receive participant data and allow you to successfully deliver your data protection obligations. This includes asset storage, security, templates, consent forms, participant indexes, and ideally things like data retention policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;During Recruitment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allow prospective participants to opt-in, rather than opt-out.&lt;/b&gt; That means starting from scratch if you aren’t 100% clear about the current permissions of your lists and panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell participants explicitly why you’re collecting their data.&lt;/b&gt; This includes what you are doing with it, who you’re sharing it with, and how long you’re keeping it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Send a copy of the consent form in advance.&lt;/b&gt; You might discuss it via phone before engaging participants, or require consent as a condition for booking an interview date. Or you might simply be giving them time to read it before attending and signing in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider the age of consent.&lt;/b&gt; Article 8 of the GDPR has specific requirements for informed consent for vulnerable people, such as children. Different countries have different rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betterinternetforkids.eu/en_US/web/portal/practice/awareness/detail?articleId=3017751&quot;&gt;about the age of consent&lt;/a&gt; that must be followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Discuss consent during session introductions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long gone are the days of pre-checked form boxes and legal disclaimers buried in policies. The standard for informed consent in research involves conscientious discussion in person. This avoids a self-service, checklist approach where participants don’t give truly informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use granular consent forms that list each piece of data to be collected and processed.&lt;/b&gt; This means having a checkbox beside each item so that people can choose what they agree to. This is where limiting third-parties, and only collecting what you need to know will help you — if it’s relevant to your explained purposes, and isn’t unnecessarily collected data that might end up blocking you from engaging the participant if they disagree, then you’re on your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ensure participants understand who is doing the research.&lt;/b&gt; This means the organization benefiting from the research, as well as who is conducting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explain the purpose of the research.&lt;/b&gt; How will their participation help the research aims? What is the thing that will be created or changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be transparent about exactly who will see and handle the data.&lt;/b&gt; List every organization, including third parties, who will be involved in collecting or processing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be clear about how long their data will be retained.&lt;/b&gt; Often this is just for the period of research until the analysis has been completed, but some researchers set a blanket rule with a maximum of 1-2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get pre-approval for recording and observers.&lt;/b&gt; Get permission before pressing record on audio or video capture. Let people know if the session is being observed, and who is watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid jargon.&lt;/b&gt; Consent forms must use plain language to ensure participants are fully aware of what they are agreeing to. Any language that is industry shorthand, or even merely topic-specific, may be obscure for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep NDAs and other documents separate from consent forms.&lt;/b&gt; The aim is to keep things simple and prioritize informed consent. Keep in mind that comprehensively implementing the GDPR requirements around consent will likely produce a form with major usability issues. You’ll need to look for ways to simplify and clarify while retaining compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allow for withdrawal of consent.&lt;/b&gt; Explain that their participation is totally voluntary and that they can change their mind and withdraw permission, without needing to give a reason, and at any time, whether that is halfway through the interview, or a few months down the track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide an independent channel for complaints.&lt;/b&gt; This might be by providing the contact details of the data controller, or of the national privacy authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allow time for reflection.&lt;/b&gt; Hurrying, pressuring or encouraging people to gloss over things isn’t conducive to clear thinking. Encourage them to sit and consider things if they would like to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;During research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only collect what you need to know. Article 5 in the GDPR stipulates that personal data shall be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.” This means you should minimize the collection of unnecessary information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;After research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep a unified, protected index of participants.&lt;/b&gt; Having a single source of contact details means you don’t need to check multiple places for information to provide a copy of, correct, or delete details if participants make requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anonymize your data.&lt;/b&gt; Process everything so it can’t be used to identify people, and so that it limits the ability to be traced back to the individual (you’ll likely need to pseudonymize file names so they can be tracked by the index). Blur faces in any photos or videos that will go beyond the design team. Obscure any identifiable information entered in on-screen forms in the videos. Anonymized quotes from an interview or report, that have no identifiable information, aren’t affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure personal information is stored and processed securely.&lt;/b&gt; As the ‘controller’ determining the purposes and means of the processing, you are responsible for both how you handle it as well as anyone you pass it along to. You must vet any third-parties you’ll work with — tools, providers, partners, or anyone else. Think critically about which data needs to be passed on, when it needs to be transferred, and their own specific uses of the data in turn. Limit the number of third-parties used, and pay close attention to their privacy policies and security practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give users control.&lt;/b&gt; One of the GDPR’s main goals is to provide control for individuals about how, where, and why their data is being used. These are enshrined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-3/&quot;&gt;rights of the data subject&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a paraphrase in plain language:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to provide informed consent (see above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the participant asks, you must provide a copy of all the data you’ve collected from and about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they ask, you need to erase all of their data. They have a ‘right to be forgotten’ that includes completely removing accounts and records unless there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/&quot;&gt;valid reason&lt;/a&gt; for it to be retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they ask, you must stop processing and handling their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they say that their data is inaccurate, you have to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the person wants to move from your service to another service, you have to allow them to transfer their data out of your service in a machine-readable format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have a special right to object to their data being used for certain purposes such as direct marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organize your data for easy retrieval.&lt;/b&gt; In most cases, you have 30 days to process any of these user requests, so make it easy for yourself to accomplish them by staying organized. Standardize the way you label and name research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practice data gardening.&lt;/b&gt; Consider deleting your raw collected data after full analysis, or after a retention period of one or two years. It can be hard for acquisitive researchers to let this go, but data should be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep personal information secure.&lt;/b&gt; This requirement also includes the need for proactive monitoring for breaches, keeping records of breaches, and notifying regulators within 72 hours of a breach. It goes as far as specifying regular testing of your security measures. Security needs to be considered as part of the design process of “appropriate technical and organizational measures” and not just bolted on afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most design researchers have aptitudes that complement the intentions of the GDPR, and working in roles that advocate for product users and customers shouldn’t make the application of responsible and transparent management techniques a problem. However, GDPR factors have an opportunity to be addressed comprehensively as organizations work towards improving their research operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the rules specified by these regulations are moving beyond legal compliance and becoming widely accepted as better and more ethical practices for handling data. With the United Kingdom planning to issue their own GDPR-like legislation post-Brexit, and other countries lining up to do the same, it is a good time to start planning ahead about how your research, and your organization, can better protect personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fulfilling the principles of the European Union’s data protection regulations, design researchers can advance the organizational conversation about respectfully engaging with customers and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why we raised $4M and what we’re planning for 2020]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/why-we-raised-4m-seed-2020</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/why-we-raised-4m-seed-2020</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, Dovetail has grown to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/about/&quot;&gt;11 person team&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/customers/&quot;&gt;hundreds of customers&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, all with no external investment and no sales or paid marketing. Now, we’ve raised a $4M seed round led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blackbird.vc/&quot;&gt;Blackbird Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, with participation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.felicis.com/&quot;&gt;Felicis Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cultureamp.com/&quot;&gt;Culture Amp&lt;/a&gt;’s CEO and co-founder, Didier Elzinga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment will help us rapidly grow our team, learn from a new network of advisors and founders, and execute on our mission to revolutionize how researchers, designers, and product managers do user research within organizations worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best product for researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making sense of unstructured research data—like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/use-cases/customer-interview-analysis/&quot;&gt;interview transcripts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/use-cases/usability-testing-analysis/&quot;&gt;usability testing notes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/use-cases/survey-response-analysis/&quot;&gt;survey responses&lt;/a&gt;—is a practical problem that all researchers face, but it has a reputation for being inefficient and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2020, we’ll build on existing features like highlighting, segmentation, tag management, boards, and charts. Expect to see plenty of improvements to the analysis workflow and overall experience.&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/static/69dc68d51ac7490e892d5d9081efee89/a4b11/note-page.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll also introduce new experiences to evolve Dovetail into a world-class data analysis platform, including game-changing features for video, audio, and images, new ways to speed up analysis through automation, and better segmentation and charts to help you uncover patterns across your research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your customer knowledge base&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a collective brain for your organization’s customer knowledge: a centralized, searchable database of research and insights that the entire company leverages to make better decisions. Anyone in the organization can effortlessly uncover user research insights and explore the evidence, and the context, that led to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s talking about the need for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/user-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt;. Several companies have built their own solutions internally including &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/uber-design/the-power-of-insights-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-new-insights-platform-at-uber-26f85becc2e6&quot;&gt;Uber’s Kaleidoscope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f&quot;&gt;WeWork’s Polaris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/microsoft-design/how-microsofts-human-insights-library-creates-a-living-body-of-knowledge-fff54e53f5ec&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s Human Insights Library&lt;/a&gt;. However, there isn’t an option that’s accessible to organizations that don’t have the resources to build their own.&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/static/1a6ea9fa10b0d1d2f5d6e2e8cffa0119/a4b11/search-insights.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail will be the obvious choice for your organization’s research and insights. This year, we’ll invest heavily in ways to import data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/features/collaborative-research-ops/&quot;&gt;collaboration features&lt;/a&gt; to get everyone involved, and security and privacy to ensure your research is always safe and compliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Everyone does research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all teams within an organization conduct some form of customer research, even if they don’t explicitly call it that. Product managers interview users, designers test prototypes, salespeople talk to leads, support staff track topics, marketing facilitates focus groups, HR run feedback surveys. These teams all do it differently, often publishing mountains of data, reports, and updates across a variety of tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations are also competing more on customer experience as user expectations increase.

However, there’s one drawback: you need to decide upfront which project should house your notes, tags, and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve told us you want to be able to reorganize your projects. Now, you can move or copy research data to another project to reorganize your work, perform new analysis on the same data, or inform research happening in other teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start creating research data in any project in Dovetail, with the flexibility to reorganize your workspace structure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Copy notes, tags, and insights across projects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a copy of your notes, insights and tags into another project – simply select a note, tag, or insight and choose &lt;b&gt;Copy to&lt;/b&gt; and then select your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move notes and insights across projects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move notes and insights into another project, just select the note or insight and choose &lt;b&gt;Move to&lt;/b&gt; and select the destination project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When moving or copying a note with tags or fields, if the same tag or field already exists in the project you’re moving or copying to – we’ll automatically merge the tags and fields for you. If your note has any workspace tags or fields—the workspace tag or field will automatically be linked to the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope these features make it easier to move your work around and organize it in a way that works best for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, keep letting us know your feedback and suggestions on how we can improve Dovetail to work better for you.

Now we’re bringing fields to insights to help you better categorize your research findings and retrieve them in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store structured information about your insights to build a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/2019/ux-user-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt; that your organization can use to discover new insights and search prior research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add attributes to your insights like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impact&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Effort&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Priority &lt;/b&gt;so your team can quickly get a sense of the most critical insights to action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;b&gt;Links &lt;/b&gt;to any issues and bugs that you’ve created in your team’s development backlog in tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/jira&quot;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store &lt;b&gt;Dates &lt;/b&gt;so your team can gauge the relevance of an insight when looking back on prior research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Team &lt;/b&gt;that the insight is most relevant for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like on notes, you can filter insights in search by the metadata stored in your fields. Your team can now easily find relevant insights across projects with simple and intuitive filtering controls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As your organization conducts more research, use fields to have your insights contribute to a searchable and retrievable knowledge base of research. Create workspace fields to maintain a consistent set of fields across all of your research projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s next for insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll be working on more improvements to insights over the coming months, including improved views and ways to visualize and organize your research findings, as well as introducing new field types like selects and tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, we’d love to hear your feedback on all new features!

Even potentially great feature ideas, usability issues, or specific customer pain points get de-scoped. Sometimes an idea is just too risky or experimental, or perhaps it doesn’t quite meet the desired cost:value ratio to make it into a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal hackathons allow the team to step away from their day jobs and work on anything they like; whether it’s building a new feature, experimenting with new technology, addressing customer pain, or improving internal processes, policies, and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most startups and tech companies set aside time to run some variation of a hackathon to let people innovate on a project they’re passionate about. For our hackathon, we were inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit&quot;&gt;Atlassian ShipIt&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-hour competition, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/inside-dbx/be-a-force-for-change--hack-week-2019&quot;&gt;Dropbox Hack Week&lt;/a&gt;, a full week for the whole company to do what they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we ran our first hackathon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran our first 30-hour hackathon just before Christmas, and it was a huge success, with nine projects across the company. Here are a few tips from how we did it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give an overview in advance.&lt;/b&gt;
Not everyone on our team was familiar with how hackathons work, so we prepared the schedule and shared some information about what to expect in advance. A few people were a bit anxious about the competition, so this helped to alleviate their concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourage thinking beforehand.&lt;/b&gt;
To avoid blank canvas paralysis, we encouraged the team to start thinking about what they wanted to do and to form teams beforehand. This ensured everyone was ready to make the most of the 30 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30 hours over two days.&lt;/b&gt;
Some companies do 24 hours; others do a full week. We decided to kick-off at 10am on Thursday and finish up at 4pm on Friday, in time for pitches and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Project + pitch.&lt;/b&gt;
Over 30 hours, teams not only needed to work on their project; they also needed to create a 3-minute presentation to share what they did with the rest of the company and the judge. We asked someone from our co-working office to be a neutral judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funny prize categories.&lt;/b&gt;
To keep things interesting, Brad and I went out and bought prizes in different categories ranging from a customer value-focused prize to a best effort prize. The prizes were wrapped in wrapping paper and a complete surprise for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had nine diverse projects in total, including a well-researched proposal for employee benefits, a new feature to show invoices and receipts on the billing page, and a ‘minimize’ feature to improve navigation. Here are a few highlights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kudos &amp;amp; employee benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status:&lt;/b&gt; 🤞 Coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re a new company, without an HR / People team, so we don’t have a lot of employee benefits yet. Liz, who works in our marketing team, put together a well-researched proposal for several employee benefits including a Kudos recognition program, a gym membership, and meditation training for new hires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Edit fields on the highlights table&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status:&lt;/b&gt; 🚢 Shipped!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We released &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/capture-structured-data-with-fields/&quot;&gt;fields last year&lt;/a&gt;, which allows customers to capture and segment structured data on notes. Unfortunately, one part of this feature got de-scoped for the initial launch: being able to edit fields inline on the highlights table. Chris decided to take this on for our hackathon, and now it’s released to customers! Here’s a demo:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Downloadable invoices &amp;amp; receipts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status:&lt;/b&gt; 🚢 Shipped!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; to process customer invoices and payments. While Stripe automatically emails a receipt to the billing contact, we still get a lot of requests through support for receipts. Sometimes the contact email is wrong, the email is not sent, it goes to spam, or the person asking for a receipt is not the billing contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt and Chris worked on a project to add downloadable invoices &amp;amp; receipts. Admins can now download invoices and receipts from within Dovetail, alleviating support load. Just go to your workspace &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/settings/billing/&quot;&gt;billing page&lt;/a&gt; to see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improved website navigation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status:&lt;/b&gt; 🚢 Shipped!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (Benjamin) worked on a project to update our marketing website navigation to showcase more content and improve the experience for visitors. I designed, built, and released a new website ‘mega nav’ in 30 hours – check it out at the top of this page!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minimize modal dialogs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status:&lt;/b&gt; 🤞 Coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that during analysis, people work across multiple different notes, tags, and insights, sometimes across projects. David wanted to work on something fun and challenging to improve the experience of navigating between all of these pieces of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 30 hours, David designed and built a way to ‘minimize’ modal dialogs, which allows users to effectively ‘pin’ any note, tag, or insight to the bottom right of the screen, making them only one click away. They persist while navigating across projects, and if you leave Dovetail and come back, they’ll still be there. Here’s a demo:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think our first hackathon was a huge success! We had nine projects and managed to release four of them only a few days after it finished. The remaining five projects will hopefully be wrapped up and shipped to customers over the coming weeks. As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/company/about/&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt;, we also had a lot of fun, and we’ll aim to run these quarterly from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Top 7 user research books for beginners]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-books</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/user-research-books</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’ve surveyed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; community for books to read when you are entering the wonderful world of user research. Here are a few suggestions to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Think Like a UX Researcher: How to Observe Users, Influence Design, and Shape Business Strategy by David Travis &amp;amp; Philip Hodgson&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this list was first published, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StephanieMPratt&quot;&gt;Stephanie Pratt&lt;/a&gt;, senior user experience researcher at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gocanvas.com/&quot;&gt;GoCanvas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dav_hamill&quot;&gt;David Hamill&lt;/a&gt;, independent UX consultant highlighted that a super important title was missed entirely - &lt;i&gt;Think Like a UX Researcher&lt;/i&gt;. It was first released in January 2019 and is already making its way to the top of user researcher’s lists. According to the reviews, nothing like this book currently exists and on top of its freshness, it’s helping the readers excel at their jobs and be better user researchers. The structure of the book means that it is easy to read in different sittings or you can consume it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dav_hamill&quot;&gt;David Hamill&lt;/a&gt;, independent UX consultant says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing that sets it apart from other books on UX research is that it guides the reader in the mindset a good UX researcher has and how it applies to user centred design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User Friendly: How the Hidden Rules of Design Are Changing the Way We Live, Work, and Play by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a definite hype around this title - author Cliff Kuang is a UX designer and renowned journalist making his voice both distinct and powerful. &lt;i&gt;User Friendly&lt;/i&gt; takes the reader through the principles governing how design shapes our current behavior. It is told through the fascinating historical lens of what has gone before and how it has changed the design and human landscape forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jgebbia&quot;&gt;Joe Gebbia&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of Airbnb says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rarely do I dog-ear pages as much as I did with this book. Engrossing and rich with rarely-told stories and interviews, &lt;i&gt;User Friendly&lt;/i&gt; gives critical insights to make us better, smarter consumers of design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Interviewing Users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights by Steve Portigal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers must love it when they pick this book up and the title reads - &lt;i&gt;how to uncover compelling insights&lt;/i&gt;, indicating that the pages within will arm you with the tools you need to discover nuggets of greatness in your next interview. While interviewing is just a small part of the user research landscape, from all accounts, it is an incredibly complicated part. This book isn’t just for readers who are new to user research, the widely held opinion is that all researchers should constantly be revisiting the pages of &lt;i&gt;Interviewing Users&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xeeliz?s=20&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Churchill&lt;/a&gt;, director of user experience at Google says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Portigal’s book is packed with useful tips, illustrative examples, cautionary tales, and how-to advice for planning and conducting interviews, as well as analyzing and presenting data gathered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don’t Make Me Think, Revisited by Steve Krug&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s got to be a reason that &lt;i&gt;Don’t Make Me Think&lt;/i&gt; is constantly listed as Amazon’s Best Seller in User Experience. This book went from being purely for web designers and developers in the early 2000s to being a staple for anyone with an interest in the relationship between usability and design. If you have anything to do with a website, this is a must-read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zeldman&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Zeldman&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;Designing with Web Standards&lt;/i&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading it over a couple of hours and putting its ideas to work for the past five years, I can say it has done more to improve my abilities as a Web designer than any other book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lean UX by Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title is a fan favorite and provides an introduction to being lean and agile while simultaneously pulling it into the realm of UX. Various reviewers have indicated that while it doesn’t function as the definitive manual of how to implement Lean UX at scale, it is a foundational piece that creates a base understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/platypusguy&quot;&gt;Andrew Binstock&lt;/a&gt;, a former editor at &lt;i&gt;Dr. Dobb’s Journal&lt;/i&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short book is an excellent guide to the paradigm of UX design and implementation, presented here in an agile context that enables developers to integrate this approach into their workflow quickly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Just Enough Research by Erika Hall&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Enough Research&lt;/i&gt; is thought of as an ultra-valuable design research primer which includes user research, stakeholder research, competitive analysis etc. The sentiment is that it is jam-packed with practical tips to ensure you understand your customer and optimize your approach based on the things you discover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobulate&quot;&gt;Liz Danzico&lt;/a&gt;, VP of design at NPR says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that your business is making inaccurate assumptions about your customers’ behavior. Enough! Erika’s book makes research accessible and helps you create an informed plan to better understand—and design for—your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quantifying the User Experience: Practical Statistics for User Research by James R. Lewis and Jeff Sauro&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is not we would call a quick read but it is purportedly one of the most useful resources for quant UX researchers! &lt;i&gt;Quantifying the User Experience&lt;/i&gt; acts as a practical guide on how to use statistics to solve common quantitative problems that arise in user research. It offers functional applications and considered discussions. Philip Kortum, an associate psychology professor at Rice University:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious practitioners of usability science will find this book a valuable addition to the highly qualitative texts that are currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: The UX Research Book by Apple &amp;amp; Banana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While still untitled and yet to be released, we&amp;#39;re super excited about the upcoming book to be published by the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appleandbanana.org/&quot;&gt;Apple &amp;amp; Banana&lt;/a&gt;. The book is still a work in progress, but aims to demystify how UX research actually helps build products that customers love and practically tackles the fundamental elements of psychological, technology, and design that UX researchers employ every day at work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s already received early praise from UX professionals like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodder.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Nodder&lt;/a&gt;, who says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s a need for this book. The scope and contents are really interesting...this has the potential to be a useful entry-level handbook [for UX researchers].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renaming Discover to Home and making it more relevant]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/projects-on-discover-home-filtering</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/projects-on-discover-home-filtering</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’ve renamed our &lt;b&gt;Discover&lt;/b&gt; page to &lt;b&gt;Home&lt;/b&gt; to make it more similar to what people are used to in other products, and shipped a couple of small features to make Dovetail more relevant to you. Now, when you log in to Dovetail, or click your workspace logo in the top left, you’ll be taken to Home instead of Discover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top of Home, you’ll see a section called &lt;b&gt;Projects you’re working on&lt;/b&gt; which displays a list of projects you’ve created or contributed to in the past 30 days. The list is automatically sorted with the most recent project at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re working in a large organization, sometimes not all insights are relevant to you, especially if they come from different departments, teams, or products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now filter the list of insights shown in the home feed by various attributes including project category (e.g. department or team), project, date, and more. Any filters you add are persisted, so they’ll still be there when you come back later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just a couple of small improvements we continue to make as we learn from your feedback.

These organizations invest billions across functions like software development, IT, design, sales, marketing, and more. As these teams grow within an organization, so does the need to define processes, systems, and strategies to ensure efficiency, consistency, and quality at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen the operationalization of software development and IT teams with &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/devops&quot;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;, design teams with &lt;a href=&quot;https://designbetter.co/designops-handbook&quot;&gt;DesignOps&lt;/a&gt;, and sales teams with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-operations&quot;&gt;SalesOps&lt;/a&gt;. As organizations have realized the importance of research, and as the practice of research—particularly user and customer experience research—has matured, so has the need for processes, systems, and strategies to support the user and customer experience research function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many organizations including &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://airbnb.com/&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://deliveroo.com/&quot;&gt;Deliveroo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotify.com/&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; have individuals who specialize in operationalizing research. As more organizations hire for specialized ResearchOps roles the discipline is continues to evolve, driven significantly by the efforts of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://researchops.community/&quot;&gt;ResearchOps community&lt;/a&gt; and their work to further define the role and best practices. The community was founded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/katetowsey&quot;&gt;Kate Towsey&lt;/a&gt;, Research Operations Manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, and has since grown to over 3,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is ResearchOps?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://researchops.community/&quot;&gt;ResearchOps community&lt;/a&gt; facilitated several workshops and surveys to help define the emerging practice of ResearchOps. I quite like the definition they arrived at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ResearchOps is the people, mechanisms, and strategies that set user research in motion. It provides the roles, tools, and processes needed to support researchers in delivering and scaling the impact of the craft across an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output of their research was a map of the elements, attributes, and activities that are involved in the ResearchOps discipline (&lt;a href=&quot;https://static-assets.dovetailapp.com/what-is-researchops-map.pdf&quot;&gt;download a PDF version here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful ResearchOps function should be a force multiplier for user research – it isn’t just about making individual researchers more effective, but about leveling up how an organization does research. ResearchOps achieves this in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminating inefficiencies with research activities and implementing operational strategies to ensure research is consistent, repeatable, reliable, and high quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratizing research within an organization so that cross-functional teams are empowered to participate, collaborate, engage with, and understand customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socialize research insights so that they are accessible to an organization and that individuals make deliberate decisions informed by customer insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is ResearchOps responsible for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges and pain points that a team is facing should guide how ResearchOps focuses and operates. Depending on the size of an organization and the maturity of the research team, ResearchOps may be responsible for a variety of areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget management;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge management;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participant recruitment;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooling, physical space, and asset management;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines, templates, and documentation;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal communications; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team and people management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Governance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research activities can be a risky endeavor for organizations, especially among increasing consideration for data security and privacy legislation. ResearchOps is responsible for ensuring that data is collected, stored, and processed in a way that protects participant privacy and is compliant with relevant legislation (including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act&quot;&gt;California Consumer Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt;). ResearchOps can also be responsible for outlining the ethics and guidelines that govern how research is conducted and policies for how research data is accessed and retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Budget management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research carries a lot of operational expenses – there are fees or paid incentives for recruiting participants, ongoing costs of software licenses and tooling, travel expenses for field research, and more. ResearchOps is responsible for tracking operational spend, allocating budget and resources amongst research projects, and negotiating the necessary budget approvals within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the body of research produced by an organization grows, so does the need to have a thoughtful strategy for how research data and insights are captured, analyzed, standardized, archived, and shared. ResearchOps is responsible for driving this strategy, usually through overseeing and managing an organization’s &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/user-ux-research-repository/&quot;&gt;research repository&lt;/a&gt;, which is one central place, or source of truth, where people in an organization can go to find the latest research insights and reports from the research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Participant recruitment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all research requires the engagement of participants to act as research subjects. Depending on the nature of the research activity, sourcing participants can be an involved and time-consuming activity. ResearchOps is responsible for sourcing participants from an appropriate demographic and sample, building a pool of people willing to participate in research and facilitating scheduling and payment of incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tooling, physical space, and asset management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research sessions—especially &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/generative-evaluative-research/&quot;&gt;evaluative research methods&lt;/a&gt; like usability testing—often rely on a physical space or lab for conducting the research, available and functioning IT / AV equipment, and software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.io/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt; to record and analyze the research data. ResearchOps is responsible for liaising with other teams like IT and office experience to ensure that researchers have what they need to do their job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Guidelines, templates, and processes documentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling a research team requires guidelines, templates, and processes to ensure that research is efficient, consistent, and high quality. ResearchOps is responsible for driving this documentation and might work on producing training for teams in areas like participant recruitment, ethics, customer contact guidelines, how-to guides, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Internal communications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In large organizations with sizeable research teams, there’s often a need to communicate internally with peers and stakeholders what the research team is working on and to socialize the findings from research activities. ResearchOps is responsible for managing this communication and might take responsibility for internal email newsletters, blog posts, or monthly updates that are shared within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Team and people management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a research operations role might not necessarily have direct reports, ResearchOps may be responsible for supporting research managers and helping to upskill the research team by identifying opportunities for mentorship and training, onboarding new hires, and facilitating team offsites and internal meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to start with ResearchOps?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the research team grows and the organization does more research, so the need for ResearchOps will grow. When researchers are spending significant time on operational tasks like participant recruitment, scheduling, and budgets, instead of talking to customers, it might be time to consider a thoughtful strategy for operational work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://deliveroo.com/&quot;&gt;Deliveroo&lt;/a&gt;, ResearchOps Lead &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/saskialiebenberg&quot;&gt;Saskia Liebenberg&lt;/a&gt; describes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/deliveroo-design/introducing-research-ops-at-deliveroo-1e4deb141847&quot;&gt;need to operationalize research&lt;/a&gt; after it became obvious that researchers were only spending a fraction of their time doing actual research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at Deliveroo spend up to half of their time on set-up work like booking a venue, sourcing participants, scheduling it all in, setting up contracts and consent forms, scanning the forms after the session, …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; identified similar logistical pains affecting their research team. Research Operations Manager &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/aaronfulmer&quot;&gt;Aaron Fulmer&lt;/a&gt; discusses this in his blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/researchops-community/from-pain-points-to-empowerment-a-research-ops-evolution-8bf6f05cf99e&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s evolution of ResearchOps&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our researchers had been doing a great job multitasking, but as our operations scaled up, they had less and less time. We decided that we needed researchers to focus more on customer needs, partners, and research design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of tackling every aspect of ResearchOps, most organizations start by solving for the biggest challenges that the research team is facing. Fulmer focused Microsoft’s ResearchOps efforts on addressing their largest pain point: participants weren’t on time, studies were starting late, and there were frequent technical issues with lab spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotify.com/&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, ResearchOps Lead &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/in/lucy-walsh-999b2566&quot;&gt;Lucy Walsh&lt;/a&gt; talks about how her role shifted from handling participant recruitment to kickstarting the entire operations function in her blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotify.design/articles/2018-06-01/the-evolution-of-research-operations-at-spotify&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Research Operations at Spotify&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there is only one me, I realized that as important as it was to establish where my work started, it was also critical to have clear guardrails of where it stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains that by starting out with a clearly defined scope for the research operations function, she was able to execute on the day-to-day tasks to support research activities while also starting to work on the highest-priority process improvements, like digitizing consent forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walsh was careful not to bite off more than she could chew when starting off with ResearchOps, acknowledging that “although there were opportunity areas for expansion of ops support, this starting point was manageable with our existing resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As organizations do more and more research, so will the need for specialized individuals who can support researchers to deliver and scale the impact of their work. ResearchOps is an emerging and maturing discipline, and the role is being pushed forward by the thousand-strong passionate community of ResearchOps practitioners.

We want Dovetail to be delightful to use for teams of two to right up to teams of over 10,000, and to support volumes of data from just a handful of customer interviews, to an entire organization’s user feedback like &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/net-promoter-score-nps/&quot;&gt;NPS responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this effort, we’ve been working on a number of updates to improve usability and performance across Dovetail, and made critical workflows like tag selection, tag merging, and bulk editing as smooth as butter. We hope these improvements make Dovetail even more enjoyable to use and help you get your work done faster!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improved tag selection and menus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve overhauled the tag selection interaction, which is one of the most important features in Dovetail. Now, when you make a selection, you can easily transverse your entire tag hierarchy with &lt;a href=&quot;/help/tag-across-projects-with-workspace-tags&quot;&gt;workspace tag boards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also improved our product-wide menu system. Menus now fly-out on hover without needing to click through each item. This makes the experience consistent with what users expect in desktop operating systems like Windows and macOS, and helps to maintain context without needing to close and reopen menus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Merge tags with drag and drop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve heard your feedback about an easier way to merge tags together, and we know that refactoring and reorganizing tags is an important part of the analysis process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merging tags used to be a cumbersome interaction where you had to select all highlights on one tag, and then choose another tag to move them to. Now, you can merge tags by simply dragging one tag onto another, directly on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bulk edit usability improvements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actions for performing bulk edit operations on notes, tags, highlights, and insights are now front and center. Our new purple bulk edit toolbar makes it effortless to perform tasks like copy, move, delete, add tag, remove tag, add to insight, and more without needless scrolling or cumbersome interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also bulk select and drag notes and tags from one group to another. Just select a few notes or tags, and drag them where you want them to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/b&gt; Across Dovetail, any time you see checkboxes, try holding down the &lt;b&gt;Shift&lt;/b&gt; key to select a range of items, like in Windows Explorer or Finder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Boards are now over 300% faster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve changed how we display notes and tags on boards to improve their performance, reliability, and speed. For boards with large datasets, the result is over 300% faster dragging and over 85% less memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of showing all of the notes and tags that exist on your board, we now dynamically show only the notes and tags that are visible in your browser’s viewport. This technique is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/outsystems-engineering/virtualizing-the-virtual-dom-pushing-react-further-d76a16e5f209&quot;&gt;virtualization&lt;/a&gt;. The result is boards that now scale to thousands of notes or tags without slowing your browser down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try it today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We care deeply about making Dovetail delightful and a pleasure to use – these updates are a direct result of the feedback that you’ve all sent us, so thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These updates are out now for everyone.

Whether research is considered generative or evaluative largely depends on goals and intention of how the research is completed. Both techniques have their purpose, and there’s no “better” approach between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When organizations build products, it can be easy to get caught up in features and lose sight of what is trying to be solved. Thoughtfully employing a mixture of generative and evaluative methods can help to ensure you’re focusing on solving actual customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to understand the differences of each approach, examples of generative and evaluative research methods, and when each approach should be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is generative research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative research, also referred to as exploratory or foundational research, tries to identify or define an opportunity to solve a real human issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s typically conducted when there are no constraints. Usually, there is little or nothing known about a particular area, with the intention to introduce a solution or innovation to a customer issue – ultimately to provide a customer with something they need (even if they don’t know it yet). It’s important to keep an open mind when conducting generative research, and avoid fixating on what has already been built, or on existing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of generative research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative research methods include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diary studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field studies or contextual inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tools to help with generative research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools that help with generative research include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rev.com/transcription&quot;&gt;Rev&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful tool to use when looking into transcription and captioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collabito.com/&quot;&gt;Collabito&lt;/a&gt; helps to facilitate focus groups and discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethosapp.com/&quot;&gt;Ethosapp&lt;/a&gt; refers to itself as an ethnographer in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mural.co/&quot;&gt;Mural&lt;/a&gt; is a tool to visually collaborate, create, and organize ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; (that’s us!) can help with analyzing interview transcripts and notes from diary studies, focus groups, or field studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is evaluative research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluative research is employed when there are constraints around a topic that require validation. In most cases, evaluative research will be used to assess the success of a solution that has already been addressed in some way. Pen and paper sketches, digital prototypes, mock-up concepts, or implemented experiences could all be solutions or formats that are subject to evaluative research methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other approaches, evaluative research may be used to capture data within a framework or a set of closed questions. Using structured approaches for evaluative research can help you easily compare across segments or products, and guide decisions at all stages of the product lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As evaluative research can be conducted on solutions that can be of varying levels of fidelity and execution (from sketches to functioning solutions), evaluative methodologies play a pivotal part in the iterative development of a solution by ensuring the continual evaluation at different stages during a product’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of evaluative research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluative research methods include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerrilla, or “Starbucks” testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tools to help with evaluative research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following tools could be of help when conducting evaluative research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usertesting.com/&quot;&gt;UserTesting&lt;/a&gt; can be used to design and run moderated and unmoderated usability tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.io/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt; lets you record moderated and unmoderated usability testing sessions, and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;SurveyMonkey&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that enables you to build and circulate surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotjar.com/&quot;&gt;Hotjar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://userbrain.net/&quot;&gt;Userbrain&lt;/a&gt; both delve into usability testing by revealing the online behavior of a website user visitor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; (that’s us!) can help to analyze survey responses or transcriptions of recorded usability testing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should each method be used?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most generative research happens in the early stages of product development, which might inform project or product prioritization within an organization, whereas evaluative research typically happens to assess a potential solution or idea once it’s been designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative research occurs early in a project as a way to ensure customer problems and opportunities are understood, with the goal of informing the development of solutions that actually solve problems for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once solutions or ideas have been developed in response to generative research, that’s when evaluative research will occur to identify whether the solutions successfully solve customer problems or address opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exception to this is quantitative evaluative methodologies (such as a survey or benchmarking) which can be used throughout the entire product development lifecycle to provide generalized insights or signals to other generative or evaluative methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be intentional about selecting a method that is appropriate for your goals to ensure you&amp;#39;re able to capture meaningful and actionable insights from the research you conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning when to use different UX research methods, Nielsen Norman Group has published a comprehensive article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/&quot;&gt;when to use which research method&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Capture structured data on notes with fields]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/capture-structured-data-with-fields</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/capture-structured-data-with-fields</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s great for storing and analyzing unstructured, qualitative data. Now you can store structured attributes as well with fields on notes. Capture demographic information like name, age, location; contact details like email address and phone number; properties like persona, company, or license; and even someone’s Net Promoter Score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fields are shared across all notes in a project so you can consistently capture information across customer interviews, survey responses, or usability testing notes. You can then segment your data by field values in search and the highlights table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fields can be created with meaningful names that are specific to your research, and there are several different field types to choose from. For our first release, we’ve included several types: &lt;b&gt;Date&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Email&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;NPS&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Number&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Phone&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Text&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;URL&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feature is a direct result of feedback – you’ve been telling us how you needed a way to add structured attributes to notes, and then segment highlights by those attributes. Some customers used tags to fill this gap, however it ended up being a bit clunky. We’ve been listening! Now there’s a purpose-built feature for these attributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start using fields now to store:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demographic information &lt;/b&gt;about your users like their name, age, gender, role, and location to give more context to interviews, usability testing, and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative data &lt;/b&gt;from survey responses like and rating / by connecting apps through Zapier or importing a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact details &lt;/b&gt;like a user’s email address or phone number, along with the last time somebody from your team reached out to them, and who it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usability metrics &lt;/b&gt;from your usability testing sessions like error and success rates, time on task, or your participant’s satisfaction score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metadata &lt;/b&gt;about customer interviews, like the date, the interviewer, location, meeting room, and whether the incentive has been paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Filter by fields in search and highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segment your notes and highlights by field values with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/organize-your-data/search/#filter-your-results&quot;&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt;.

NPS has become so prevalent that it’s now reported to investors and boards alongside financial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is NPS collected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPS is collected by surveying your customers with a simple question that is answered on an 11-point scale:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a scale of 0 (not likely) to 10 (very likely), how likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of software tools available to help you collect and measure NPS. Some of the more popular tools include &lt;a href=&quot;https://delighted.com/&quot;&gt;Delighted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wootric.com/&quot;&gt;Wootric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asknicely.com/nps-software&quot;&gt;AskNicely&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://promoter.io/&quot;&gt;Promoter.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is NPS calculated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the 11-point rating that a customer responds with, they are segmented into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promoters: &lt;/b&gt;those who respond with &lt;b&gt;9 &lt;/b&gt;or &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passives: &lt;/b&gt;those who respond with &lt;b&gt;7 &lt;/b&gt;or &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detractors &lt;/b&gt;those who respond between &lt;b&gt;0 &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Net Promoter Score is calculated by &lt;b&gt;subtracting the % of detractors from the % of promoters&lt;/b&gt;. Your NPS is represented as an integer anywhere between &lt;b&gt;-100&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;100&lt;/b&gt;. The calculated score should never be represented as a percentage. Passives are always ignored in the calculation of NPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might have already gathered from these category names, &lt;b&gt;promoters&lt;/b&gt; are loyal and passionate customers who refer you to others and bring you new business. &lt;b&gt;Passives&lt;/b&gt; are indifferent – they could be happy enough, or might easily switch to a competitor. Lastly, &lt;b&gt;detractors&lt;/b&gt; are unhappy customers who are at risk of switching to a competitor, and might dissuade new potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is NPS useful and reliable?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of NPS largely depends on how consistently and reliably it is measured. There are many variables and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias&quot;&gt;selection biases&lt;/a&gt; that could affect a customer’s response and your ability to reliably measure, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;delivery method &lt;/b&gt;– surveying customers while they’re using your product (eg. in-app) vs. outside of your product or service (eg. email or SMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;relational or transactional delivery &lt;/b&gt;– surveying customers randomly vs. after they make a purchase, interact with support, or complete a usability test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;stage in the customer lifecycle &lt;/b&gt;– surveying customers who are relatively new vs. old customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;industry or segment &lt;/b&gt;– surveying customers from certain industries or segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;cadence of survey &lt;/b&gt;– surveying customers inconsistently, too frequently, or too rarely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Net Promoter system makes no recommendation on these factors – and the implementation of NPS can vary from organization to organization –  any comparison to competitors or industry benchmarks (despite their proliferance online) can be unproductive and should be taken with a grain of salt. NPS has even been co-opted to measure employee engagement and how likely employees are to recommend a company as a place to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that said, NPS can be a valuable metric to track customer loyalty and satisfaction trends over time if you can reliably and consistently deploy your survey. Over a long enough time period, NPS will serve as an important signal if customer loyalty is getting better or worse within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How should researchers and UX practitioners think about using NPS?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some in the UX community, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.uie.com/net-promoter-score-considered-harmful-and-what-ux-professionals-can-do-about-it/&quot;&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gerrymcgovern.com/measure-customer-use-of-things-not-customer-satisfaction-with-things/&quot;&gt;Gerry McGovern&lt;/a&gt;, have been critical of NPS and its methodology. However, the reality is that NPS has become the favored metric of customer-centric organizations and isn’t going away anytime soon. If measured consistently and reliably, it can be a useful metric for driving informed and positive changes for customers within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.uie.com/net-promoter-score-considered-harmful-and-what-ux-professionals-can-do-about-it/&quot;&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt; calls out, embedding NPS into qualitative research studies – like in a usability test questionnaire – may be counterproductive. For example, participants are often confused if they’re being asked to score based on their overall perception of an organization, or based on their experience testing the prototype in a usability test. Similarly, incentivized research participants could be less likely to honestly answer for fear of not being compensated. Researchers and designers should be aware that deploying NPS in this way is unlikely to yield accurate or useful results – there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-metrics/&quot;&gt;better instruments&lt;/a&gt; out there for measuring the performance of usability tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX practitioners should instead look to NPS as a useful driver for influencing stakeholders and executives to prioritize investments in improving the customer experience. Leveraging qualitative research to further understand the reasons behind an organization’s score can drive large scale change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get to the “why” behind the score?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Promoter Score by itself is crude metric – you can’t extract much meaning or rationale from a single digit (as the critics point out). All smart implementations of NPS will ask a follow up question. After a customer selects their rating from 0-10, they will be displayed a qualitative follow up question that asks &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt; a customer gave that score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the real gold of NPS is, and where researchers should focus their attention. Even critics of NPS concede that &lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.uie.com/net-promoter-score-considered-harmful-and-what-ux-professionals-can-do-about-it/&quot;&gt;the real value is in the follow up question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve started to collect follow up comments from NPS responses, it’s important to perform a thematic analysis to identify the patterns and their frequency. Depending on the volume of responses, analyzing these responses can be a time-consuming and cumbersome process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/guides/how-to-analyze-nps-responses/&quot;&gt;NPS survey tools can be integrated with Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; to help speed up your analysis and find themes quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Dovetail, you can quickly tag your NPS responses with themes and start to form groups. Other data you’ve collected in your NPS survey can also be &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/organize-your-data/structured-data-fields&quot;&gt;stored within each NPS response&lt;/a&gt;. The respondent’s score, name, email, or any other information you collect, can then be used to filter and segment your responses in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve analyzed your NPS responses, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/guides/how-to-analyze-nps-responses/#quantifying-nps-themes-with-charts&quot;&gt;charts in Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; to quantify how frequently problems or product areas are mentioned by your customers.

You can add @mentions in the body of notes, tag descriptions, insights, the project readme, and comments. Once you enter the @ symbol, you’ll be able to pick from any admin, user, or viewer in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add an @mention pretty much everywhere – even in table cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you @mention someone, they’ll receive an email notification with a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start a discussion with comments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To post a comment, click &lt;b&gt;Add comment…&lt;/b&gt; You can add comments to notes, tags, insights, and the project readme. While comments don’t have a formatting toolbar, they do support formatting through shortcuts. This means you can format your text and insert lists, links, attachments, images, and even tables in a comment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you post a comment, an email notification will be sent to the person who created what you’re commenting on. Anyone you @mention in a comment will get also get an email notification. Comment email notifications include deep links to the comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you start writing a comment and close your browser or navigate away, the draft will still be there when you come back. Comments are also realtime – if someone else posts a comment while you’re writing one, you’ll see that immediately without needing to refresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start using @mentions and comments today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both @mentions and comments are available to all customers now.

This enables you to refactor, organize, and interpret your highlights and tags across interviews, participants, survey answers, NPS responses, and any other unstructured data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, you’d need to jump into individual tags to see highlights. Now, you can easily conduct a ‘second-pass’ analysis across all highlights in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With powerful filtering, sorting, and customization options, our new &lt;b&gt;highlights table&lt;/b&gt; makes it easy to segment your data from analysis and crystallize findings into insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Filter and sort highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, the highlights table shows all highlights within the project, across tags. You’ll also see highlights here that are tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/introducing-workspace-tags/&quot;&gt;workspace tags&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Filter rules&lt;/b&gt; let you segment highlights on various dimensions. For example, you could only show highlights on certain notes in a specific note group, or only show highlights that don’t have an associated insight. Filtering is one way to create a ‘triage’ workflow to ensure that every highlight has an associated insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sort rules&lt;/b&gt; let you order highlights. For example, you could sort highlights by the date they were created to work in a chronological order, or sort by the note they’re on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Edit highlights inline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some columns on the highlights table are &lt;b&gt;inline editable&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the tags on a highlight, toggle whether a highlight is starred or not, and modify the associated insights, including creating new insights on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also change multiple highlights at once in &lt;b&gt;bulk edit&lt;/b&gt; mode. Simply select multiple highlights with the checkbox. Hold &lt;b&gt;Shift&lt;/b&gt; and click a checkbox to select a range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pin, reorder, resize, and toggle columns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control which columns are visible in the table in the &lt;b&gt;Fields&lt;/b&gt; menu. You can also reorder columns by dragging and dropping them in the fields menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pin columns&lt;/b&gt; by clicking the pin button. &lt;b&gt;Resize columns&lt;/b&gt; by dragging the vertical line at the top of the table, in the column header.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Share an exact view of highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filter rules, sort rules, and column configuration are all persisted in the URL. Share an exact view with other people by clicking &lt;b&gt;Share&lt;/b&gt; and copying the URL to the clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start using the highlights table today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highlights table is available to all customers now!

Sometimes these are isolated; other times they contribute to a larger context or shared knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail takes a project-centric approach to organizing data. This enables teams to work autonomously and maintain tag sets that are highly contextual to the work they’re doing, while avoiding the chaos of making everything ‘global’ and therefore often irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With workspace tags, researchers now have the best of both worlds. You can continue using your highly contextual project-centric tags, while also leveraging a separate set of ‘global’ tags that allow you to contribute to a shared knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workspace tags also help the team standardize sets of tags for other teams to use in their projects. Use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building up a data set to create a standard set of &lt;b&gt;personas&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking &lt;b&gt;pain points &lt;/b&gt;at the ‘platform’ level across products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributing quotes to product &lt;b&gt;feature requests&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How workspace tags work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, tags in Dovetail live in a specific project and can’t be shared across projects. This keeps things simple for most people. The architecture looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workspace tags enable you to elevate common tags out of a project so you can reuse them across projects. In the example above, we may want to pull &lt;b&gt;Personas&lt;/b&gt; out to workspace tags so we can re-use the personas tags across projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you create workspace tags, it’s only linked to your original project. You’ll need to &lt;b&gt;link it&lt;/b&gt; to additional projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside a project, nothing changes – workspace tags are seamlessly integrated with existing tags inside a project. You can create highlights like normal, choosing tags without too much thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workspace tags are ‘live’ – changes you make to these tags will immediately be reflected in all linked projects. In this sense, workspace tags in Dovetail are similar to &lt;b&gt;Masters&lt;/b&gt; in Keynote, &lt;b&gt;Symbols&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Libraries&lt;/b&gt; in Sketch, and &lt;b&gt;Components&lt;/b&gt; in Figma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Workspace tag walkthrough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the personas example above. First, we’ll create workspace tags for personas. Just like projects, workspace tags can have an icon and a readme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll create a few tags in the personas tag board that represent our personas. These tags will span across projects. They’re all orange here, but you can change the color and organize them in whatever way you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all workspace tags will be relevant to all projects in the workspace. We need to create a link between our personas tag board and the projects we wish to use personas in. Linking it to a project is as simple as clicking a checkbox and a button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once linked, the workspace tags are visible, and usable, inside the linked project. Note the sidebar shows we’re inside the ‘App usability tests’ project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’re tagging data in the project, we can choose the relevant tag – whether it’s a project tag or workspace tag doesn’t really matter. We can also create tags inside the workspace tag at this point too, assuming we have the correct permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you open workspace tags while inside a project, Dovetail adds a default filter that limits the highlights to only the ones in that project, preserving the context of the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you can remove the filter, or open the tag as a page, to see all highlights on that tag, across all linked projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Behind the scenes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding support for ‘global tags’ has been a tricky undertaking – both from a technical point of view, but also from a product design point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made a lot of assumptions about project-centricity in our codebase, which meant that tags were never meant to work across projects. This simplified things for us and made features like access control a lot easier, but we heard from customers that cross-project tags was an important missing feature. As we started working on ‘global tags’, we explored many different models for how we could solve this problem for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key consideration for us is how we balance simplicity, power, and scalability. Dovetail needs to be intuitive to new users yet feel powerful once you get to know it. We want Dovetail to work well for teams of five and teams of 500, so it has to start out basic, but not break down when you get to hundreds of users and projects, and thousands of tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truly ‘global tags’ or ‘cross-project tags’, where you can pick from any tag in any project at any time, results in a mess for large organizations. While some tags are common and should be shared across projects, many tags are specific to a particular project, and we didn’t want all users to have to search through hundreds of irrelevant tags from other projects, teams, and departments every time they make a highlight in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, we’ll release custom fields and note / insight templates, and workspace tags will help our customers standardize these features across projects, alongside tags.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[We’ve overhauled search and now it’s better than ever]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/new-search</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/new-search</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s been exactly a year since we first launched search, and now we’re back with a huge update to one of our most popular features. With a completely new interface, Dovetail’s global search is now easier and faster to use than ever before, empowering you and your colleagues to rapidly search through all the customer research you’ve ever done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Intuitive filtering and sorting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve completely redesigned how search works. Now there’s no need to remember exact project titles, group names, and tag names to filter using a convoluted search syntax. A brand new intuitive interface completely replaces our text-based query language, making it effortless to build complex queries simply by clicking and typing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve added lots of new filter options. Refine your search by combining multiple filters using &lt;b&gt;And&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Or&lt;/b&gt; logic gates and segment your data with over &lt;b&gt;16 different fields&lt;/b&gt;, including project, note board, note group, highlight count, starred, created date, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New sort controls let you change the order of results from relevance (default) to created or updated date. This means you’re completely in control of the ordering of results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your query, filter rules, and sort rules are all persisted in the URL, which makes it easy to bookmark your search for later or share an exact set of results with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Improved results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search results now maximize screen real estate and result cards have been updated to be easier to read. They now show more relevant information, including the descriptions for tags and an excerpt of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/project-readme&quot;&gt;the readme&lt;/a&gt; for project results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result cards now also show you who created notes, tags, and insights, and a list of people who contributed to projects. Hover over their avatar to see their full name and email address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results now open in a modal dialog which helps to avoid context changes and persists your scroll position on the search results screen. Browser back and forward behavior work as expected, and even in the modal dialog you can still copy the URL from the address bar to send the note, tag, insight, or highlight to somebody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More coming later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search is an important feature for Dovetail and we’re not stopping here. We have more planned including new filter fields, custom fields, file results in search, bulk edit on results, saved searches, and bulk tagging based on a search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try out the new search by clicking &lt;b&gt;Search&lt;/b&gt; in Dovetail.

One of the reasons customers love Dovetail is because we help them standardize their research structure with dedicated features like tags and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although research insights typically originate from a specific piece of work, there’s a clear need for them to be surfaced outside of the original source project. Researchers are motivated to share their insights with stakeholders to avoid their research becoming shelf-ware, and to build empathy. Stakeholders like product managers, designers, and executives are always hungry for customer insights in order to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new &lt;b&gt;Discover&lt;/b&gt; feature displays a feed of recently published insights from the research team &lt;b&gt;across all projects in the workspace&lt;/b&gt;. Insights you haven’t read yet are indicated with a pulsing red dot in the top right of the card, so it’s easy to keep track of what’s new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first step in a set of features that will improve discovery and collaboration of user research across organizations. Eventually Discover will surface more types of data like recent discussions and active projects, and over time, we will start ‘pushing’ the contents of Discover out to the organization through email notifications and weekly digests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World-class customer satisfaction, excellent support and reliability, and competitive pricing make Dovetail the obvious choice for companies looking to standardize user research and share customer knowledge across their organization. Now with Discover and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;unlimited free viewer accounts&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no better time to invite your whole organization onto Dovetail to share research insights far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mila Kuznetsova, Director of User Research at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/interview-mila-kuznetsova</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/interview-mila-kuznetsova</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (or HMH for short) is a 4,000 person education and publishing company founded 180 years ago with their headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts.

She has a background in developmental psychology and neuroscience, a Master of Education from Harvard, and has previously worked at Scholastic and New York University.&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/static/c2222e63d543e8e65456006c81d2c28a/490e5/mila.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s your organization’s mission?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; At HMH, we want to create the fullest expression of what learning can be. We combine world-class instruction, data and insight, and professional support to deliver great outcomes for our students, teachers, and learning communities. HMH is a leading provider of K–12 core curriculum, supplemental and intervention solutions and professional learning services, and readers around the world recognize and love the HMH Books and Media catalogue. I’m constantly learning about new books we publish, from the &lt;i&gt;Curious George&lt;/i&gt; series (he’s basically our mascot) to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My team is focused on the K-12 education space. We create content and learning experiences for a large share of students and teachers in the United States. With our magnitude of influence comes great social responsibility—to nurture, develop, and grow purposeful, empathetic, and determined citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does user research work across HMH?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; We have a large group of people working under the Research umbrella at HMH. We are a learning company that focuses on educational outcomes. We have psychometricians, researchers, and data scientists all looking at the efficacy of the programs we put out into the market. On top of that, we also need to make sure our offerings are engaging for students and intuitive for teachers. That’s where my team comes in. We work across departments to investigate how our products are being used in the field and we make adjustments based on that important feedback before we launch. We are also engaged in continually improving our programs and platforms once they are out in the field. More and more of my time is being spent in schools watching our materials in action and making sure they are highly relevant and applicable to different types of classroom settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can’t gamify every single math lesson, we can certainly find a happy medium where we incorporate games when students are losing steam or struggling with a concept in order to help them reengage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The User Research team is a relatively new practice within HMH, and this is reflective of larger important shifts in the learning space. More and more schools are leveraging technology or a blended approach (combining traditional print curriculum and digital solutions), and our digital footprint is quickly expanding. We are also seeing higher expectations from our users. For example, many schools are now using Google Classroom and they expect the same ease of use from us. Students also expect engaging and interactive content. While we can’t gamify every single math lesson, we can certainly find a happy medium where we incorporate games when students are losing steam or struggling with a concept in order to help them reengage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could you describe a recent user research project?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; I’m working on building a network of Learning Labs. I would classify this type of work as ethnographic research. The “Labs” are schools, camps, and other programs where we’ve developed a strong relationship with the teaching staff over time. I find that the novelty of a visitor (me) in a classroom wears off for students and instructors once you’ve been there more than a handful of times. Once you are part of the community, the people you’re observing tend to go about their day and interact with your products as they would without you there. It gives me a good sense of how they are experiencing the programs, and I sometimes do some technical troubleshooting on the spot as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of work is probably the most time consuming, but it has also allowed us to stumble upon some things that we didn’t account for in previous research. For example, teachers routinely hack the curriculum, customize their content, and incorporate elements that resonate best with their students. Every classroom you visit is totally different. The rooms are filled with artifacts that reveal how they celebrate achievements or outline the flow of the day. We want to make sure we honor and empower all the different types of teachers and create experiences that allow them to optimize the time they spend with their students. All of these activities and observations have a meaningful impact on program development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What software does your organization use? What have you tried in the past? What’s been working well?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; We have a fairly large employee base (nearly 4,000 people) in 20 cities (and home-based) and we often have lots of stakeholders participate in the planning process of our user research work. To support this model, we rely on video calls and virtual meetings for broader discussions and working sessions, and we use Slack for the more detailed work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail has made a big difference in our knowledge sharing and access capabilities for user research. We had developed a treasure trove of research over the years, and we felt somewhat limited by more traditional file sharing platforms, which essentially allowed us to put the research in one place, but not to explore and digest the information in an intuitive, user-friendly way. To ensure we all benefit from our research, we needed the search, tagging, and organization features Dovetail offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We care deeply about our content being relevant and effective, so we’ve made an effort to be out in the field as much as possible to understand how our programs are being experienced in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What challenges do you have with user research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; We face some unique challenges when it comes to user research based on the nature of the education space. Working directly with students is a big hurdle because there are fairly strict guidelines (and rightfully so) when it comes to student participation in our projects, especially when we want to work with them in-situ. We care deeply about our content being relevant and effective, so we’ve made an effort to be out in the field as much as possible to understand how our programs are being experienced in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also very important to be mindful of educators’ time. Teachers work around the clock—once class is done, they spend hours planning lessons for the upcoming day or week or grading assignments. It is not uncommon for our team to meet with a teacher at the end of the school day for an interview only to have them go right back to planning after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s changing about user research at your organization?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; Our team reflects a new and growing practice at HMH. We’re very focused on a holistic and user-centric approach to our research. We view school communities as complex systems and we approach teachers, students and education leaders with empathy. We recently conducted a comprehensive teacher ethnography study to better understand educators’ motivations, philosophies, challenges and more, and this type of research helps us gain an even deeper understanding of our users and develop profound ongoing relationships with them. We want to understand every aspect of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing we try to do is avoid DRIP (Data Rich, Information Poor). We have a relentless focus on providing relevant and actionable next steps for our product, engineering, design, and content teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also getting a better feel of our audience within HMH. I have a lot of hardworking and thoughtful colleagues who love hearing insights from the field so we’re expanding our reach within the company. We have a dedicated Slack channel where we post findings and have created short one-pager documents to share insights in a quick and concise manner. One thing we try to do is avoid DRIP (Data Rich, Information Poor). We have a relentless focus on providing relevant and actionable next steps for our product, engineering, design, and content teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do you do what you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; To put it simply, I love what I get to do each day. I’ve been in the education space in different roles for my entire career. I worked at a university, in the department of education for a major city, and now in curriculum development and edtech. I care deeply about making our programs relevant and efficacious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the pace of the work and the impact we have on learners, and I know colleagues throughout the company feel the exact same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone in our organization has been very responsive to the insights our team brings back as a result of our field research. It’s also a sweet spot to be in because although I sometimes have to be the bearer of bad news, you can’t really argue with what our users are telling us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Any advice for new user researchers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mila:&lt;/b&gt; My advice would be to find a field you love and then figure out a way to break into it. I didn’t know much about user research when I graduated from college with a focus on developmental psychology and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my first jobs was working as a researcher at a university. I spent years in the classroom doing observations, interviews, and tests. At some point I became involved in modifying and developing the protocols for our research projects. It always surprises that there can be a divide between research and practice, and I met PhD students who preferred not to visit our research sites or do any of the tests with users. I couldn’t imagine not interacting with practitioners and students! I love being in the field and this experience made me realize that maybe the ivory tower wasn’t exactly for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my university days, I spent time working on teacher professional development and curriculum implementation. These experiences allowed me to see many different angles of teaching and learning. I’ve always had a lot of empathy for teachers and students, but collectively my experiences have allowed me to understand how we can improve some of the processes they use each day and to think more strategically about our users’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m friendly and upbeat, but it’s still intimidating for a four-year-old to hang out with a grownup they don’t know very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, and I can’t stress this enough, know your audience! The university research projects I worked on were based in preschools and kindergarten classrooms. I’m friendly and upbeat, but it’s still intimidating for a four-year-old to hang out with a grownup they don’t know very well. Simple things can make a big difference and help you connect with your audience. For example, I got a pair of purple glitter Converse as a gift from a friend and decided to wear them on a site visit. They were a hit! The shoes were an amazing conversation starter and made the sessions seem less serious and more fun and engaging for the kids. I wore those shoes into the ground and eventually had to retire them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Better navigation and layout options in Dovetail]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/better-nav</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/better-nav</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Usability is a huge focus for us. Navigation is a fundamental part of the user experience, so we’re always looking for ways to improve navigation in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we’ve made several iterations to our core navigation since we launched, we still receive feedback that people lose their context when opening things. It’s accurate – when you open a note, the context of the board disappears. When you open a search result, you lose your scroll position when you go back to the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Modal dialogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when you click on a note, tag, or insight, it will first &lt;b&gt;open in a modal dialog&lt;/b&gt;, preserving the context and your scroll position behind the dialog:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better support modal dialogs, we’ve also updated the our editor formatting toolbar. It’s now horizontal. Not only does this fit better inside a dialog, but it’s also more consistent with tools like Confluence and Google Docs, reducing the learning curve for new users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want a full page? Click &lt;b&gt;Open in page&lt;/b&gt; to open the note, tag, or insight as a page. The cool thing about this is that if you then click on a tag, the tag will open in a modal dialog so you don’t lose your place in the (full page) note!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resizable tag gutter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another popular request is to be able to resize the tag gutter on a note. Now if you have long tags, you can just drag the line to make the tag gutter wider or narrower. The percentage width is saved for you so you won’t have to change it for every note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Full width mode&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, if you’re truly brave, go full width to maximize space for your content and tags! Just open the &lt;b&gt;Actions (···)&lt;/b&gt; menu and toggle &lt;b&gt;Full width&lt;/b&gt; on or off. This setting is also saved across notes and across projects, but just for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Editable toggle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, our new &lt;b&gt;editable toggle switch&lt;/b&gt; lets you disable editing on the readme page along with notes, tags, and insights. This setting is persisted for everyone, so it’s great for preventing your colleagues from accidental ‘fat finger’ moments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these features are available to all customers now. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Add more hierarchy in a project with multiple boards]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/multiple-boards</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/multiple-boards</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some of our customers have very large projects with a lot of data and a lot of tags, and one thing we’ve heard from them since we launched projects is that there’s not quite enough hierarchy inside a single project for projects to scale to thousands of items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multiple boards&lt;/b&gt; introduces another level of hierarchy in projects and gives you a new way to organize your data. Like sheets in a spreadsheet or tabs in your browser, boards can simply be rearranged with drag and drop:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can create boards on the &lt;b&gt;Data&lt;/b&gt; page to organize your data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…and on the &lt;b&gt;Tags&lt;/b&gt; page, to organize your tag groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course you can move groups between boards inside a project. Simply open the group’s &lt;b&gt;Actions (···)&lt;/b&gt; menu and click &lt;b&gt;Move to…&lt;/b&gt; to select a board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boards also show up in breadcrumbs everywhere, and you’ll be able to filter your data and tags by boards in upcoming improvements to our search user interface. Lastly, multiple boards paves the way for &lt;b&gt;global tags&lt;/b&gt;, another feature we’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Visualize your user research with our new pie chart, treemap, and radar chart!]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/pie-treemap-radar-charts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/pie-treemap-radar-charts</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visualize your research project with 24 new, unique combinations of charts with a new pie chart, treemap, and radar chart.

See a pie chart of your tags or a roll-up of tag groups across three different metrics: &lt;b&gt;highlight count&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;note count&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;tagged text volume&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treemap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for a different way to visualize your data? The treemap gives you a colorful and space-efficient way to compare values for one of the following metrics: &lt;b&gt;highlight count&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;note count&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;tagged text volume&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Radar chart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The radar chart gives you yet another way to compare values for one of the following metrics: &lt;b&gt;highlight count&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;note count&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;tagged text volume&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a bit of an experiment so we’d love to hear your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bar chart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all of the charts above, the bar chart lets you compare the following metrics: &lt;b&gt;highlight count&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;note count&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;tagged text volume&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other improvements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also made several other improvements to our charts feature:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added values to the legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added hover tooltips to all charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added animations to all charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added breadcrumbs to act as the chart title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated the behavior so all items are selected by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved the usability of the filter legend including ‘Show all’ checkboxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved accessibility and keyboard interaction of the filter legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved the layout for charts on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved cross-browser compatibility of charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try it out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just click &lt;b&gt;Charts&lt;/b&gt; in the sidebar, then click &lt;b&gt;Chart&lt;/b&gt; in the top right to choose a new chart.

Feel free to collaborate with other users and you’ll see their changes without needing to refresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From now on, when new people open your project for the first time, they’ll start at the readme. This makes it the ideal place to cover things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research project goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your hypotheses or assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your research plan and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background on the data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feature is a direct result of observing how customers use Dovetail.

I have one word of advice: talk to your users. Building a new product from scratch is hard (believe me!), but thankfully early adopters are often super willing to give you feedback. As a founder, you should aim to get their feedback as often as possible while you’re in the early stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few suggestions and lessons from how we do it at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Prominently show a feedback button in-product&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuck a feedback button somewhere in your product and aim to strike the balance between in-your-face &lt;b&gt;SEND FEEDBACK&lt;/b&gt; and completely hidden in a menu. Don’t just pop a feedback dialog randomly – most of your feedback will be “how do I get rid of this annoying feedback dialog?” We iterated on this a few times in Dovetail and ended up with a button in the bottom of our sidebar. It’s easy to find, it’s on every page, and isn’t intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how to implement the button – there are plenty of products around that can do this. NPS products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asknicely.com/&quot;&gt;AskNicely&lt;/a&gt; will show surveys in-product where you can collect feedback, and of course, there are chat apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://intercom.com/&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira&quot;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt; has a (not very well known) feature called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/using-the-issue-collector-776636529.html&quot;&gt;issue collector&lt;/a&gt; which you can embed in a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we set up our own form which posts to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.frontapp.com/t/h429xa/how-to-set-up-a-form-inbox-in-front&quot;&gt;Front form inbox&lt;/a&gt;. This means user feedback goes directly into our support system so we can respond if necessary. We then save all feedback in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; for storage and analysis, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Configure automatic feedback prompts via email&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve had good success with automated emails that prompt users for feedback. One of them is sent to users who have performed a key action (in our case, adding a highlight) in the past 30 days, with the simple subject line &lt;b&gt;Feedback?&lt;/b&gt; The other automated email is sent to people who didn’t convert after their free trial with the subject line &lt;b&gt;Let us know why you didn’t upgrade&lt;/b&gt;. In both cases, the email will be sent at most once to ensure users don’t get continually bombarded with requests for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Products like &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixpanel.com/&quot;&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitally.io/&quot;&gt;Vitally&lt;/a&gt; let you automatically send emails based on user behavior (or lack of). These emails can be triggered by specific actions, or manually sent to a customer / user segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, we had plain text emails that pretended to be manually sent by me. I think most of our users see through these ‘pretend’ personal emails so we ended up just making them look like our regular ones. That didn’t change much – I think the copy is more important than the template or whether it looks automated or not. Here’s an example of what the email looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Setup feedback-orientated social media pages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media isn’t so hot right now (sorry Zuck), but don’t be turned off by the idea of setting up a page or forums for user feedback in public places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook Groups&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discourse.org/&quot;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt;. Also, get involved in discussions about your product on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hidovetail&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://linkedin.com/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t really maintain our Facebook page but we do try to chat with users on Twitter as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring social media and forums is a great way to stay close to what people really think about your product. Also, public content, discussion, and testimonials about your product adds an additional layer of social proof for potential leads to discover. Win, win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Create a Slack community and encourage users to join&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;public Slack community&lt;/a&gt; and welcome all of our users to join via links in the welcome email, on our website, and in-product. This has been a fantastic way for us to engage with users, get to know them, and of course, get great feedback. But don’t just create a new Slack and start setting up channels without a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about what sort of feedback you’re after, how customers interact with your product, and how having them signed in to your Slack workspace can facilitate that. Consider setting up automated bots to welcome people to the workspace and explain where to post what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Create dedicated channels in your Slack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, using Slack can be a great way to get quality feedback. We set up dedicated &lt;b&gt;#feature-requests&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;#support&lt;/b&gt; channels so that customers know where to go. If you don’t do something like that, we found that users will take things into their own hands and start choosing an array of channels to post their feedback or questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack has also enabled us to have live and personalized conversations with customers. This is really only possible for a while before it becomes unscalable, so make good use of it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete list of public channels we have in our Slack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#feature-requests &lt;/b&gt;– a place for users to post feature requests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#general &lt;/b&gt;– general discussion about Dovetail, maintenance notifications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#interesting-articles &lt;/b&gt;– a place to share blogs and articles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#introductions &lt;/b&gt;– a place to introduce yourself to the community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#support &lt;/b&gt;– ask questions and get help with Dovetail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Add an NPS tool like Delighted or AskNicely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/net-promoter-score-nps&quot;&gt;Net Promoter&lt;/a&gt; tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://delighted.com/&quot;&gt;Delighted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asknicely.com/&quot;&gt;AskNicely&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://vitally.io/&quot;&gt;Vitally&lt;/a&gt; helps you track user satisfaction over time with a quantitative score called NPS. Make sure you find a timely moment to show the survey or email it to users. Otherwise, as I mentioned above, you’ll get feedback like “how do I get rid of this annoying feedback dialog?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the NPS score itself is interesting and great to track over time, the real data lies in the free-text, qualitative information you get from users answering the second, and most important question in an NPS survey: “What is the reason for this score?” &lt;b&gt;Answers to that question will actually help you improve your NPS score, rather than just look at it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Store and analyze user feedback with Dovetail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collecting feedback is only half the battle. If you collect user feedback, but don’t read or analyze it, then you’re completely missing the picture. &lt;b&gt;Feedback isn’t useful unless you read it, categorize it, and share it with other members of your team.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick plug – &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; helps you make sense of all of the qualitative user feedback data you’ve collected (like NPS survey responses) with easy-to-use features to help you and your team categorize the data, identify patterns, and quantify recurring themes. You could use spreadsheets or sticky notes, but that’s definitely doing it the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dovetail you can quickly highlight and tag user feedback:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And search across all of your feedback to easily find things later:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail is also cloud-based and collaborative which makes it super easy to share user feedback, customer research, and insights with the rest of your team or clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/auth/signup/&quot;&gt;Start a free trial →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Prompt people to give feedback at the end of demos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the early stages of developing a new product, then you’re probably giving customer demos. After a demo, your product is fresh in your prospective customer’s head and they’re aware of its features and its shortcomings. Have a plan for how you’re going to capture this feedback because sitting there and just listening isn’t as valuable as capturing the recording or at least a few notes to analyze and share with your team later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are recording demos, ask for permission to record at the beginning. We recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://rev.com/&quot;&gt;Rev&lt;/a&gt; to transcribe audio / video recordings. If you’re not recording your demos, take lots of notes and document all feedback and feature requests. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;’s great for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Share early designs or wireframes with users&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During development, designers and developers can get too close to the product and may struggle to see the wood for the trees. The best way to combat this is to get everyone in front of users as early and as often as possible during the design / development phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Dovetail, we’re extremely lucky. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/customers&quot;&gt;researchers, designers, and product managers as our core users&lt;/a&gt;. They tend to give great product feedback since they’re usually building products themselves!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often have video calls with users on Google Hangouts Meet where we walk through early designs and prototypes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchapp.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes we even hold literal sketches up to the camera. We also do this in customer demos – we try to be transparent with upcoming features and want to get as much feedback as possible from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Call your most active customers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, use the phone. Sometimes the best way to get feedback is to get on the phone and start dialing. I know, in the world of low-touch SaaS, phoning your customers is a scary option, but it’s often appreciated by customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t put someone on the spot. Open up lightly with the intention to schedule the call at another time. Normally customers will give you five minutes there and then, so, as always, be prepared. Have a script and ask if would be okay to record the conversation or at least take notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap up – nothing I’ve mentioned above is a particularly innovative idea to capture user feedback. Nor do you need to implement every single technique. Choose a few of the techniques that resonate with you the most, then do it. Talking to your customers and understanding their needs is the most effective way to build a great product.

When public access is enabled, all published insights in the project will be available to anyone who has the link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with our recently released multiple workspaces feature, Dovetail is now better than ever for agencies and consulting firms who work with more than one client at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable public access to insights for a project, navigate to that project, click &lt;b&gt;Insights&lt;/b&gt;, then click &lt;b&gt;Share&lt;/b&gt; near the top right corner of the screen. A dialog will open and you can toggle public insights on or off:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copy the link in the dialog and send it to whoever you like&lt;/b&gt;. When they visit the link, they’ll see an overview of all published insights in presentation mode, and be able to navigate through the insights at their leisure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone clicks an insight or starts to navigate through all of the insights with the left (←) or right (→) arrows, they’ll be able to read a single insight and scroll down to see the &lt;b&gt;references&lt;/b&gt; (user quotes, notes, tags, or media) that support the insight:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights public access is available to all customers now.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Switch between multiple workspaces using a single user account]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/switch-multiple-workspaces</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/switch-multiple-workspaces</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Agencies and consulting firms love Dovetail for working with their clients and stakeholders, however, up until now, it’s been pretty painful to work with multiple clients at once while keeping everybody’s data separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve completely rewritten the way workspaces and users interact. Now a single user account (e.g. jane@piedpiper.com) can belong to multiple workspaces at the same time—and switch between them instantly—without having to log in or log out. Project data, users, and billing are completely separate between workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also released two other features to help customers manage their workspaces:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now set more than one person as the admin for a workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add multiple allowed domains for domain-restricted sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on for more details about these new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manage your workspaces&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you log in to Dovetail, you can now click on the &lt;b&gt;workspace name&lt;/b&gt; in the top left corner of the screen to instantly switch workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you click &lt;b&gt;Join or create workspace&lt;/b&gt;, you’ll see the current workspaces you’re in, other workspaces you’re eligible to join, and any pending invites for workspaces that you can accept or dismiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/manage-your-account/multiple-workspaces&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make other people admins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail now supports multiple admins which means more than one person can manage users in the workspace. As an admin, just open the &lt;b&gt;Actions menu (···)&lt;/b&gt; next to a user and click &lt;b&gt;Convert to admin&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/manage-your-workspace/users&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add more than one allowed domain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now add more than one allowed email address domain for domain-restricted sign up. Domain-restricted sign up lets people join your workspace without needing an explicit invite, providing they have the correct email address domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/manage-your-workspace/domain-restricted-sign-up&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these features are available in Dovetail now.

With our new insights feature, you can easily:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summarize &lt;/b&gt;your project by embedding references to relevant evidence like notes, tags, quotes, and media from your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Standardize &lt;/b&gt;how your organization stores, presents, and searches for user research insights across current and historical projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save time &lt;/b&gt;by avoiding the need to copy and paste data from Dovetail into slideshows and reports that you need to design from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share &lt;/b&gt;user research insights with others in a simple, attractive format, including with people who don’t have a Dovetail account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Present &lt;/b&gt;user research insights on the big screen with our new fullscreen presentation mode and quick keyboard navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feature overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights are now in top-level project navigation next to &lt;b&gt;Data&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt;. By default, they are presented in a newspaper-style layout with large images, excerpts, author avatars, and publish dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can rearrange each insight so the most important ones are at the top of the page, and if you prefer lists, you can toggle between grid and list layouts by clicking the button in the top right corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual insight is sort of a hybrid between a blog post and a slide in a Powerpoint deck. You can write about your insight like normal, but the focus is on inserting &lt;b&gt;references&lt;/b&gt; to data in your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now you can embed highlights, notes, and tags, and media like images, audio, and video files. We’ll add more reference types as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/organize-your-data/search&quot;&gt;our query language&lt;/a&gt; to filter your results and find the right references to embed in your insight. Also, references don’t have to be from the same project — you can embed data from other projects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cover images&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insight cover photos give you a quick way to make your insight more visual. You can upload your own image as a cover photo or search for one from thousands of free photos using our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Publishing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishing an insight will make it read only and show it in presentation mode. In addition, when you publish an insight, it will trigger the ‘New Insight’ trigger in &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/dovetail/integrations&quot;&gt;our Zapier integration&lt;/a&gt;. The ‘New Insight’ trigger lets you set up neat workflows like automatically sharing published insights to Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have some more plans for the publishing feature. In the future, published insights will be sent to people who are watching the project, and they’ll be included in an email digest for all users in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Presentation mode&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presentation mode is a bit like a slideshow. It’s a way to share your insights in a focused, fullscreen experience, with large font sizes and a horizontal carousel where you can move between insights with the arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Insights in search&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While insights belong to a project, they will be surfaced in search so you can see a list of insights across all projects. References are also cross-project which means you can insert references to data in other projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can quickly share an insight with multiple people at once by sending an email using our new &lt;b&gt;Share via email&lt;/b&gt; feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, with project public access enabled (coming soon), people will be able to view a project’s insights in presentation mode even if they don’t have a Dovetail account. This is ideal for sharing your research insights and findings with stakeholders or external clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start using new insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New insights are available for everyone now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply log in, open a project, and click &lt;b&gt;Insights&lt;/b&gt; in the sidebar to get started. If you have legacy insights, you’ll be prompted to migrate them to new insights or to tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning for insights. We’re excited about the potential for this new feature, and we can’t wait to hear your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meet the new Dovetail: updated navigation, features, and logo]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-updated</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/dovetail-updated</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today we’re launching some new stuff. The most noticeable is a new sidebar navigation and updated terminology to make Dovetail more intuitive, along with a few new features like project categories and templates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also changing our logo. Read on to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New navigation and terminology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new sidebar is available across all pages which makes it easier to move around quickly. Every action now has a label, instead of just an icon, which makes Dovetail easier to use. And if you prefer more horizontal screen real estate, then the sidebar can also be collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We noticed a lot of new users were struggling with abstract terms like teams, members, notes, and tags. To address this we’ve renamed a few things with more meaningful language, and we have modified our information architecture so projects are more self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’ve changed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team &lt;/b&gt;becomes &lt;b&gt;Workspace &lt;/b&gt;– A collection of users and projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Member &lt;/b&gt;becomes &lt;b&gt;User &lt;/b&gt;– A person who has access to the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some new terms we’ve introduced:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data &lt;/b&gt;– raw research data including notes, images, audio, video, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis &lt;/b&gt;– this is where you’ll find your tags, insights, and charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New features&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Project templates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/static/4309f41d3b463d9be86d6ed548f18c58/a4b11/templates.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve released a new templates feature that lets you create and manage shared project templates for the rest of your workspace to use when starting a new project. Templates are great if you want to re-use a set of tags between projects, or standardize your project structure!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/the-basics/project-templates&quot;&gt;Learn more about templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Project categories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now organize projects into categories on the projects screen with drag and drop reordering. This is very useful if you have lots of projects and need to organize them by team, department, method, or status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/the-basics/create-project&quot;&gt;Learn more about organizing projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Project and workspace icons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personalize your projects with one of 20 colorful icons, and brand your workspace by uploading your company logo and setting the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trash&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accidentally deleted something? Now you can restore anything you delete for up to 30 days in the workspace or project trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dark mode&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night owl? You can now toggle dark mode in your user profile. If you’re using a browser that supports OS-level dark mode, then you’ll find it’s enabled automatically based on your OS setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Settings screens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our menus were getting overloaded so we’ve moved some actions into two settings screens – one for the workspace which contains users, billing, and templates, and one for projects which has project actions to archive, delete, manage access, export, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Transfer admin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workspace administrators can now transfer the admin to someone else in the workspace without needing to contact us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/faq/workspace-admin&quot;&gt;Learn more about transferring admin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New logo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did like our old logo, however it had a few issues: the bird metaphor wasn’t related to our product, it was difficult to draw, didn’t fill a square, and the all-lowercase wordmark introduced ambiguity around capitalization. Is it “dovetail”, “Dovetail”, or heaven-forbid, “DoveTail”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We worked with Sydney-based designer &lt;a href=&quot;https://alfsalib.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred Salib&lt;/a&gt; to come up with a new metaphor and logo for Dovetail. We feel our new logo better represents our product (the unification and storage of different data), it’s much easier to draw, is a bit colorful, looks great on dark and light backgrounds, fills a square, and clearly shows how to capitalize our name (it’s “Dovetail”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coming soon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Highlighting improvements (in beta now)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working on a new highlighting interface and some technical changes to address longstanding usability pain points with highlighting. You can try it out now by &lt;b&gt;enabling beta features&lt;/b&gt; for your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New insights (February)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been listening to all of your feedback about insights over the past 12 months, with the main point being that they’re confusingly similar to tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We agree. We’re working on a completely new experience for insights that will be distinctly different from tags. This new feature will focus on helping you summarize and share your research findings. You’ll no longer be able to highlight with insights – instead there will be a better way of creating insights and referencing data in your project than highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the time comes, everyone will get to decide whether they want to migrate existing insights to our new insights, or to tags, on a per-project basis. Stay tuned for more information over the coming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Further navigation improvements (March)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still have some work to do on navigation. We will be making it easier to navigate quickly between notes or tags within a project, and we’ll improve our new navigation on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Transition process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Availability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new navigation and new features listed above are available by default for everyone right now. You don’t have to do anything except log in!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to try out our new highlighting interface, all you need to do is enable beta features for your workspace and refresh. We’re hoping that our new insights feature will be available in beta in early February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help&quot;&gt;help documentation&lt;/a&gt; has been updated to reflect the new navigation and terminology, and we’ve also improved the look of articles in general. We’ll continue improving our docs over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Looking forward to 2019—our goals and our plan to get there]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/looking-forward-to-2019</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/looking-forward-to-2019</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;2018 was a huge year for us! &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/roadmap&quot;&gt;We shipped a lot of features&lt;/a&gt; and matured the product past its initial MVP state. We established a real business with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/customers&quot;&gt;hundreds of paying customers&lt;/a&gt;. Brad and I moved out of our homes and into an office, and we made our first hire, Chris. To learn more about our past 12 months, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/reflecting-on-2018&quot;&gt;Reflecting on 2018 — what we achieved, learned, and struggled with while starting our startup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019 we will be focusing on nailing our core and scaling up to become &lt;b&gt;the obvious user research platform for businesses&lt;/b&gt;, like how Slack is the obvious chat tool for teams. What is a user research platform? For us, this means a cloud service for researchers, designers, and product managers that stores user research data, helps you analyze it collaboratively, summarize it for stakeholders, and gives the whole organization the ability to leverage past research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get there, we’ll be tackling the following themes of work: &lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Everyday Experience&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Collaboration&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Scale&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Operational Excellence&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal:&lt;/b&gt; Deliver a world-class qualitative data analysis experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Core conceptual model. &lt;/b&gt;Users have told us that teams, projects, notes, tags, and insights can be confusing. We’ll improve our terminology and conceptual model to better match people’s expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlighting workflow. &lt;/b&gt;Highlighting and tagging in Dovetail should feel fast and powerful, like an IDE does to developers. We’ll make highlighting and tag management feel great to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New insights. &lt;/b&gt;A new insights experience will do a better job of helping you summarize your project, reference data from your analysis, and create a beautiful set of findings to share with stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond text. &lt;/b&gt;Research data comes in many forms. We’ll branch out and introduce simple, intuitive new tools for you to highlight and tag images, audio recordings, videos, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New ways to segment data. &lt;/b&gt;Customers have asked for the ability to insert metadata in notes so they can better segment data. We’ll release a new feature called ‘properties’ which will let you do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Everyday Experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal:&lt;/b&gt; Squash everyday pain points to make Dovetail a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple navigation and information architecture. &lt;/b&gt;New users have told us they have a hard time understanding where everything is and how features relate to one another. We’ll release our new design with a new navigation experience and improved information architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Search improvements. &lt;/b&gt;Search is extremely important for us to nail the self-serve ‘research repository’ use case. Expect to see new features like saved searches, search history, more querying options to filter results, and an easy-to-use query building user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tools for data organization. &lt;/b&gt;It should feel effortless to organize your data in Dovetail. New features will help you manage data in your workspace, like tools to copy, move, rename, and delete multiple things at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal:&lt;/b&gt; Make Dovetail the best place to share user research with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real time improvements. &lt;/b&gt;All data in Dovetail should update in real time for everyone without needing to refresh. A new technical approach to how we handle real time subscriptions will make this a reality in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collaboration features. &lt;/b&gt;We’ll release collaboration features like inline comments on notes and insights, @mentions for bringing people into a conversation, push and email notifications, and opt-in email newsletters that automatically summarize the latest research insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easier sharing. &lt;/b&gt;We know that getting your research data and insights in front of stakeholders is important. New sharing features like public links with guest access and a ‘Share to Slack’ integration will make this easier than ever, even for people without a Dovetail account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal:&lt;/b&gt; Handle more scale in the product, in engineering, and in our business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product scale. &lt;/b&gt;We’ll begin efforts to scale our feature set to accommodate larger organizations with new features like multiple workspaces, project categories, workspace permissions, two-factor authentication (2FA), activity feeds, and bulk user management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Backend scale. &lt;/b&gt;We’ll continue making improvements to our backend infrastructure so we can keep Dovetail fast for all customers without racking up huge infrastructure costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pricing scale.&lt;/b&gt;We will continue improving our billing system, keeping it easy for customers to manage their own subscriptions. We’ll introduce pricing that scales based on user count, so smaller organizations with less users will pay less and larger organizations with more users will pay more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Operational Excellence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goal:&lt;/b&gt; Provide a smooth end-to-end experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deliver great support. &lt;/b&gt;Recently we moved to a shared inbox for support along with a dedicated support rotation. Last year we also introduced our public Slack community for users. We’ll continue to improve our support processes to ensure smooth sailing for us and a great experience for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improved developer experience. &lt;/b&gt;We’ve spent a lot of time improving our developer experience so we can continue moving quickly and easily onboard new developers throughout the year. We’ll continue working on engineering health and developer experience to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grow our team. &lt;/b&gt;We hope to grow our team from 3 people to 7 people by the end of 2019. This is based on revenue growth and no external investment. If we do raise external investment, then we will grow our team faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all of our customers, friends, and family who have helped us get this far. We really appreciate it. 2019 is going to be a huge year for us and we’re counting on your support again.

Now we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/customers&quot;&gt;hundreds of happy customers&lt;/a&gt;, thousands of active users, a deeper understanding of the problems we’re solving, a larger development team, and a much more functional (and valuable!) product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t have any experience doing this before. We also didn’t have any, advisors, investors, or mentors. We simply tried to follow an iterative process of listening to our customers, learning, and improving the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 2018 behind us and 2019 ahead, we thought it would be a good exercise to summarize the things we did consistently; both as a record for ourselves, and in case there’s something useful here for other founders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we whittled the list down to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning from our users&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focusing on a specific problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritizing with principles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Learning from our users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; users are researchers, designers, and product managers. This is helpful for us: people in these roles know how to give great feedback and targeted product suggestions. They understand the challenges with product development since they have their own firsthand experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad and I aimed to establish close relationships with early users when we started working on Dovetail. Naturally we wanted to hear their feedback on what we were building, but since neither Brad nor myself are researchers, we were also keen on uncovering new problems for us to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more successful ways we’ve been staying in touch with our users is through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;public Slack community&lt;/a&gt;. This was a bit of an experiment and we weren’t sure if anyone would bother to join, however, over time, the community has grown, and it has enabled us to have ongoing conversations with a small collection of smart people around the world. This rapid feedback loop has been hugely beneficial for our product development; people aren’t afraid to ping us directly with bug reports, and we often drop design mockups for upcoming features or questions we have to spark conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also communicate with users regularly in-person, over video chat, through our in-app feedback form, and on Twitter. We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; to store all of this data in Dovetail, where we categorize it with tags. This helps us uncover patterns, quantify feature requests, and track pain points over time. It also means we have an easy-to-access repository of contextual user feedback and research data that we can refer back to whenever we start work on a new feature or begin to improve an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have a meeting or video call, we often show design mockups and concepts for new features. We let users know when we launch something in beta and look forward to their thoughts. When they encounter bugs that are easy to fix or have straightforward feature requests, we try to act as quickly as possible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hidovetail/status/1056368008661102592&quot;&gt;Often we release a new feature just hours after someone asks for it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also visited our customers in Sydney or invited users into our office for co-design workshops. Our users helped us design new features and make decisions about their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our transparent communication, strong relationships with users, and rapid execution meant that early users started to trust that we were competent enough to solve their problems and execute well on new features. Even if the product didn’t do what they wanted it to do at that moment, early users understood we would get to it one day and execute well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on a specific problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our original mission statement was to help teams store, organize, and analyze both customer feedback data (like survey responses, tweets, support tickets, and in-app feedback), along with user research data (like interview transcripts, usability testing notes, photos, and videos).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We felt there was value in having customer feedback and user research data in the same place, and that the use cases were similar enough that a single product could tackle both. The reality is that the features required to analyze and organize customer feedback is very different to user research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback is &lt;b&gt;high volume &lt;/b&gt;(thousands of items) whereas user research is typically &lt;b&gt;low volume &lt;/b&gt;(dozens of items).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback is &lt;b&gt;short-form &lt;/b&gt;(hundreds of characters) whereas user research is &lt;b&gt;long-form &lt;/b&gt;(thousands of characters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback is best analyzed &lt;b&gt;automatically &lt;/b&gt;due to the volume, whereas user research can only be analyzed &lt;b&gt;manually &lt;/b&gt;(with current technology).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback is &lt;b&gt;constantly arriving&lt;/b&gt;, with no end in sight, whereas user research projects &lt;b&gt;finish &lt;/b&gt;at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback typically originates in other tools, and so is &lt;b&gt;heavy on integrations&lt;/b&gt;, whereas user research is &lt;b&gt;less reliant on integrations&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We realized we were building one product to do the work of two&lt;/b&gt;. On top of this, the customer feedback market is extremely competitive, and we knew we couldn’t compete in both at the same time. So we pulled out of customer feedback, removed a couple of features, and repositioned Dovetail to focus on user research for teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By realizing we were spreading ourselves too thin, we simplified a lot for ourselves. The product is now clearly positioned to solve a specific set of related problems rather than two distinct problems. Our marketing messaging has been simplified; it no longer needs to communicate many things at once. And, most importantly, it has made it easier for us to make prioritization decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritizing with principles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritization is crucial for an early startup. Startups are resource-constrained yet highly ambitious. Making the right decisions about what to build next is a balancing act of tradeoffs, and we discovered it was important to have a few principles to help guide us in the right direction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Play to our strengths. &lt;/b&gt;Brad and I have certain strengths from previous experience which makes some things ‘cheap’ for our team. We try to prioritize things that play to these strengths. For example, we’d rather invest in making the product self-explanatory than rely on sales demos or comprehensive help docs. We prefer to create ‘fans’ who share Dovetail with their network instead of spending time and money on paid marketing where we have little knowledge. Figure out what’s ‘cheap’ based on your experience and what’s ‘expensive’, and prioritize the cheap stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create a great experience. &lt;/b&gt;Design is a huge differentiator for cloud products, and given that we didn’t have a lot of features early on, we knew we needed to make up the package for customers by delivering a great experience. This translated to a well-designed marketing website, a self-service onboarding experience, straightforward day-to-day product usage, responsive and friendly customer support, etc. Focusing on design plays to our strengths, separates us from the competition, and make the product more valuable (usability is very valuable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow the law of diminishing returns. &lt;/b&gt;A feature that’s 80% done is usually good enough. The last 20% has a diminishing return. We often release features that are 80% complete in order to get quick feedback and move on to the next one. Combined with our modern codebase and prior experience, this enables us to release a lot of features in a short amount of time. An important thing to note is that we never compromise on design or polish. We compromise on functionality. In other words, a given feature won’t do everything we want it to, but what it does do, it does well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, user expectations are very high for business-focused cloud products thanks to mature tools from companies like Google, Atlassian, Microsoft, Salesforce, and so on. When Dovetail was in its infancy, it didn’t have ‘basic’ features like search, import / export, integrations, and permissions. Right now it’s still missing core features that users naturally expect from their experience with other tools, like notifications, comments, and user management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had (and still have) a real challenge balancing these ‘table-stakes’ features with differentiating features that people actually buy Dovetail for. Users ask for table-stakes features since that’s what they expect from other tools, and indeed, some companies still make purchasing decisions based on a checklist of requirements. It felt very easy to simply end up with a piece of software jam-packed with features that actually did nothing valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following our principles above, and many more I haven’t covered here, we released a lot of features in 2018: bar chart, bulk editing, collaborative editing, CSV import / export, custom colors, domain-restricted signup, formatting toolbar, full-text search with querying, hyperlinks, images, and files, improved billing system, improved navigation, indented list items, inline audio / video previews, project access control, project categories, project templates, sentiment analysis, tables, trash, user onboarding, and a Zapier integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2018 was full-on and extremely tiring, but overall it was a great year for Dovetail. We’re thankful for all of our customers, friends, family, and everyone else who have helped us get this far. We couldn’t have done it without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, we’re focusing on becoming the obvious user research platform for businesses. This involves a lot of product development, hiring, and changes to become great at day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New access controls help you manage who can view and edit research projects]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/access-controls</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/access-controls</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’re typically fans of open access to user research data inside an organization because we believe that sharing user research insights and customer knowledge is the best way to build products people love. However we understand that some data is sensitive and our customers have valid reasons to restrict access to certain research data in their team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we’ve heard from users that colleagues they’ve invited to view their research sometimes accidentally make changes because it’s very easy to edit things in Dovetail. This has resulted in more than a few support cases asking to restore data that’s accidentally been deleted!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re always looking at how we can improve Dovetail to achieve our mission of being the best platform for teams to store, analyze, collaborate, and share user research data. So to address these two customer pain points, this week we released our new &lt;b&gt;project access controls&lt;/b&gt; to give users more control over who can view and edit projects. This feature is available now for customers on all plans except our Starter plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keeping things simple&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permissions in other products are often extremely complex and hard to understand. They involve roles, policies, schemes, and more. We try really hard to keep Dovetail simple and intuitive, even when adding powerful features like access controls. Access to a specific project can be controlled with only four access levels: &lt;b&gt;full access&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;view and edit&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;view only&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;no access&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clicking &lt;b&gt;Manage access…&lt;/b&gt; in the project actions (···) menu will open a new dialog where you can configure the access level for everyone in the team or specify access for individual users. Changes you make here take effect immediately in real time for all users, so there’s no need to refresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are two examples of how you can use team access in conjunction with individual user access to manage who can view and edit your project:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example 1&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the project view only for everyone in the team except certain people: set team access to &lt;b&gt;View only&lt;/b&gt; and grant &lt;b&gt;View and edit&lt;/b&gt; access to individual users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hide the project for everyone in the team except certain people: set team access to &lt;b&gt;No access&lt;/b&gt; and grant &lt;b&gt;View and edit&lt;/b&gt; access to individual users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default projects are &lt;b&gt;full access&lt;/b&gt; for everyone in the team. If a project is restricted beyond the default, you’ll see a padlock icon in the top right of the project. The padlock icon will be grey if you have &lt;b&gt;full access&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;view and edit.&lt;/b&gt; If you can’t edit anything, it’ll show up red instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more features to help you share and manage access to your data in Dovetail, like being able to share a &lt;b&gt;public link&lt;/b&gt; to a project, manage &lt;b&gt;users in groups&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;invite colleagues&lt;/b&gt; directly to a project.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A beginner’s guide to natural language sentiment analysis]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/sentiment-analysis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/sentiment-analysis</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis (sometimes called “opinion mining” or “emotion AI”) is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing&quot;&gt;Natural Language Processing (NLP)&lt;/a&gt; technique to categorize text depending on whether it expresses an opinion and whether the opinion is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced sentiment analysis can also categorize text by emotional state like angry, happy, or sad. It is often used in customer experience, user research, and qualitative data analysis on everything from user feedback and reviews to social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis can be combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning&quot;&gt;Machine Learning (ML)&lt;/a&gt; to further categorize text by topic. Together, sentiment analysis and machine learning provide researchers with a method to automate the analysis of lots of qualitative textual data in order to identify patterns and track trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sentiment analysis by example&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to quickly understand what sentiment analysis can do for you is by looking at examples. Take the following three sentences:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love flying Air New Zealand because they have the best food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That orange Fiat Multipla is the ugliest car I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this phone but wouldn’t recommend it to my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a human, you can read the first sentence and determine the person is offering a positive opinion about Air New Zealand. The second sentence is offering a negative opinion, and the last is also a negative opinion, although it’s a little harder to parse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You had to read each sentence manually and determine the sentiment, whereas &lt;b&gt;sentiment analysis&lt;/b&gt;, on the other hand, can scan and categorize these sentences for you as positive, negative, or neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like humans, sentiment analysis looks at sentence structure, adjectives, adverbs, magnitude, keywords, and more to determine the opinion expressed in the text. The advantage of sentiment analysis is that it’s much, much quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use cases for sentiment analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis has many practical use cases in customer experience, user research, qualitative data analysis, social sciences, and political research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing user feedback&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis is great for quickly analyzing user’s opinion on products and services, and keeping track of changes in opinion over time. For example, users of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; can connect to apps like Intercom and UserVoice; when user feedback arrives from these sources, Dovetail’s sentiment analysis automatically tags it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Categorizing reviews&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews are a perfect candidate for sentiment analysis since they’re written in the first person, and by their very nature, are offering an opinion. Reviews could be for hotels, airlines, rental cars, Amazon purchases, mobile apps, or anything else. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; is great for analyzing reviews; users simply upload a spreadsheet of reviews and Dovetail automatically tags sentences with ‘Positive’ and ‘Negative’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing social media posts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis is often used by researchers in combination with Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube’s API. A popular use case is trying to predict elections based on the sentiment of tweets leading up to election day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pros and cons of sentiment analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis works best with &lt;b&gt;large data sets written in the first person, where the nature of the data invites the author to offer a clear opinion&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great for &lt;b&gt;quickly analyzing &lt;/b&gt;thousands—or even millions—of pieces of data where topic categorization is less important than an overall indication of sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can give you &lt;b&gt;a starting point&lt;/b&gt; in qualitative data analysis by extracting strongly positive or negative sentences out of documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Works particularly well with data where the author &lt;b&gt;clearly expresses an opinion &lt;/b&gt;(e.g. app reviews, political views, user feedback).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat &lt;b&gt;context-agnostic &lt;/b&gt;– it doesn’t matter if the data is about politics, mobile phone reviews, cooking recipes, or anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some providers (e.g. Google and Amazon) have support for &lt;b&gt;multiple languages&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not a replacement for ML auto-categorization &lt;/b&gt;as it will only categorize text based on its sentiment, not the topic discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does not work well on &lt;b&gt;text written in the third person&lt;/b&gt;(e.g. user testing observations) or where the data is not someone’s opinion on a product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can struggle with &lt;b&gt;complex sentences &lt;/b&gt;involving double negatives, sarcasm, adverbials, unknown proper nouns and brand names, and greetings (e.g. “Best wishes!” or “Looking forward to your response” in email signatures).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How sentiment analysis works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in how it actually works? There are three main approaches to sentiment analysis. These are &lt;b&gt;knowledge-based&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;statistical methods&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;hybrid approaches&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge-based sentiment analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge-based techniques categorize text based on unambiguous ‘affect words’ like love, like, hate, happy, sad, angry, and so on. This is the simplest and oldest sentiment analysis technique, and also probably the least accurate. It works best on simple sentences like “I love cake” or “I dislike mushrooms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Statistical sentiment analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical methods use elements from machine learning where affect words are derived from a model trained on millions of other examples, along with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the computer detects the holder of a sentiment (the person with the opinion) and the target (the product or service) in a sentence. This approach can handle more complex sentences like “I don’t not like cheeseburgers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hybrid sentiment analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hybrid approach uses a combination of the above techniques, with the addition of an advanced understanding of language in order to detect semantics that are expressed in a subtle manner, e.g. building relationships between implicit and explicit concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other NLP techniques&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis is one of many NLP techniques. Other techniques that are helpful for user research and qualitative data analysis include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization&quot;&gt;Automatic summarization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation&quot;&gt;Machine translation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_entity_recognition&quot;&gt;Named entity recognition (NER)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition&quot;&gt;Optical character recognition (OCR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging&quot;&gt;Part-of-speech tagging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering&quot;&gt;Question answering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_boundary_disambiguation&quot;&gt;Sentence breaking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_segmentation&quot;&gt;Topic segmentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start using sentiment analysis today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can start using sentiment analysis in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open source tools. &lt;/b&gt;While free and flexible, these often require significant setup and may only run on certain operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Online APIs. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/&quot;&gt;Amazon Comprehend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; offer paid Natural Language APIs which are designed for large scale operation but require programming experience to configure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SaaS products&lt;/b&gt;. Companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; include sentiment analysis in easy-to-use features that require no data science or programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Announcing full-text global search with querying]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/full-text-search</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/full-text-search</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’m super excited to announce the release of full-text global search, available now in Dovetail. This is easily our most requested feature — just check out some of this customer feedback we’ve received over the past 6 months!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What no search? OMG it’s a thorn in my side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see search is high on your “coming up” list in the public roadmap — just curious if you can give any sense of when that might launch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to search the entire database of notes, insights, etc. based on tags and keywords?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve really been wishing for a global search feature (i.e., for all text files in a project). I used a text editor, years ago ~2002, UltraEdit for that very feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, you can now search all of your data within Dovetail and refine your search with our new query language, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/search&quot;&gt;Dovetail Query Language (DQL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DQL lets you filter results by project, type, tags, and more. Queries can be simple single words like slow or advanced queries with multiple fields like type:highlight project:feedback -tag:performance slow. As you type, Dovetail fetches results in real time to help you rapidly refine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, search is global, which means you can now create views of your data that span projects—something you could never do in Dovetail before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search can help you answer queries like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show me all the insights ever created across all projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show me all notes containing a specific word or phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show me highlights with both the tag ‘usability’ and ‘negative’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;…and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in and explore some of these use cases in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Search inside notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve indexed the content of all notes, tags, insights, and highlights which means you can now search for content &lt;b&gt;inside&lt;/b&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is super helpful if you’re hunting for a particular quote from a person and remember something they said, or if you’d like to quantify mentions of a specific word. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;confusing will return all notes containing the word ‘confusing’ or close variations like ‘confused’. If you’d like to see notes containing the word ‘confusing’ but only from the user feedback project, drill down further with a query like project:feedback confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Use exclusions to find outliers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DQL supports exclusion matching on fields, so you can insert a minus (-) in front of a field like -&lt;b&gt;type&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;-tag&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;-project&lt;/b&gt; to exclude results. For example, let’s say you wanted to find mentions of the word ‘slow’ that don’t currently have the tag ‘performance’:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;type:highlight slow -tag:performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Utilize multiple tags on highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With search you can now find highlights that have multiple tags. For example, if you’d like to see everything negative about usability, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;type:highlight tag:negative tag:usability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Increase specificity with match types&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DQL supports two match types for field variables. These are fuzzy match and exact match. Fuzzy match returns anything containing the word, whereas exact match returns anything matching the exact phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, project:feedback would return results from two projects called &lt;i&gt;Customer feedback&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Admin feedback&lt;/i&gt;, whereas project:“Customer feedback” would only return results from the &lt;i&gt;Customer feedback&lt;/i&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;See the context around highlights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search results for highlights show a snippet of text before and after the highlight in the note. This is called the &lt;b&gt;context&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context can be toggled globally by clicking &lt;b&gt;Actions (···)&lt;/b&gt; in the top right corner, or toggled on individual results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;See all highlights across projects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a combined view of tagged highlights across projects. If you have the tag ‘performance’ in more than one project, you can use search to see everything tagged with ‘performance’ across multiple projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;project:“Customer Feedback” project:“User Survey” tag:performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Visualize your data in a new way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects let you see your data as a list or a board, and now search gives you a third way to present your content: as a Pinterest-style masonry layout. This works particularly well with insights and looks great for screenshots!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start using search&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search is available now to all customers. Just refresh to get the latest code, and you’ll see a search button near the top left.

While researching search ourselves, we identified four tasks that Dovetail users felt were missing in the product that were each tangentially related to search:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Retrieval. &lt;/b&gt;Find the data I’m after (think Google or Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Navigation. &lt;/b&gt;Quickly get to what I want (think Spotlight or Alfred).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploration. &lt;/b&gt;Browse data that others have created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bulk edit. &lt;/b&gt;Perform bulk editing operations on a set of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal for search is to eventually satisfy all four of these tasks. Why? There are significant common foundations between each, namely that search is global across projects, and a flexible query language is required to customize the results and drill down to the specific set you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the following things planned for the future of search:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export search results to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More DQL fields like attachment, date, group, and sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Query autocomplete as you type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulk edit search results (copy, move, delete, add tag, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyboard shortcuts to enter / exit / select results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigation improvements for moving to results and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for images and files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saved searches with sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dovetail now supports images and files with drag and drop]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/supports-images-files</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/supports-images-files</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drag and drop images, audio, video, and other file types into notes, tags, and insights in Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We talk with a lot of researchers and product managers, and one of the frequent pain points we hear is that their raw research notes and files are stored in a different place to the analysis, insights, and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes live in Word or Evernote. Photos, recordings, and videos are in Dropbox or on someone’s computer. Analysis is on sticky notes, in spreadsheets, or in something like Reframer. The research is presented with Powerpoint / Keynote, and insights are stored for later reference on Confluence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s mission is to help teams build better products and services through customer feedback analysis and user research. While we’ve focused on textual data so far, we understand it isn’t just about text — research also includes rich assets like persona avatars, photos from workshops, screenshots of software, audio recordings of interviews, videos of user testing sessions, reports from other studies, presentations from different teams, and much, much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, you can now insert images, audio, video, and all other file types into your Dovetail notes, tag descriptions, and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Context is important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than create a simple ‘attachment’ feature, we thought it would be more powerful if you could insert images and files directly into the content of notes. This way, you can write around them to give them context, sync them in collaborative editing, reorder them on the page, tag them (coming soon) and copy / paste images and files between projects and notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of how you could use images and files contextually to supplement your research in Dovetail:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Store recordings with your analysis and transcripts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insert audio or video recordings of user testing sessions at the top of your transcript or notes from the session. Play them back while you’re analyzing the session to jog your memory or to get extra context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Collect inspiration and other relevant studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upload relevant presentations, documents, spreadsheets, and diagrams to your research plans and briefs, design specs, or research insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create personas with tags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Dovetail’s annotations and tags to create a set of personas based on evidence from your research. Add photos, tables, and formatting to the tag description and add detail to each persona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Add photos from your customer visits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drag and drop all of your photos and videos from customer visits, contextual inquiries, or interviews into your notes. Get them off your own phone and add them to your summary notes so others can see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep photos from your workshops&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add photos of your sticky note walls and sketches from workshops. Keep your workshop assets in the same place as your notes, action items, and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feature overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Files has a set of great features today with more planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;b&gt;*Works with all file types. &lt;/b&gt;Upload any type of file — photos, screenshots, audio, videos, spreadsheets, documents, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Device-specific image previews. &lt;/b&gt;Dovetail generates inline previews for images so they’re fast to load and save your bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instant preview.&lt;/b&gt; When you upload an image, we read it off your local disk so you can see it instantly, and upload in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background uploading.&lt;/b&gt; Continue to use Dovetail and even navigate to other projects while files are uploading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Native editor features baked in.&lt;/b&gt; Undo, redo, copy / paste, and syncing content during collaborative editing all works with images and files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multiple upload.&lt;/b&gt; Drop multiple files to upload them all in one go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support for @2x retina images.&lt;/b&gt; Upload images with an @2x suffix and we’ll display them at 50% size for retina screens. Happy designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secure timed access. &lt;/b&gt;Unlike many other cloud products, file URLs are dynamically generated with a 15 minute access window for extra security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encrypted data at rest.&lt;/b&gt; Like all of your data in Dovetail, we encrypt uploaded files in our database and backups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try it out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Files is available now. Just drag and drop files from your computer into the editor area of notes, insights, and tag descriptions. Please send us your feedback by clicking on the &lt;b&gt;Feedback &lt;/b&gt;button!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re nowhere near finished with our vision for images and files in Dovetail. There’s a lot we had to cut from this initial release and a few known issues that we’ll address soon. In the future expect to see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to highlight files with tags and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inline previews and streaming for audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cover photos and file type icons on cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bulk import experience for files including folder upload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;File names and properties included in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A project-level file management feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for animated Gif previews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved drag and drop reordering in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved image loading performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our list of qualitative research methods and techniques]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get swamped by the amount of information on qualitative research available online. Articles about qualitative research methods often use complex academic language and dance around the details of how to use these methods in your projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article lists a range of qualitative research methods. It briefly explains each method and includes rough guidelines on what you need to incorporate each one into your own qualitative research. Each method is linked to an article with more information if you’d like to learn more about a particular qualitative research method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Card Sorting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html&quot;&gt;Card sorting&lt;/a&gt; is a qualitative research method used to help determine the relative priority of features, categories, or pages. In a card sorting session, the participant is given small cards with a single word or short phrase on each one. They’re asked to rank the cards in priority order, or group them together and label the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a simple card sorting session might involve a list of features like “search”, “notifications”, “dashboard”, “activity feed”, “photos”, and so on. The participant might be asked to “rank each feature in priority order in terms of what matters most to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Card sorting is also used to help design or evaluate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture&quot;&gt;information architecture&lt;/a&gt; of a site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Recruiting, running the session, note-taking, recording, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; Index cards or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort&quot;&gt;OptimalSort&lt;/a&gt;, pen, and paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 5 – 20 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; Card sorting sessions usually take 15 – 60 minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 4+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; is an “up-close, in-depth, and detailed examination of a subject of study (the case), as well as its related contextual conditions.” Case studies are very broad and can take a variety of different forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In user research, a case study is often a report detailing how someone at a specific company uses the software. It includes information like their role, a description of a typical day, and demographic details along with information on the company. Case studies go into detail about the subject’s relationship with the software, what they like and dislike. Case studies often include quotes from the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Recruiting, interviewing, note-taking, recording, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; Audio recorder, camera, pen and paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 1 – 10 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; 2+ hours per participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 4+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Co-Design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design&quot;&gt;Co-design&lt;/a&gt; is an “approach to design attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end-users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-design sessions are similar to focus groups in that they involve multiple participants working together at once. However, they’re different in that they’re usually highly interactive and ‘hands-on’ rather than being a back-and-forth question and answer session. In user research, Co-design sessions often involve sketching and wireframing with both designers and end-users of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Recruiting, running the session, note-taking, recording, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; Audio recorder, camera, pen and paper, whiteboard, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 3 – 10 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; Sessions typically run for 1 – 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 8+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Competitor Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitor_analysis&quot;&gt;competitor analysis&lt;/a&gt; is simply an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the competition. User researchers use competitive analysis as a method to evaluate similar software products, and see how they ‘solved the problem’ or designed specific features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with an interface is an important factor in usability, so using employing design patterns and paradigms present in other related software is important. Competitor analysis is a good way to take note of the design patterns in other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Finding and evaluating competitors, note-taking, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Search&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; None.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; 1 – 3 hours per competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 2+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Contextual Inquiries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research often takes place in the researcher’s environment, for example, participants might visit your office for a usability test. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry&quot;&gt;contextual inquiry&lt;/a&gt; (and contextual interview) is a qualitative research method where the researcher observes or interviews a participant in the course of their normal activities in their own environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a contextual inquiry might involve visiting a customer’s office and seeing how their users interact with your software, or visiting a hospital or school, and observing doctors or students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Planning, recruiting, scheduling, note-taking, recording, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; Audio recorder, camera, pen and paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 1 – 10 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; 2 – 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 6+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus Groups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group&quot;&gt;Focus groups&lt;/a&gt; are like interviews, except rather than being one-on-one, focus groups are conducted with a group of demographically diverse people. Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus groups are often used in market research and political research, but they are heavily criticized in the user research community for their problems with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect&quot;&gt;observer bias&lt;/a&gt;, tendencies towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink&quot;&gt;groupthink&lt;/a&gt;, vocal participants dominating the discussion, and serving as a means to appease stakeholders. Apple’s Jony Ive said focus groups “ensure that you don’t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you still want to run a focus group, here’s what you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Recruiting, running the session, note-taking, recording, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; Audio recorder, video camera, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 5 – 15 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; Focus groups usually take 1 – 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 12+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grounded Theory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory&quot;&gt;Grounded theory&lt;/a&gt; is a “systematic methodology in the social sciences involving the construction of theory through methodic gathering and analysis of data.” Basically, grounded theory is a qualitative research method that starts from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grounded theory approach starts with a single question about a topic the researcher knows nothing about, for example, “what makes a couple re-marry after divorce?” The researcher then collects data, analyzes using ‘coding’, learns more, and repeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded theory is used heavily in social sciences and academia, but, due to its time-consuming nature, is not used often in commercial user research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Asking questions, collecting data, analyzing with codes, reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; All the tools!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; Varies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; Varies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; Varies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Persona Development&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html&quot;&gt;persona&lt;/a&gt; is a fictional character that is a realistic representation of someone in your audience. Personas have a name, an appearance, opinions, emotions, and demographic data like a location, job, income, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personas are used as a method in qualitative user research to help focus decisions by adding a layer of real-world consideration to the conversation. They also offer a quick and inexpensive way to test and prioritize features throughout development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personas are created based on real user research using the methods listed in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Researching, analyzing data, and creating personas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; Audio recorder, camera, pen and paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 5 – 20 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; Depends on the methods used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 12+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Structured Interview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common qualitative research methods, especially in a commercial setting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_interview&quot;&gt;structured interviews&lt;/a&gt; are interviews with a participant where the set of questions, the wording of questions, and the order of questions are consistent between each interview. Structured interviews are considered a means by which researchers can increase the reliability and credibility of their research data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured interviews are a straightforward way to collect high-quality research data without the time-consuming aspects of other qualitative research methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Planning, scheduling, taking notes, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 6 – 12 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; 30 – 90 minutes per interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 3+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Surveys&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(human_research)&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; is a list of questions aimed at extracting specific data from a particular group of people. Questions can result in quantitative data (e.g. single choice, multiple choice, likert scale) or qualitative data (open-ended questions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys are often used in market and user research to determine thoughts, feelings, and opinions from a sample of people. The design of your questions and the relevance of respondents greatly affect the quality of your data, however, creating effective surveys is an enormous topic that we won’t try to cover here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys are a frequently used qualitative research method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Creating a survey, finding people, analyzing responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://typeform.com/&quot;&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 20 – 1,000+ participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; Surveys typically take 5 – 30 minutes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 2+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unstructured Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_interview&quot;&gt;Unstructured interviews&lt;/a&gt; are similar to structured interviews, however, they follow a looser format. The set of questions, wording, and order may vary dramatically between each interview. Unstructured interviews are more like a free-flowing conversation, and as such, they’re more prone to go down rabbit holes. However, due to their relaxed nature, it might be easier to get truthful information out of a participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Planning, scheduling, taking notes, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 1 – 12 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; 15 – 60 minutes per interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 3+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usability Testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing&quot;&gt;Usability testing&lt;/a&gt; (also known as user testing) is used to measure the ease of use of a software user interface or a product. It’s a form of systematic observation focusing on measuring a human-made product’s capacity to meet its intended purpose. Examples of products that commonly benefit from usability testing are food, consumer products, web sites or web applications, computer interfaces, documents, and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants are given a task to achieve and are observed trying to complete the task. The testing session can range from rigorous (taking place in a ‘lab’ setting), to fast and dirty, which is sometimes called ‘hallway testing’ or ‘guerilla testing’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you’ll be doing:&lt;/b&gt; Planning, scheduling, testing, recording, taking notes, analyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested tools:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.io/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchapp.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Participants required:&lt;/b&gt; 5 – 20 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time required:&lt;/b&gt; 30 – 60 minutes per session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prep and analysis:&lt;/b&gt; 8+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tips for recruiting participants for user research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/recruiting-participants-user-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/recruiting-participants-user-research</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding, incentivizing, and managing research participants is one of the most logistically involved aspects of qualitative research, and is often underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participant recruitment for research involves a number of activities including sourcing eligible candidates, screening them, explaining the study, and keeping them motivated &amp;amp; incentivized throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s typical for recruitment to take longer than anticipated, project costs to balloon due to recruitment challenges, and researchers to overestimate the number of participants available. Even in studies that succeed in recruiting large numbers of patients, participation rates are low; only 3-20% of the eligible participant pool chooses to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that recruitment is a challenge, details about recruitment efforts and outcomes are rarely published, resulting in limited knowledge about why recruitment rates vary between studies and what the most successful approaches are for recruiting study participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we offer some tips to make your participant recruitment easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Establish who you’re looking for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your research method and what you want to learn from the study. This will help you determine the characteristics and number of people you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When recruiting for small sample studies, behavior, and attitudes are more important than demographics. For example, when conducting research for a furniture company’s online cart, it is better to find participants who are in the market for new furniture than it is to simply replicate the company’s current customer demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of raw numbers, usability tests can be run with a low number of participants—around 5 is adequate to surface key problems. When interviewing, aim to talk with roughly 10 people. Diary studies are typically conducted with 12 – 15 participants. These are all examples of ‘small sample’ studies. Surveys are on the other end of the spectrum, often requiring hundreds of responses to get meaningful, statistically significant results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start recruiting, here are some questions to ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I interested in specific behaviors or attitudes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I interested in specific demographics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I want to gather feedback for an existing product or service, or look for opportunities for a new one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many people do I need for my chosen method?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What am I prepared to spend per participant?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding them in the first place&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting the right participants is the foundation of effective user research because your research results are only as good as the participants involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representative, well-spoken, and thoughtful participants can provide invaluable insights, yet finding such ideal participants and getting them to commit is often the hard part. Here are a few ideas to start creating your ‘research recruitment funnel.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Start with your own users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re conducting research for your own product or service, reach out to people from your own customer database. However, watch for bias — they might be ‘fanboys’ and love your product, or they may loathe it. Obviously, recruiting existing customers doesn’t work if you’re trying to figure out why people &lt;b&gt;don’t&lt;/b&gt; use your product/service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recruit via your website&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in people’s motivations for trialing your product / service, or the problems they’re hoping to solve, recruiting them before they sign up could be beneficial. Use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethn.io/&quot;&gt;Ethn.io&lt;/a&gt; to show a form on your website that prompts visitors to sign up for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Post on social media&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a Google Form and share the link on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. To increase your response rate, mention your incentive in the message, and how much effort someone needs to spend. For example, “Please help me learn about student life on campus! $100 for only 30 minutes of your time.” You’ll get a wide variety of people responding, so the emphasis will be on your screener (see below) to weed out unsuitable candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ask friends or family&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach out to your friends or family, and ask your colleagues to do the same. Let them know your criteria, and optionally offer them a referral bonus if they find someone who ends up participating in your study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Engage a recruitment agency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of recruitment agencies who have &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-best-platforms-for-recruiting-user-research-participants/&quot;&gt;large pools of people available for research&lt;/a&gt;, although it doesn’t come cheap. In your screener, you will need to pay special attention to eliminate ‘professional research participants’ who know how to game the system to get the reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ask people on the street&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re conducting a quick usability test, try a bit of guerrilla research — ask people in cafes to look at your prototype in exchange for a coffee or 🍰 cake!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screening and setting expectations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few books or schools detail how to write an effective screener, and as a result, we often learn to write screeners through trial and error or reuse screeners from previous projects without considering whether they are still appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eliminate early&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t waste time by making participants go through a lengthy screener before getting to the questions that eliminate most people. Ask those questions first, so only the most likely candidates must go through all of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Identify conflicts of interest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate people who may have a conflict of interest or who have too much insider knowledge. For example, if you were conducting usability testing on an airline’s website with travelers, you should screen out people who work for that airline or a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Screen for computer knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the participants’ experience with technology matches that of your user groups. You’ll often want to eliminate people with too little or too much technical knowledge, unless their level of experience is appropriate for your project. In a usability test, you don’t want participants to confuse user interface problems with the problems new computer users face in general. Similarly, you won’t usually want to test with participants who are developers or designers as they bring a level of expertise and a focus that is not representative of a typical user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Screen out the silent ones&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research is all about making people talk (or write). There are few things worse than someone who gives only one-word answers, and it requires a lot of work to drag useful information out of such people. To determine how expressive people are, ask a few open-ended questions that relate to the topic of your study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ensure people have availability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure participants know what your expectations are for the study, and that they are available throughout the duration. If it’s only a 30-minute usability test, this shouldn’t be a problem, but if you are running a diary study over two weeks, make sure they know they need to stay committed throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eliminate professional user research participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who frequently supplement their income by participating in user research will say and do whatever it takes to get into a study. It’s often too easy for them to figure out the correct responses and avoid being eliminated. Ask open-ended questions about how often they participate in research, and include multiple elimination questions during the screener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keeping participants motivated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For longer research like diary studies, it can be tough to keep participants committed throughout the entire duration. A solid brief, constant probing, and trickled monetary incentives can help to keep people responding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the insights you need will take some involvement with participants throughout the study. Plan to check in with participants with periodic reminders as needed (each day or every few days). For participants that are engaged and creating appropriate snippets, recognize their efforts, and ask them to keep up the good work. For participants that are less engaged, give encouragement, or offer to answer any questions they may have to get them on track. Let participants know upfront that you will be reaching out throughout the study and agree on a means of contacting them, so you can give encouragement or ask for clarification without being overly intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diary studies require time and dedication from participants. To ensure you get the level of involvement you need from participants, provide an incentive that will keep them engaged. This compensation is typically much more than what you would offer for a 60-minute usability test. Align the incentive with the amount of work required over the period of the study. Consider breaking apart the total incentive and offering smaller installments as participants reach specific milestones (e.g., 3 days of logging), to keep them motivated throughout the duration of the study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Announcing automatic sentiment analysis at the sentence level]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/automatic-sentiment-analysis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/automatic-sentiment-analysis</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis&quot;&gt;Sentiment analysis&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is when software analyzes text and determines whether it expresses positive or negative sentiment. It’s often used on customer feedback like reviews and survey responses, tweets, and interview transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More granular; more accurate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Products that offer sentiment analysis usually analyze the sentiment of the whole document. Since this is a roll-up, it can be very inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dovetail, we analyze the sentiment of sentences, rather than a roll-up of the whole document. This allows for much more granularity, and highlights core pain points or compliments hidden in the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, an online flight review that covers several topics can be broken down and tagged appropriately:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were flying to/from LHR via YUL. These seats are located immediately behind a service bulkhead and afford a lot of legroom. The remote control is on wired tether which often tangled with other items and accidentally turned lights on or off or called cabin crew unnecessarily — annoying. The seats are leather-faced and comfortable. An amenities kit is provided with pillow and blanket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail will break this review into sentences and tag each appropriately. The bit about the remote control will be tagged &lt;b&gt;negative&lt;/b&gt;, while compliments about the leather-faced seats and amenities will be tagged &lt;b&gt;positive&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis becomes quite useful when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data like customer reviews and user feedback. Not only does it help you quickly gain an understanding of the opinions expressed across a bunch of data, but it also gives you a great starting point for further tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started in under two minutes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like everything in Dovetail, sentiment analysis is easy to use. In under two minutes, researchers and product managers can sign up, confirm their account, and analyze sentiment on their data. From there, it’s straightforward to use our tagging system to apply more granular tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick demo:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatic sentiment analysis is available now to all customers. It can be enabled when you import data using any of the following methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/import-structured-spreadsheet-data/&quot;&gt;Uploading a spreadsheet with data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/help/dovetail-zapier-app-reference/&quot;&gt;Importing data through a Zapier integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our new charts help you measure your tagging over time]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/charts-measure-tagging</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/charts-measure-tagging</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As you deliver new features and improvements you need to know whether they’re having the desired impact. You might be familiar with hypotheses or success metrics describing what &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; happen when a new feature is released, however actually understanding the impact and reception of a change once it’s out in the wild can be tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we ship this feature, we expect requests for this feature to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user feedback we receive will be more about tuning the MVP of what we’ve shipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect overall user satisfaction to increase once we ship this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you actually answer these questions? Often teams will look at engagement metrics to see whether their new feature is being used and how much it’s used relative to other existing features. But this only tells you part of the story. What do your users actually think about the new feature? Have you delivered something that delivers value, or is there still more work to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week we’re launching our brand new charts which helps designers, product managers, and researchers combine the power of Dovetail’s qualitative tagging with a quantitative visualization over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post we’ll give an overview of what you can do using our own &lt;i&gt;customer feedback&lt;/i&gt; project as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Roll up tags into groups for comparison&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dovetail, tags can be grouped together to help with organization. For instance, you might have a group containing all the tags relating to usability problems. Or you might group your tags by type of feature request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our case, we’ve put feedback containing new feature requests in one group and feedback about existing features in another. In our new chart, we can select these two groups and see how they compare:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see feedback on existing features has been decreasing, whereas feedback about new feature requests has been staying steady. This makes sense because we’ve been shipping more improvements to our core feature set recently, and resolving a few frustrating issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into the feature requests and find out what’s popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compare relative frequency of tags&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can open a group, for example feature requests, and see how each tag compares to one another. This gives us more information about what features people are after so we can anticipate trends and prioritize work accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we’re comparing the volume of feedback for a few different features we’re considering building. ‘Search / saved searches’ is by far the most popular and in fact that’s what we’re working on shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chart metrics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three chart metrics give you a slightly different perspective on the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annotations by tag. &lt;/b&gt;This shows the total count of annotations created on notes. For example, if you have 10 notes and across those notes you tag 14 annotations, this would show 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annotations by note. &lt;/b&gt;This is very similar to annotations by tag however it will only count an annotation at most once per note. Using the example above, this chart would show 10 annotations for performance. This is quite useful to adjust for ‘vocal minorities’ who might mention the same thing multiple times in a single piece of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tagged text volume. &lt;/b&gt;This shows the total character count per annotation. This chart is very useful to help you get an understanding of importance. Generally if people take more time to describe their problem or feature request, they think it’s quite important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data visualization options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the three chart metrics above, there are also several toggles to change how the data is presented. These can be found near the top right of the chart, above the legend / filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use color from tag / group. &lt;/b&gt;By default, chart colors come from a pre-determined array. This setting overrides that behavior and colors the lines according to the actual color of your tag or group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use smoothed interpolation. &lt;/b&gt;This setting switches between ‘jagged’ lines and ‘curvy’ lines. This one’s great for taking nice screenshots!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use square root Y axis. &lt;/b&gt;This setting switches between a linear axis and a square root axis. This improves readability with low volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charts are part of a foundation we’re building to help our customers work with higher volumes of user feedback.

The researcher starts with a  general topic they would like to learn about, for example, ‘young people’s eating habits in France.’ They will recruit participants from various backgrounds (in this case, young people in France). Diary studies usually have at least ten participants, but can be conducted at larger scales with over 100. Participants are typically incentivized with money or vouchers to take part in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study itself is sort of like a sandwich. The beginning has an introductory brief that explains the research topic and provides instructions to the participants. While the study is running (the ‘middle’ of the sandwich), participants receive questions or ‘prompts’ to help them stay on topic. At the end of the diary study, the researcher asks closing questions before analyzing the responses. Diary studies generally run from a few days to a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the differences between a diary study and a survey?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys collect self-reported information about a person’s habits and experiences outside of the context of the scenarios being studied. Diary studies are different in that they are more similar to ethnographic research — they’re very contextual and aim to get participants’ responses as they’re ‘living their life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys can often be laborious in length, and the questions can be designed to favor a particular outcome. The danger of surveys is that they are incredibly simple to create, but very difficult to get right. &lt;a href=&quot;https://muledesign.com/speaking/erika-hall&quot;&gt;Erika Hall&lt;/a&gt; writes about this in her fantastic article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/research-things/on-surveys-5a73dda5e9a0&quot;&gt;On Surveys&lt;/a&gt;. On top of this, surveys are filled out in retrospect, which can lead to recall bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, diary studies are instrumental when you’re interested in measuring changes over time. A survey only offers a snapshot, whereas a researcher can ask the same questions multiple times over the course of a few weeks and observe changes when the participants’ environment is modified. For example, a diary study about a mentoring program could follow a ‘mentee’ before and after they have received mentorship from someone and see how their life changes due to the mentor’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should you use a diary study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diary studies are useful for understanding long-term behaviors or changes in behavior, attitude, or feelings over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a contextual understanding of user behaviors and experiences over time, it can be tough to appropriately create scenarios in a lab setting to gather these insights. Diary studies are useful for more in-depth research, like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting rich customer feedback on products or services. &lt;/b&gt;What are the users’ primary tasks? What pain points are they experiencing during key flows? When completing a specific task, what workflow do they use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding new opportunities in the market&lt;/b&gt;. What solution are people using currently? Do they have problems we can solve in a better way? Is there an opportunity for a product or service?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mapping customer journeys.&lt;/b&gt; What is the typical customer journey and user experience as customers interact with your organization? What do they do when they onboard? What makes them stick around? Tell their friends?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Studying different cultures.&lt;/b&gt; What will we need to change about our brand / product / service to enter this market? How do people around the world perceive our brand? What sort of marketing resonates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding deeper emotions.&lt;/b&gt; What motivates people to perform specific tasks? How are users feeling and thinking? Where are the opportunities for delighting them? What makes them frustrated or angry? Why do they contact support?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building persona libraries.&lt;/b&gt; What are some common, holistic behaviors across groups of our users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do you run a diary study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/static/5aeb997f0b6c34b52f434236b3da88c1/cbe2c/pencils.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Diary studies are typically composed of five stages: designing the study, recruiting participants, collecting data, analyzing the responses, and sharing what you learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design the study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this stage, you define the focus of the study and what you want to learn. You may have a hypothesis here. Define a timeline, your ideal participants, and prepare instructions or support materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recruit participants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since diary studies require more involvement compared to other research methods, be extra prudent in the recruiting process. Let participants know what is involved and expected of them upfront. Ask screening questions that will help you gauge the level of commitment you will get from them during the study, and confirm their availability for the entire study period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start the study itself, take some time to brief participants. Ideally, schedule a face-to-face meeting or phone call with each participant and discuss the details of the study. Walkthrough the schedule for the reporting period, and explain what your expectations are for their answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collect data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different tools to collect your diary responses. Some researchers use a combination of survey software and IFTTT or email scheduling tools to send participant prompts. You can also get creative and try creating Tumblr blogs for each participant then have them write their entries there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyze responses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as data starts to arrive from participants, start analyzing! You’re essentially looking to identify high-level patterns across the full data set. See if you can find insights across multiple people, and compare those to demographic data. For example, you might find that people who live in the countryside are more likely to eat at home than those who live in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Share what you learned&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you will have people you want to share your insights with – teammates, other researchers, your manager, or friends. Often researchers will create a lengthy report or presentation to walk everyone through the design, method, and outcome of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In summary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While diary studies do require more time and effort than other research methods, they yield invaluable information about real-life behaviors and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for organic insights and you can’t create a valid scenario in the lab, or you can’t get the data you need from a single survey, don’t force-fit the research into these methodologies. Try a diary study instead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to attract visitors to your startup’s website]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/attract-visitors-startup-website</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/attract-visitors-startup-website</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a user researcher, it’s valuable to understand how people discover things in the first place. Marketing also plays a key role in shaping user expectations before someone signs up for a product or service. This guide introduces common marketing channels that help to drive traffic to your website, like social media, content marketing, SEO, paid advertising, referrals, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marketing channels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SEO&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Search Engine Optimization’ is the dark art of improving your ranking on popular search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Improving your content, website performance, mobile support, and ‘backlinks’ all contribute to improved SEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/4559176?hl=en&quot;&gt;Google Search Console&lt;/a&gt; straight away to measure your search ranking and improvements over time. There’s a lot of snake oil in the SEO industry, but a lot of the time it simply comes down to creating relevant, quality content. Google even have &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/40349?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3309300&quot;&gt;a section in their help documentation&lt;/a&gt; that says pretty much that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Provide high-quality content on your pages, especially your homepage. This is the single most important thing to do. If your pages contain useful information, their content will attract many visitors and entice webmasters to link to your site.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors to consider are site performance and mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend making quick-win performance improvements like loading JS asynchronously, minifying assets, and using sprites or inline SVGs for images. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/&quot;&gt;PageSpeed Insights&lt;/a&gt; is great for seeing what Google’s verdict is on your performance. It’s a checklist of things to do, so just make sure you do all of them (some may be harder than others) and it’ll help your search ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, both our website and product are responsive because quite frankly, there’s no excuse for websites not to have mobile support in 2017. At the very least your marketing website needs to be responsive, then you’ll either have a responsive product, a mobile site, or native apps for your app. A fast, mobile-friendly website will go a long way to improving your SEO and getting more traffic to your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Online advertising&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A form of marketing and advertising which uses the internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers, usually via Google AdWords, sponsored search results, and Facebook Ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I set up ad campaigns on both Google AdWords and Facebook Ads with identical budgets. Our hypothesis was that Google would out-perform Facebook in driving traffic to our website because people search for solutions to problems on Google, and we were building a solution to a problem! We’re very lucky that researchers (like developers, designers, and other ‘tech’ people) actively look to improve the way they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of detailed tutorials on how to create AdWords and Facebook ads, but before you dive in, here are the key terms you should understand first:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impressions.&lt;/b&gt; This is the number of people who have seen your ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click-through rate.&lt;/b&gt; This is the percentage of people who, after seeing your ad, click on it and visit your website. It’s usually quite low; around 1 to 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign up rate.&lt;/b&gt; This is the percentage of people who sign up on your website. It’s usually around 5%, and if it’s higher than this, you’re doing quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conversion rate.&lt;/b&gt; Assuming you have a free plan or trial period, this is the percentage of people who actually hand over some money, or ‘convert’ into a paying customer. This number varies wildly between companies and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acquisition cost.&lt;/b&gt; This is how much you spent to acquire a single paying customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Average lifetime value.&lt;/b&gt; This is how much money you expect to get, in total, from each customer. Your lifetime value should be greater than your acquisition cost otherwise you’re losing money when trying to acquire customers. (This may be okay if you’re building a social network or a ride-hailing service where the race to a critical mass of users is important. We’re not.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s map out a typical scenario using these five key metrics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AdWords and Facebook, you can pay per impression, click, or conversion. Let’s say you choose to pay per impression. You get 10,000 impressions on your search ad, and a 2% click-through rate, so 200 people have visited your website. Google or Facebook have charged you $300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with understanding why these companies are so wealthy, you now know that 200 people have visited your website from the ad. On your website, your sign up rate is 5%. So 10 of those people sign up for an account. Out of those 10 people, 2 of them decide to convert, making your conversion rate 20%. So you have spent $300 to acquire two paying customers. $150 per customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s say you charge them $50 per month. Each customer has to stick around for 3 months for you to break even. Any more than that and you’ll turn a profit, however of course this is not factoring in any company expenses. You then realize how great content marketing is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Content marketing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content marketing is free if you write the content yourself, lasts forever, and helps to boost your search ranking. Good content marketing can establish your brand as a reputable source of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intercom.com/&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hubspot.com/&quot;&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt; have demonstrated that content marketing can be an effective way to drive traffic to your website. In general, you’ll need to spend time writing highly-relevant, highly-focused articles targeted towards specific search queries to get visitors to your website. For example, our guide on the difference between qualitative and quantitative research is targeted at answering the search query “what is the difference between qualitative and quantitative research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first attempt involved writing a few blog posts about UX diary studies on Medium. Our Medium blog used to be on a subdomain (blog.getdovetail.io), and I read somewhere that it’s better for SEO to have posts on your main domain instead. I copied the research posts from Medium over to a new section on our website called Guides, and wrote a couple more. In fact, you’re reading one right now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Guest blogging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seek out blogs and Medium publications relevant to your audience and pitch articles for them. Brainstorm articles that provide value to their audience, trying to cover topics that are relevant yet come with a unique angle they wouldn’t have heard before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of great lists of quality blogs that accept guest articles – you could start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.izideo.com/blog/list-sites-accepts-guest-posting/&quot;&gt;this one of 1,500+ from izideo.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is organized by category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Q&amp;amp;A sites like Quora, StackExchange, and Reddit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting your website on Q&amp;amp;A sites like Quora and StackExchange can be a good source of high-quality website leads because people tend to be in ‘problem-solving’ mode when browsing these sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Dovetail’s quality website traffic comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://quora.com/&quot;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search for a problem that your website solves (e.g. “what tools exist for analyzing survey results”), find the Quora question, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Whats-an-automatic-efficient-way-to-analyze-answers-to-open-ended-survey-questions/answer/Benjamin-Humphrey&quot;&gt;post an answer&lt;/a&gt;. Link to your website and optionally include a disclaimer that you’re the owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quora questions place highly on Google search ranking, so a common acquisition path has been a customer searches for a problem, clicks on the Quora link, sees my answer, visits our site, and signs up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Aggregator sites and directories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregator sites like Product Hunt list lots of websites for a specific category or niche, e.g. startups, portfolio sites, design inspiration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From day one we noticed that people would sign up for Dovetail, take screenshots, and list us on aggregator sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nicelydone.club/&quot;&gt;nicelydone.club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sansfrancis.co/&quot;&gt;sansfrancis.co&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypershoot.com/&quot;&gt;hypershoot.com&lt;/a&gt;. We got a few sign-ups from these sites, but mostly these sites are valuable to build backlinks for SEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dovetail-2-3&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; in particular is supposed to be one of the premium aggregator sites for people to discover new startups. I had high expectations for Product Hunt came away somewhat disappointed. Their audience is mostly designers, developers, and startup founders who are looking for trendy software for inspiration. Most people on Product Hunt are unlikely to pay for B2B software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not building a chatbot, Slack add-on, or a design prototyping tool, then don’t bother with Product Hunt. B2B products in a specific market don’t do well there. Instead, find out where your audience hangs out and go there. In our case, that’s Quora, Twitter, Medium, and email newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Internal referrals through team invites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referral is the best kind of marketing channel. People are much more likely to try something if it’s been recommended by a friend or colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, another strategy we employ is in-product invitations. We needed to build ‘teams’ anyway in order to become a collaborative product. A nice side effect is user growth from researchers inviting the rest of their team. One person at a company might refer 5 or 6 of their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because our pricing model is not based on the number of collaborators you have (more on that in a later blog post), there is hardly any friction when inviting teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measuring success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will spend a lot of time experimenting with different marketing channels until you find reliable ones that deliver high-quality traffic at an acquisition cost less than their lifetime value. It’s important to note that marketing channels differ between industries and products. Beauty and clothing startups might have a lot of success on Instagram, but your highly technical data warehouse solution probably doesn’t lend itself to hipster, filtered photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you experiment, you need to measure. Measuring different marketing strategies is the only way to find channels that work for you. We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixpanel.com/&quot;&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/a&gt; primarily for in-product behavioral analytics, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; for page view and demographic data. It’s also a great idea to also install a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755&quot;&gt;Facebook Pixel&lt;/a&gt; on your site even if you’re not planning on marketing via Facebook yet. It can start building a custom audience of website visitors which is great for remarketing later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Mixpanel specifically, you will most likely need to do some work to connect the JavaScript library with your backend so you can link anonymous users browsing the website to the actual user ID in the database when they sign up. This means you can track someone’s journey from the website all the way into your product. Mixpanel then has some neat features that help you figure out the ‘aha!’ moments that cause people to convert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave analytics instrumentation too late. Add it as part of your regular development so you can start collecting data and learning from it straight away. With Google Analytics connected to AdWords, you can see what ads are generating paying customers. Likewise with Facebook. Optimize for conversion rather than clicks or impressions since that’s closer to revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Use our Zapier integration to import data from over 750 apps]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/zapier-integration</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/zapier-integration</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conducting research and gathering user feedback is vital for building your product roadmap, but organizing and analyzing that information can be time-consuming without the right tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail helps you collect and organize your research data and user feedback so you identify valuable insights.

Intel focused on shrinking and improving an existing chip microarchitecture in the ‘tick’, and in the ‘tock’ they develop an entirely new one. This approach had been very successful in helping Intel innovate on new architectures while setting aside dedicated time for improvement and response to user demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/intel-tick-tock-model-general.html&quot;&gt;In their own words:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this model, Intel commits to — and has successfully delivered — continued innovations in manufacturing process technology and processor microarchitecture in alternating “tick” and “tock” cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software companies have a tendency to go from new feature to new feature, rarely revisiting old ones. It’s understandable why — building new features is sexy. SaaS is a competitive landscape where products are often evaluated with a feature checklist. New features provide constant fuel for the marketing fire, and show momentum to customers and investors. An entirely new thing is easier to sell than improvements to existing things. Yet shipping feature after feature with no break inevitably leads to complex products, low code quality, design debt, and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key problem is that a design polish or engineering health phase is rarely baked into the roadmap. Features ship in their MVP state and stay there for life. Designers are frustrated about all the small details and usability improvements that were cut from the MVP, and problems that were discovered after the initial feature launch are rarely prioritized above the next big feature. Developers complain about never getting a chance to refactor code or work on process improvements (like reducing build times), which eventually piles up and causes developer happiness to plummet. Counter-intuitively, going so fast actually ends up making you go slow, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hut8labs.com/speeding-up-your-eng-org-part-i.html&quot;&gt;speed is everything&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to a competitive advantage in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to step back from feature development to take stock, look at the product holistically, iterate on what you shipped based on user feedback, spend time on engineering health, and polish the design. This finessing is what separates good products from great ones. At Dovetail, we want to build a &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; product, not just a good one. So inspired by Intel, we’ve applied the tick-tock model with a few changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time scale is completely different. Intel alternates cycles every 12–18 months. For us, it’s every couple of weeks, but there’s no fixed schedule. Rather than interrupting feature development to start a tick cycle, we’ll alternate when we feel the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our tick, we spend time on small improvements across the board: design, code health, performance, developer happiness. In our tock we build big new features like concurrent editing and our Zapier integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel’s objectives are much clearer than ours. We’re still experimenting with our product, so we’ll often ship a feature, see how it’s received, then come back to it. We do this more with core experiences like the navigation within a project and back-and-forth between the list and a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agile is about iteration and constant improvement. But a lot of the time people interpret agile as “we’re going to ship this feature, then this feature, then this feature, look how fast &amp;amp; agile we are!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying truly agile (quickly responding to feedback, iterating, and constantly improving) is not something you get for free. The tick-tock model represents an explicit investment in agility while balancing new feature development. The tick cycle gives us a chance to set the product (and code) up for long term success, keeps us fast, and gives us a chance to respond to feedback before moving on to the next big feature in the next tock.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lessons from the trenches of pricing]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/pricing-lessons</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/pricing-lessons</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered finding your idea, and driving initial traffic to your website.

We haven’t raised money—we’re ‘bootstrapping’—so our goal is to make a profit as soon as possible in order to become a sustainable business. Otherwise, we won’t be a business at all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s your business model?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step to figuring out how you will make money is to deeply understand your business model. This seems obvious, but it’s often overlooked by some founders who gravitate towards ‘building cool shit’ more than ‘shit that has a sustainable way to generate revenue.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building cool shit is certainly a fun part of creating a startup, but if you want to turn a profit, you’ll need to think about what problem you’re solving, your market size, what differentiates you from the competition, how willing your target audience is to spend money, your sales strategy, and how you will use customer data. The easiest way to learn what could work is by speaking to potential customers or your existing users (if you have some).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided early on I’d like to create an ethical company that protects customer data and doesn’t splatter advertisements everywhere. Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, our goal would be to build a fantastic product that people are happy to pay for because they get true value. At the time I didn’t know exactly what shape that product would take, and we’re still learning. That’s not a bad thing. You won’t get it right on the first try. What is important is understanding the &lt;b&gt;problem&lt;/b&gt; you’re solving, and specifically &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; you’re solving that problem for. &lt;i&gt;How&lt;/i&gt; you solve it will evolve as you learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have four customer personas: design researchers, academic researchers, government services researchers, and research agencies. That’s a lot of terms with the word research! Given these four groups of customers, the worldwide market size is large enough for us to pursue a high volume, low-cost B2B model. With a modern, collaborative cloud product and the disruptive speed of a startup, we believe we can disrupt antiquated competitors, help automate manual research tasks, and generally make researchers feel like superheroes within their team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One large segment of our target audience — design researchers — work in R&amp;amp;D departments around the world. A lot of great tools exist for the ‘D’ but not so much the ‘R’. These researchers have a significant budget for tools that improve their process and save time; ultimately so they can get more done and share insights more effectively. And, as I touched on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/attract-visitors-startup-website/&quot;&gt;in my last article&lt;/a&gt;, researchers search for solutions to problems, exist in tight communities, and are tech-savvy, so finding them shouldn’t be too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the core of our business model. Depending on your market size and audience, you might need a high touch sales team to win over customers if they don’t look for solutions, or if your software costs more than what someone is willing to slap on their credit card and expense. Will you charge a subscription fee, or a once off-cost? Perhaps customers don’t pay with money at all, and instead, pay with their anonymized data like so many consumer social products today. What dimensions will you charge on? You could restrict access to features, the amount of users, or the usage of the product. Each have their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get answers to these questions, you’ll need to do some research!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learn from the competition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of competitor analysis, you should specifically investigate the pricing model of your competition. Here are a few things to take note of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is their pricing transparent, or do you need to talk to sales?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How complex is their pricing? e.g. do they have a single price point, or do they have multiple offerings available?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What dimensions do they charge on? e.g. per user, usage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s their price point? Will you be undercutting them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How frequently do they charge customers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your potential customers will be evaluating lots of different tools to solve their problems. If there’s somewhat of a ‘standard’ way pricing is done in your industry, that will form part of their mental model. It might be advantageous for you to stick to the standard so it’s easy for your customers to compare, or you could use this as an opportunity to differentiate. For example, a lot of research software is sold via annual licenses. By charging per month, we give researchers more flexibility, which is a positive for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t directly ask users whether they would pay for your product. People aim to please whoever they’re talking with, so they will inflate their likelihood of paying if you ask outright. Instead of asking directly, you could slip a pricing question into a survey worded along the lines of “at what point would x start to look expensive? Have a range of prices as answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS), retention, and simply raw usage give a good indication if people are getting value out of what you’ve built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The first impression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will people kick the tires? Most SaaS products offer a free plan limited in some way, or time-limited trial. Other products don’t offer any way to evaluate the product without talking to a salesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you do depends on your audience and their use case. We started with a usage-restricted free plan because diary studies take a while to plan, so a 7 or 30-day trial didn’t make sense. By the time the researcher gets their ducks in a row, the trial will be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our product is evolving beyond diary studies into features that encourage recurring use, collaboration, and data storage. We recently changed to a single price point and a 30-day trial to reflect this. An unlimited trial allows researchers to experience the full capabilities of the product, rather than being limited in some way. We also scrapped our four plans and switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/pricing&quot;&gt;a single price point of $99.00 USD / month for unlimited everything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of a trial period and a single price point simplifies things for our customers. They don’t have to worry about moving between tiers when they want to invite more users or use the product more. It also simplifies things for us. We don’t have to build restrictions on new features which allows us to move faster. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In saying all of that, of course, our pricing will change again in the future, which brings me to my last point:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research, try, fail, learn, repeat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment with your pricing. Startups have many advantages over larger established companies, and one of them is that you can change things and experiment quickly. This goes for pricing just like anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Taking the plunge on your startup]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/startup-plunge</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/startup-plunge</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It had been two months since our October launch and Dovetail had 200 users, of which 20% were active each week running real studies. This felt like good traction at the time but I still had 99 problems. I needed to restart the app every 6 hours due to a memory leak and the scheduling system was unreliable during restarts since it wasn’t idempotent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MVP was built by an external agency, so I hired them once again before a holiday to the US. I couldn’t get the original developers and ended up with another developer who quit the agency one week into my project (unrelated to me!). The whole project dragged on as the client manager tried to find someone else to complete the work. Meanwhile, I was debugging a memory leak in code I could hardly read without the people who wrote it around to help. I spent parts of my holiday debugging and I eventually figured it out. The leak had a simple fix after a lot of investigation: the library that inlined CSS for emails was caching the entire application’s CSS. The fix was splitting the email CSS into a separate stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got back to Sydney and decided this would be the last time I outsourced development. Outsourcing might work to build a simple MVP to validate your idea and the market demand, but to move forward I needed someone who could architect the code, do the bulk of the development, and stick around to help when things got hairy. I needed a technical co-founder, and I made that my main goal heading into the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point, I had been pestering Brad for several months. Thankfully my refined pitch, the traction Dovetail had from launch, and the positive customer reception was enough to convince him to join as a co-founder. We had a lot of discussions about how we would work together. If I were to summarise the ‘ideal co-founder relationship’ in bullet points, I’d say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complimentary skills. &lt;/b&gt;Development is just one aspect of a startup. Someone has to design the product, run marketing, customer support, keep track of expenses, apply for grants, talk with investors, do customer research, etc. Complimentary skills enable Brad and I to run fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High trust and respect. &lt;/b&gt;One of us will be the ‘expert’ and the other person just has to trust the expert. I need to trust Brad with technical decisions, likewise, he has to trust me with design decisions. Of course, we have sparring and discuss things in detail, but because we move quickly we don’t spend too long on trivial decisions. The relevant person makes the call and we move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Similar experience levels. &lt;/b&gt;One person feeling like they are the ‘noob’ all the time isn’t healthy. Brad and I are the same age and we’ve been in the workforce for a similar amount of time. We’ve both got 8 years of Atlassian experience between us on a variety of teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compatible personalities. &lt;/b&gt;You will be spending an insane amount of time with each other, so you must get along. At the moment I spend more time with Brad than I do with Lucy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Going full time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad and I were still working full time and coding Dovetail in the evenings and on weekends. As I talked with more customers, I became more confident and excited about the opportunity for better software in the research space, but it was clear we needed to give Dovetail our fullest attention to have a chance at success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four years of putting in 110%, I was burned out from Atlassian. At the end of (Australian) summer, I took two months off work. I needed a break, but I also wanted to see whether I would go crazy working at home. I didn’t. In fact, it was pretty awesome. At the end of this mini-sabbatical it was clear my passion had shifted to Dovetail and the decision to leave Atlassian was tough. I was certain I wanted to try and ‘bootstrap’ instead of taking investment, so obviously a lot of considerations were financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did a lot of due diligence before making the final decision to leave our paying jobs. We see Dovetail as a financial investment but also an investment in ourselves. We’re both ready for different challenges and we’re in a stage of our lives where we can take risks. Brad and I looked at our expenses, talked about ‘salary’ expectations, and ran some exercises to check we were on the same page. In one exercise we each described Dovetail in three years and compared. For me, it was critical we both had the same expectations — the last thing you want is one founder imagining a ‘lifestyle business’ and the other dreaming of a billion-dollar IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful startup is the result of making informed decisions, not counting on luck. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/pricing-lessons/&quot;&gt;We had just launched pricing&lt;/a&gt;, so I forecasted how many customers we would need to break even. This information plus our growth rate gave me the numbers I needed to model our runway based on an initial investment Brad and I put in. I had worked on Dovetail myself for a few months before Brad joined, so I looked at how much time I had invested and multiplied that by the market rate for a senior designer in Sydney. Brad would invest the same ‘seed’ as me plus extra to make up for that time spent. We each own 50% of Dovetail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing we’ve learned is that researchers do not run diary studies very frequently. Customers sign up for a paid plan for the duration of their study, then cancel once it finishes. Brad and I decided to go back to the drawing board and start working on features that encouraged repeat use. We needed to expand &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/outsourcing-startups-mvp/&quot;&gt;beyond the diary studies MVP I created with the outsourcing agency&lt;/a&gt;, and into a product that solves more common researcher problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reality check&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dislike the word pivot. It often has negative connotations (&lt;i&gt;“oh, you didn’t get it right the first time around?”&lt;/i&gt;), and the reality is that startups are always pivoting anyway. You never get it right the first time. One huge benefit of a startup is that you are extremely agile and can pivot all the time if you haven’t found product-market fit. Also, its definition is unclear—you can ‘pivot’ the core feature set or marketing message dozens of times while continuing to target the same problem space. Is that a pivot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In saying all of this, I had gone down the diary studies rabbit hole and lost sight of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/startup-idea-discovering-validating/&quot;&gt;our mission&lt;/a&gt;. Brad, with somewhat of a fresh perspective, convinced me we needed to evolve into something that researchers could use more than a few times a year. Ideally every day. We scheduled a bunch of customer interviews to help us figure out what that looks like, and for the past few weeks, I’ve been sharing sketches and designs with our customers to see what they think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible we could double down on diary studies and eventually become profitable. I don’t think we would be &lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; profitable, and that journey would be tough. So we’re pivoting the feature set while still going after the same general problem space of qualitative research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Moving to a new stack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this new work, we’re taking the opportunity to incrementally rewrite the original outsourced code. Ruby on Rails was great at getting us where we are, but the new features we’re building demand a more modern stack, particularly on the frontend. Real-time collaboration and a single page app with no page refreshes are two features people take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temptation to rewrite everything is strong but stupid. We’d spend our whole runway rewriting code and not moving forward. We won’t move off Rails completely any time soon. Instead, we’re slowly replacing components and services with React, Node, and GraphQL. It’s exciting, I’m personally learning a lot, and our frontend is much happier with the modularity and reusability that React brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re working to get a usable alpha of our new stuff out the door as quickly as possible, while making technical decisions that help us speed up development and build experiences people will love. We hope to launch our new version of Dovetail over the next couple of months. Stay tuned because I think you’re going to love it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Outsourcing your startup’s MVP]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/outsourcing-startups-mvp</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/outsourcing-startups-mvp</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compromising is part of product design, and often the compromise is cutting scope. Cutting scope is better than compromising on quality. (Quality being defined as design, usability, stability, and performance.) Customers get excited about a product that does a few things well, whereas they’re turned off by poor execution, because poor execution erodes their trust in your brand and their confidence for the future. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is about cutting scope from your grand plan while maintaining quality. It’s the smallest thing you could build to test the viability of your idea in a real-life scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re a solo founder, you’re very interested in cutting scope because not only do you have to design the product, you also have to build it. I realized &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/startup-idea-discovering-validating/&quot;&gt;my long term vision for Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; as a ‘qualitative research platform’ would need to hit the back-burner as I decided to focus on diary studies first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking this niche for our MVP was a good decision, although only just. There isn’t much competition for a diary study product, automating a manual process has clear value, and because it’s a niche, marketing and SEO are straightforward. Yet one thing I overlooked is how infrequently researchers run diary studies and how important recurring revenue is for a business. More on that in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d written some JavaScript in the past, so I thought Node.js, Firebase, and Twilio SMS (for the contextual diary entries) would be a decent stack. A few days of spiking made me realize this was harder than I thought, so my girlfriend suggested Ruby on Rails since she’s familiar with it. The thought of learning another language when I hardly knew JavaScript frightened me. But one of the nice things about Ruby on Rails is that — unlike Node — it’s very opinionated. Ruby on Rails makes it clear when you’re going down the wrong path because the light starts to fade away, the trees contort into creepy shapes, and howling noises emerge from the dense forest that appears to have engulfed you. You quickly find another path (usually on StackOverflow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The outsourcing option&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around this time somebody suggested outsourcing via &lt;a href=&quot;https://upwork.com/&quot;&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt;. I had never considered outsourcing, and I investigated Upwork and decided to give it a shot. After all, what else could I do? I believed in the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a designer, so I sketched, wireframed, and designed until I had a clickable InVision prototype. If you’re not a designer, try to sketch your idea anyway, and look for a freelancer to help you with the high fidelity designs and prototype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of quotes appeared within minutes of posting the job on Upwork. Mostly automated, mostly rubbish. I reduced the offers down to two: a solo developer in the US and a web development agency in Poland. The solo developer had startup experience, although he wanted to use Node and his timezone overlap with Sydney wasn’t great. (I was still working at Atlassian, so could only start work on Dovetail at 6 pm.) The agency had a comprehensive quote and understood the idea. They were an established business specializing in Ruby on Rails development. Most importantly, their timezone meant I could work with them in the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went over the details of the project and I walked them through the design prototype. I told them my budget, they came back with a quote of around $5,000 USD and a four-week estimate. We broke the project down into milestones and had partial payments released at each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pro tips for outsourcing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned a great deal working with the development agency throughout those four weeks. If you’re thinking about outsourcing, here are some tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be prepared.&lt;/b&gt; This is not the time to be Agile. Plan everything in advance. Have designs, requirement documents, tasks, and a clickable prototype if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be present.&lt;/b&gt; Ask for regular check-ins, screenshots, and demos. Upwork has a built-in chat tool, so use that to talk with the team. If you can code a little, get the code and review it. At the least, you’ll start to familiarise yourself with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be prescriptive.&lt;/b&gt; When working at Atlassian, I could ask developers to use their common sense with small design decisions. Contracted developers are eager to avoid mistakes and loathe ambiguity. They make no guesses about the behavior of functionality. You will need to tell them exactly how you want everything to work and provide all assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set expectations.&lt;/b&gt; Triple check the developers know what the final deliverable should be and what your expectations are for quality. Again, a clickable prototype is a great way to &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; what you want instead of telling, and it helps bust through language barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider a team over a single developer.&lt;/b&gt; Agencies give you more security than a solo developer. They often have a project manager who can speak fluent English, and the developers have others around them to ask for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider the time difference.&lt;/b&gt; Ensure their working hours line up with yours, otherwise you might find yourself on a Skype call in the middle of the night. If you’re working a day job like I was, then shoot for overlap in the morning or evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use a site like Upwork.&lt;/b&gt; They hold the money in escrow until both parties agree the work is completed satisfactorily. They also have a review system that is useful for vetting, and can help mediate disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the four weeks, I reviewed what I got. The Ruby backend and configuration on Heroku looked reasonable, but the frontend was a mess. I spent long nights rewriting JavaScript, the view templates, and CSS. The developers opted to use Bootstrap, which would normally be fine, but as a designer, I am quite picky with details. If you’ve ever worked with Bootstrap, I’m sure you understand how difficult it can be to customize. The CSS codebase was 50% overrides. Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned a great deal about working with tests, continuous integration, deploying to Heroku, and Ruby on Rails’ Model View Controller framework. I was already on the path to ‘becoming a developer’ although I hardly noticed because I was focused on the output. There were frustrating moments where I wanted to give up, and at least once or twice I felt utterly useless and out of my depth. My morale was a rollercoaster during this time. Huge shoutout to my girlfriend Lucy who helped me through these programming hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from Bootstrap, I was happy with the result I got from the development agency. The project had gone smoothly, within budget, and within time. But most importantly, I now had a working thing! The next step was the daunting task of getting some people to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thoughts on discovering a startup idea and validating it]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/blog/startup-idea-discovering-validating</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/blog/startup-idea-discovering-validating</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you are building a startup then you have an idea. Ideas are usually formed by observing a problem, whether it’s one that you have, or a problem someone else has. It takes a lot of introspection to recognize your own day-to-day problems, but as a designer by trade, I’m good at recognizing the problems other people have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I was working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; growth team. At the time we were interested in improving the experience people had when signing up for our products. Purchasing decisions are rarely made in an instant; instead they’re made over a few days. We wanted to understand what the ‘aha!’ moments were that caused people to fork out their credit cards and convert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth team had a fair amount of quantitative data at our disposal. The data told us people spent a short amount of time in the products on their day one, and half didn’t bother to come back on the second. Depressing as this data was, it turned out to be quite useful when justifying the purpose of our team in the wider organization. Now the marketing voice in your head might wonder whether this behavior could be attributed to low-quality leads. At the time Atlassian’s sign up flow was quite convoluted; evaluators had to pass through a maze to get to the cheese, which had the effect of weeding out low-quality leads. We were left with somewhat committed individuals. So why weren’t they sticking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative data is quite good at telling you what people do, but not why they do it. Why somebody does something is a complicated question that requires you to probe into people’s lives and understand their environment, expectations, mental model, and constraints. To learn more about the why, our researcher suggested a longitudinal study over those first few days. A diary study. As the name suggests, participants fill in a ‘diary’ entry every day, answering specific questions the researcher is interested in. We designed a nice two-week-long study, recruited participants, and got to work. And this is where I observed the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diary studies come with a few challenges out of the box:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They take place over many days, so it can be hard to keep participants motivated throughout the entire period. One way to combat this is with daily ‘prompts’ that remind participants to fill out their entries and stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most diary studies, the researcher asks the participant to answer questions each evening. Participants often forget what they did during the day when asked to recollect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diary studies usually have around 12 participants and they might run for one or two weeks. If each participant fills out an entry every day, you end up with a lot of data to analyze for a sole researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ended up creating a private Tumblr blog for each participant and emailed them credentials to write their entries as blog posts. Our researcher also manually prompted every participant to fill in their journal each day. When the study was over, she copied the entries out of Tumblr and into Word, before transferring key quotes and themes to post-it notes. The post-it note wall was about 3 metres long, so she then had the challenge of turning this into something that was shareable with the rest of the team. The end result was a report on Confluence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did get some useful insights but the whole exercise took about two months. I was sold on the value of diary studies, but not the cost. I thought about how it could be improved, and came up with a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logistics — like setting up a way to collect diary entries and emailing reminder prompts — could be automated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than asking participants to fill out one big entry at the end of the day, I thought breaking questions into smaller chunks and spreading them out might result in more contextual responses and less recollection bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While post-its are flexible, digitising data makes it searchable, preserves references when merging &amp;amp; splitting, and helps analysis scale. Also, if the data were online in a decent format, it would be easier to share with the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I talked with other designers and researchers I knew and learned more about the process of analysing qualitative data. Most existing analysis software comprises native Windows or Mac apps built for individual users, and licensed as such. I saw a further opportunity to make the analysis process more collaborative through cloud-based software, because, like designers, researchers are always keen on getting everyone involved in their process to help build customer empathy within a cross-functional team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have an idea, the next natural thing is to see if anyone has done it already. I hear people shrug off ideas that “have been done before” as if a) there’s only room in the market for one product, or b) you believe you can’t do a better job of executing than the other guy. I should note here that this doesn’t mean you should go out and build a Facebook competitor. Or, if you do want to do that, perhaps read up on the first-mover advantage and monopolies first. In general though, there will always be competition, and often that’s a good thing. Competition proves there’s a market for your idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started on some competitive analysis. With competitive analysis, you’re researching other products that aim to do the same ‘job’ that your product does. (If you’re interested in this, or simply enjoy milkshakes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuSM3yUxik&quot;&gt;check out Clayton Christensen’s talk&lt;/a&gt;.) Based on this definition, Dovetail’s competitors is everything from post-it notes, to Excel, to fully-fledged Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software. What a mouthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each competitor I covered the following in a Google Document:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product offerings and functionality.&lt;/b&gt; What problem does their product solve? What are the key features? Is it cloud-based, native on desktop, or a mobile app? Is it part of a suite?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pricing model and price point.&lt;/b&gt; Is their pricing available on the website? Do they charge a subscription or a once-off payment? Do they charge for usage, number of users, extra features, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product ease of use.&lt;/b&gt; Does the product have a small number of key concepts? Is the information architecture easy to understand? Have they managed the flexibility–usability tradeoff well? Is their visual design modern, or outdated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purchasing experience.&lt;/b&gt; Can I sign up myself or do I have to go through a salesperson?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marketing terminology.&lt;/b&gt; How do they talk about themselves? Do they use the same terminology as we do? How do they describe their customer’s problems? What customers do they have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Velocity and agility.&lt;/b&gt; How often do they release updates? Do they appear to be agile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Company attributes.&lt;/b&gt; How many employees are there? What’s the size of R&amp;amp;D compared to the rest of the company? Are they public or private? How long have they been around? Do they have funding?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the products I evaluated had hidden pricing and no way to sign up yourself. I faced ‘request a demo’ or ‘contact sales’ buttons. For some of these I did actually request a demo and ended up talking with salespeople for the next few weeks. Demo videos on YouTube and official online documentation are great ways to get an idea of a product if you can’t access it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks of competitive analysis, I found that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t a lot of startups in this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing qualitative research tools are expensive, have opaque or antiquated pricing models, are poorly designed, hard to use, and non-cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the ‘competition’ turned out to be design research consulting agencies who didn’t actually have a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had my problem, some ideas on how to solve it, and an understanding of the competitive landscape. But while I dabble in code, I am not a developer, so I needed to find someone who was. Luckily I knew a bunch of developers and started pitching my idea to them. Pitching to people (not just developers) is a great way to massage the idea itself, and over time it evolved beyond simply ‘diary studies’ into more broadly ‘a platform to help researchers collect, analyse, and share qualitative data.’ While we’re on the subject of pitching ideas, please do not ask people to sign an NDA before you pitch to them. There’s no need. Ideas without execution are worthless. The person you’re pitching to is doing you a huge favour by listening and offering feedback on your idea. Don’t make them jump through unnecessary hoops to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at some point my pitch went like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a web app that lets you run diary studies. You configure scheduled questions which are sent via SMS to participants, and they can reply with their answer and a photograph. It helps to automate the process of running a diary study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It evolved into this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of hoorah on the internet about ‘big data’ and ‘growth hacking’ but not a lot of excitement around qualitative research. It’s often expensive, slow, and filled with uncertainty, which gives it a bad rep. ‘Analytics’ is instant, and there’s a naïve belief that the numbers have all the answers, and with certainty! However interpreting data correctly is very difficult, and so is instrumenting it in the first place. Many companies are beginning to realise that ‘growth hacking’ is not a silver bullet that fixes products or services. To do that properly you have to talk to real people and get a deeper understanding. I realised the value of qualitative research is immense when done correctly, and there is a huge opportunity to empower researchers through better tools. In the next few years there will be a resurgence of qualitative methods, and if someone can figure out how to make it less expensive and faster, then everybody wins. The richness of qualitative data, the speed of quantitative, and the cost of well, not much at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you spot the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a few nibbles. Some friends were interested but they weren’t ready to leave their paying job on an idea alone. Massive blow. Without a technical co-founder, I was just another guy with an idea, and I still didn’t have anyone to build it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept thinking about it, and was convinced that this could be a thing, so eventually I decided I would find a way to build it myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
