From a young age, the small details would catch his eye. He would notice how headlights or spoilers would shift from model to model. His parents, as parents are wont to do, would encourage this instinct, reinforcing a mindset that would go on to form the foundation of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s appropriate that Wolfgang finds himself working for Volkswagen Group Charging—the VW Group’s energy and e-mobility initiative. As the VP of Design, Wolfgang leads the organization’s CX, design, and research for software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our interview, we discuss the importance of research in the EV space, the state of design leadership today, and design’s elusive “seat at the table.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;What role does research play in your design process at Volkswagen Group Charging?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s often clear to designers that research should be an integral part of their work. But that might not be the case for other areas of certain businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big part of what we are doing is educating people to understand why we’re doing research and why we should do research. Ultimately, if you don’t get the insights from customers or users, we’re just making random gut-feel decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is also fundamental when we talk about electric vehicles. At VW Group Charging, we look at users’ current behavior, such as how they charge their vehicles. Or if they’re switching to an EV, trying to understand how their day works. Ideally, we do this by shadowing them and observing what they do, how they behave, plan their days, or think about things like “range anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the insights to stakeholders to inform them. Because in the end, it’s not that design wants to decide on things. We want to work together to build the best product possible. With the right insights, we can make proper decisions and iterate. Whereas if you don’t do research, you would just be listening to somebody’s feelings or mood of the day. We would spend a lot of time planning, thinking, implementing, and building only to realize—maybe it doesn’t work the way we thought it would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the biggest problem facing design today? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned, especially on the B2B side, is that it’s not only important how a design looks or how an experience is. Designers also have to understand the business side of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to talk to respective stakeholders to make a point because how can we make a point and argue and discuss things if we only talk about pixels and how things look? You have to understand how this plays into what we do and build as a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are usually good at talking with users, but when it comes to stakeholders, it depends. I think there’s room for improvement there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice do you have for designers who want to get better at their craft? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the right decision is easier when we understand the problem the user is facing via research. To gather insights, let them influence the design, and inform stakeholders. Because, in the end, nobody is a villain. We all try to build good products, but we can only make decisions if we are well-informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why don’t we do more research?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easy answer is usually time and budget. But that’s the wrong answer because, in the end, it helps us save time and money. So, it should be the reason for doing research. Not the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes back on design to educate people about what we do. Depending on the company, this is where you talk about what design entails. It’s not just making things pretty as an afterthought. We start early. We want to be involved at the very beginning through research to make sense of things, understand our customers, and then feed this into the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you think about design leadership?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s essential to see not just the design, business, and engineering side of things but also the people side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are these people, why are they here, what is their goal, and how can we best use their skills? How can we work together in a way that we can achieve our goals while having fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice do you have for other design leaders? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try not to tell people what to do. I prefer to ask pointed questions, allowing people to find the answers and learn along the way. I wouldn’t necessarily give advice, but I would ask, “Why do you think you want to do that?” Because leading design often unfortunately doesn’t have much to do with designing directly anymore, but with all these other things going on. And if people enjoy doing that and “indirectly designing” via decisions, if they are good with people and have good common sense, then maybe it’s something for them. But I would start slow and grow into the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does design have a seat at the table?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends. Design wants a seat at the table, but design also has to earn the seat. If you are only doing design, then maybe you should not have a seat at the table. But if you can see things in conjunction with the business, product, runway, vision, competitors, and these kinds of things, then yes, you deserve a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overhyped or underhyped&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ask our guests about recent and some not-so-recent trends in design, product, and research. They have to answer one question—is it overhyped or underhyped?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parallax scroll&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s not overdone. Like how the Netflix app is designed. They have these beautiful cards with a shimmer on top where it almost sparkles. It reminds me of those limited edition DVD covers where you hold it to the light, and it shines a little bit. It’s really nicely done, but in a way that it’s not overwhelming. It’s there, but you only see it if you want to. If not, you probably won’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI in design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say overhyped at the moment, but in the long term, underhyped. There can be real benefits if you integrate it into your workflow. And by that, I don’t mean getting AI to create all the work for you but rather to help speed up a workflow or as a source of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark mode&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like dark mode for certain applications. I hate it for others. It was overhyped a couple of years ago. Maybe now it’s underhyped. But honestly, I’m kind of neutral on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a design point of view, sure, it’s wonderful. If you look at it from a business point of view, you’re left wondering how much money goes into translating an app or a piece of software from one into the other. I don’t even want to think about how much money goes into that. But in the end, do your users actually benefit from it? If yes, then you should probably do it. If not, then I would think about maybe reprioritizing. Because, in the end, it’s a feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big fonts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still underhyped. I’m a fan of big fonts if they make sense. They remind me of print design for magazines, where you can really &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; with things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bright colors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underhyped. Bright colors are really important, not only for catching the eye. You can build brands using beautiful, bright colors. Not everything has to be like a designer’s clothes—black. But anything can be colorful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What design trend are you looking forward to?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if it’s a design trend, but I’m curious about what’s happening in the VR and AR space. I’m curious to see if the technology will change things, and if yes, how would it change them? What would that mean for the design industry, and how could we build for these kinds of experiences?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A nuclear meltdown caused by design? ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/a-nuclear-meltdown-caused-by-design</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/a-nuclear-meltdown-caused-by-design</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Correction: We made an error in the previous version of this video and credited Robert Fabricant as the author of User Friendly.

They discussed the repeated friendship/relationship drama Lauren had experienced with other cast members. At one point, Lauren said, “It’s been years, so throughout the show, we’ve had problems with everyone.” Then David Letterman made a cringe-worthy observation: “Maybe you’re the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user/UX research world is full of talk about our stakeholders. And “stakeholders” usually come with a host of negative attributes: They don’t understand our work. They have no respect for data-driven or data-informed decision-making. They think they can do our work themselves and actually make decisions based on a “conversation with a customer.” They want to move too fast and don’t understand that research takes time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether at conferences, on LinkedIn, or with in-house teams or research colleagues, we bond with other researchers by bemoaning tough working conditions, clueless companies, and the frustrations of trying to “manage” difficult stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it struck me: what do these stakeholders think of &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;? By stakeholders, I mean the non-researchers we work with on a daily basis. They are often in product. Depending on the company’s size, they could also be in senior or executive leadership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, is everyone else the problem, or is it you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a research project waiting to happen—interviewing those who work with researchers about their experience working with researchers. But I started by turning it into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janelleward1_researchers-have-you-ever-considered-that-activity-7118199713467617280-9-vk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Researchers: have you ever considered that you might be the difficult stakeholder in your organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research community has countless articles, talks, and workshops centered on understanding our non-research stakeholders better and convincing them of our value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often lament how our company leadership doesn’t understand us and insist that the business would succeed if they would only see our worth and embody our perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But have you ever thought about what their perspective might be of you and your research work? How what focus/method/timeline you’re advocating for might be, in their view, harmful to their best interests?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got a slew of passionate reactions, ranging from defensive to reflective, with some case study examples and practical tips for good measure. Let’s run through what the community had to say about this line of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s our job to be the difficult stakeholder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidhamill/&quot;&gt;David Hamill&lt;/a&gt; kicked things off with a bang: “It’s your job to be the difficult stakeholder. Compliant researchers are as useful as chocolate fireguards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;David got a lot of support for this perspective. &lt;i&gt;We’re supposed to be the difficult stakeholder&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And David wasn’t alone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rlamego/&quot;&gt;Ricardo Lamego&lt;/a&gt; framed it similarly—being difficult is what you are hired to be. He told the story of a former role in which his manager saw feedback that he was “*really” difficult” as evidence that he was doing his job successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ricardo continued: “We need to stop apologizing for wanting to do our work properly. We must stop validating this mindset that we must ask for permission to do our jobs or justify it in the eyes of others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They make a solid point, which I have repeatedly heard from researchers. But does focusing on solid research to uncover the user perspective mean that it’s built in our DNA to be inherently “difficult”? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our work &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; inherently difficult in that we often challenge assumptions and expectations. When I wrote the post, though, I had something different in mind. It was more about taking the descriptors we use to represent the stakeholders &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; find difficult and flipping these around and imagining our non-research stakeholders saying these things about us: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“They don’t understand our work. They think they can do our work themselves. They want to move too slow and don’t understand that we need to move quickly.”&lt;/i&gt; And so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I wrote the post, I imagined it relating to empathy. Or, if that word doesn’t suit, it’s identifying with their challenges—being understanding of their time pressures and building rapport by learning a shared vocabulary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/landiantonia/&quot;&gt;Antonia Landi&lt;/a&gt; put it well…”As with any problem, trying to look at it from all sides will ultimately always put you in a better position to find a way forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at some other perspectives on this issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is “user focus” a great truth or our albatross? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s ask a slightly different question: Is our identification as the difficult stakeholder a problem that prevents us from accomplishing what we want in our roles? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/arinave/&quot;&gt;Ari Nave, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, thinks so. He said, “...researchers can often be myopic in the sense that they are totally focused on the user…But when researchers ignore basic elements of the enterprise, the constraints and conflicts and conflicting demands that the product teams and others face, they can come across as idealistic, unrealistic, and unhelpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari pointed out that, as researchers, we operate within a business framework. No matter how much we prefer, our research cannot be conducted and shared without considering the company’s realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawtonpybus/&quot;&gt;Lawton Pybus&lt;/a&gt; shared an anecdote that focused on how non-UXers perceive us. He asked a non-UXer about the talks at a UX conference who told him they observed “a theme of ‘We have the Truth, everyone else needs to fall in line.’” Well, that’s confronting, isn’t it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A solution in truth-seeking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/davieslauraj/&quot;&gt;Laura Davies&lt;/a&gt; takes the perspective of ruefully admitting, yes, we can be difficult. She points out, “...research can be the bad news bearer surfacing things that the org doesn’t want to address or that a stakeholder knows won’t be received well by their leadership. It’s really a balancing act unless the culture is comfortable with warts and all research.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can be difficult. And we can accept this &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; embrace the balancing act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2008/10/lauren_conrad_on_letterman.html&quot;&gt;Lauren Conrad drama&lt;/a&gt; mentioned at the beginning of this article in Annie Duke’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/552885/thinking-in-bets-by-annie-duke/&quot;&gt;Thinking In Bets&lt;/a&gt;. In the book, Annie Duke brings up the conversation between Lauren Conrad and David Letterman as an example of how &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;to conduct a truth-seeking exchange. Duke &lt;a href=&quot;https://admiredleadership.com/resource/thinking-in-bets-making-smarter-decisions-when-you-dont-have-all-the-facts/&quot;&gt;defines truth-seeking&lt;/a&gt; as “the desire to know the truth even if it does not align with the beliefs we hold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Letterman provided Lauren Conrad an insight that she had not solicited in an inappropriate forum. Annie Duke concludes that for this to have been effective (which it was not, as Lauren responded defensively), both parties would have needed to agree to the discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I made the same mistake in my LinkedIn post. Even researchers who “seek truth” as a key part of their calling may not want to hear this alternative perspective. It’s understandable: our jobs are tough. We feel undervalued. Who wants to hear more bad news? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it again, even if it rubs you the wrong way: Have you ever thought about your non-research stakeholders’ perspective of you and your research work? How what focus/method/timeline you’re advocating for might be, in their view, harmful to their best interests?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’re willing, researchers, let’s focus on our expertise but also understand the perspectives, needs, and incentives of other stakeholders within the organization. Finding a balance between bringing our expertise as a valuable contributor and sometimes delivering tough news is challenging, but we can do it—it’s part of our mindset. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From detractors to promoters: PMs create better products when they become their own customers]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/pms-create-better-products-when-customer</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/pms-create-better-products-when-customer</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A lesson that’s stuck with me from my startup days is that you will struggle to acquire new customers if your current customers are unhappy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every third customer our organization had would trash our brand on social media. They’d say we fooled them or wasted their time. That hurt us; worse, we didn’t know how to rebuild trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me share a story about how we moved from a startup many people hated to a service many saw as their best alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we delivered customer value&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling cars in Brazil can be stressful. One needs to deal with all the tedious paperwork while running the risk of getting scammed. Two young founders noticed that and tried to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value proposition was simple. We sell your car in an hour. You come to us. We put your car on our auction platform, where car dealers all over Brazil compete. After 45 minutes, we present you with an offer. When you accept it, we wire you the money, and you go home by cab. In case you reject the offer, no hard feelings. You don’t pay anything and drive your car home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could go wrong? Well, more than we could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What drove our customers mad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was my third day in the office, and out of the blue, a colleague came out of the negotiating room shouting profanities. Just minutes before, a customer wrote an Apple Store review, “This company sucks! I came here to get an offer for my car, but instead, they insulted me with an offer that wouldn’t even buy an old motorcycle! Don’t ever come here! They will waste your time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the coming days, I noticed this was the norm, not the exception. Something was dramatically wrong. So I decided to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming from the corporate world, I realized I couldn’t get data to understand what was happening. Whenever I wanted to know what occurred during the auctions, I had to access MongoDB and run queries. I found nothing insightful. So, I tried something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How empathy untrapped us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, I decided it was time to sell my car and rely on public transport. I wanted to live a different lifestyle and reduce my living costs. Something clicked. I worked for a startup that helps with this exact problem. So, I became the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I quickly became annoyed by the inspection process. First, because after five minutes, I got no confirmation email, and after 10 minutes, I received three. I hate useless emails. Yet, it got worse. I got a call to confirm my appointment two days before the inspection, which I did. Then, another call a day before and a third call on the day. Honestly, I thought about not going at all. It wasn’t a mystery why our no-show rate was 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I arrived at the inspection point, a kind person greeted me, and I handed over my key. She offered me coffee and said I’d hear back in about 45 minutes. I watched the other customers while I waited. It was funny being a customer and an employee. I started observing people chatting about their waiting times, and some were clearly annoyed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be first in, first out, but in reality, it was messy. Nobody kept me notified while I waited. After 63 minutes, I was called to receive my offer. My mood had deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your car has seven defects that devalued the offer considerably, but given the cost of the identified issues, our offer is the best you can get,” said the negotiator. I rolled my eyes, “Is that how you start all your conversations?” Surprised, the negotiator said, “I’m being transparent with you, sir. I can offer you 55 percent of the market value.” I didn’t reply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took my keys and walked away. I was sure I would never come back. I already had an offer of 80 percent of the market value and felt bullshitted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we moved from detractors to promoters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming a customer, the problems were obvious:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The no-show rate was high because we contacted customers more than we should&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our process lacked transparency, and we left customers wondering what was going on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t have anything close to the fair offers we promised&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We failed to respect those who arrived earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw how bad our service was, so I shared what I learned with others. They doubted me, so I recommended that they do the same. A few people also became the customer, and the patterns were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We addressed the quick wins first. Some bugs triggered multiple emails, which was a quick fix. We also adapted the process to avoid calling customers three times. The no-show rate immediately dropped from 50 percent to 25 percent, a massive gain. The operations managers changed the inspection process to respect those who arrived first, contributing to fewer angry customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, we had a big problem: unfair offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what was going on, I looked to the car dealers. They barely engage with our auctions, and the reason was simple. They missed almost all of them because they simply didn’t know when auctions took place! Solving that was also simple: we created a wish list and updated dealers as their desired cars became available. This feature increased our average bids by 300 percent, leading to better offers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge we had was the “pointing fingers” issue. Nobody likes hearing their car is bad; customers feel fooled. So, we added transparency in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV: A dashboard with all cars, status, and a continuous update on auctions (without numbers). We also showed the number of dealers online and bids per minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App: We added a feature so customers could see how many dealers were looking at their cars, how many placed bids, and the defects encountered. That helped customers know what the car looked like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people saw dealers attending auctions but ignoring their cars, they understood something was off. They became open to talking about their vehicles. Also, negotiators would ask customers what they thought about the auction instead of telling them how bad the car was. On top of that, we increased dealers’ participation and could finally offer a fair offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, our conversion rate more than tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the above actions, we no longer had 30 percent detractors. Instead, we had 30 percent promoters. You may wonder how long that took. That’s the beauty of startups. It took us just two months to do all the above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key takeaways &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear your customers’ shoes to understand their real pains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncover pain points, prioritize, and act immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break out from siloes and talk to everyone around you. Don’t let processes or abstract boundaries block you from learning from others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing other customers using your product or service can be pretty revealing. Our mistakes are often trivial, but the compound problem becomes considerable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to detractors because they represent your best chance to improve your product or services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Be careful: What the business wants isn’t always what customers need]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/business-wants-isnt-what-customers-need</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/business-wants-isnt-what-customers-need</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how to distinguish business wants from customers’ needs took me a while. While the lesson cost me a few bitter failures, it was worth it. Today, I can quickly sense when something is off, and teams are going in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me share a success story where curiosity saved the day despite everything being set up to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reading Between the Lines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start-ups are unique places. I love striving to create something new and disrupt markets. It takes a lot of courage to embrace the unknown, and that inspires me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I joined a start-up as the Head of Product. It was a funny title. I was the only product manager, but later, I understood why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first day, the CEO astounded me. We met at a very unusual place for my onboarding—the hospital where his wife was recovering from food poisoning. He showed up soon after I arrived, and we went to a nearby cafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was mentally prepared for a long meeting, but our chat didn’t last more than seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO: “David. I will be brief. We have a culture of being straight to the point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: “Alright.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO: “We’ve got US$10 Million as seed investment, and we burn US$1 Million monthly. Raising cash takes around three months, give or take. Our objective now is to prove market fit to raise more investment. In short, we have six or seven months. Otherwise, you better start searching for a new job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: “That sounds challenging. Tell me what’s between us and market fit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO: “Great question. You know we help car owners sell their cars without the red tape. They come to us, and we make an offer in an hour. That’s possible because car dealers bid on cars they want through our mobile app. But the thing is that no matter what we do, they don’t engage with our app.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: “What do they say about the app?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO: “They hate it. They dislike the look and feel and miss almost all the auctions. Here’s your mission: Redesign the app so we increase engagement by 30 percent. I don’t want excuses. I want it done. Deal?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: “Got it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO: “I gotta go. We will talk in a month, and you can share your progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was tasked to redesign the app to increase engagement by 30 percent. Suddenly, my intuition kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the solution is wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Facing Reality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to understand how car dealers found cars they didn’t have. I wanted to organize a discovery round with the UX Designer and Tech Lead. This was in Brazil, so I was surprised that neither of them spoke Portuguese or were situated within the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you design something for someone you can’t communicate with? Well, someone had to talk to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a user researcher, but I’m a curious person. I left my comfort zone and crafted an interview script with the team. We agreed I’d visit ten car dealers during my first week and share what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first visit was the most interesting. As I arrived at the store, I prepared to present myself as the start-up product manager, but something else occurred to me. What if I pretend to search for a car I know they don’t have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Car Dealer: “Hello, how may I help you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: “I’m searching for a BMW Series 3 Sedan. I love this car.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Car Dealer: “Nice choice. It’s indeed a great car. I don’t have it now, but I might be able to find it. Give me 10 minutes. In the meantime, feel free to get a coffee or another refreshment. It’s on us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what the car dealer would do. First, he went to his 21-inch computer screen and searched for cars in portals. Then, he made a few calls. Although registered on our app, he didn’t bother checking it. After 15 minutes, he returned and said, “I’m sorry. I couldn’t find it, but I will call you back when I find it in a few days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited other car dealers, and the patterns became apparent. I switched between being a client and the product manager, and I learned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No dealer used their phone to search for cars. They all used desktops with big screens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They liked car auctions but disliked missing the ones they intended to participate in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They missed critical information in our car ads for making a buying decision&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They dislike car apps because the screen is too small for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Having the Guts to Go Against Your Boss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was clear to me that our app wouldn’t work as expected. I had to make a choice. Follow my boss and blame him once we screw up, or do what’s right and inform him after we reach results. I chose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I shared the results with the team, we experimented with a few things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/b&gt;: We didn’t have time to assemble a complete web platform, but we could quickly set up a WordPress website to manually add cars and invite a few dealers to use it. We tested this solution with 20 dealers, who engaged 50 percent more than on mobile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concierge&lt;/b&gt;: We suspected dealers had a wishlist and would compete for the cars they wanted. So we asked 20 dealers to assemble a car list they liked, and we’d call them whenever the vehicle was in auction. This got quite popular, and dealers made high offers for those cars, leading to a high conversion rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ran the above experiments for two weeks. We made a few tweaks and concluded it was worth combining a web platform with a wish list. We adapted the app to enable dealers to set a wishlist and receive notifications when their desired vehicles were in auction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Results Talk Louder Than Words&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took us around two months to roll out the solution to everyone. Yet, the engagement doubled a month later and tripled four months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO was getting ready to raise more funds and wanted to know how the team redesigned the app. When I told him we discontinued auctions in the app, he shouted, “Are you out of your mind? That’s not what I told you. The world is becoming mobile. Oh man, the investors will eat me alive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calmly, I said, “Listen to me for a minute. &lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; world is mobile, but the car dealers’ one is not. Our solutions are growing considerably due to word of mouth. You gave me a goal and a solution, and I focused on the goal. You can tell the investors the story of what we learned and how we tripled engagement in four months by doing what’s natural instead of what’s rational.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, we had another US$50 Million invested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow goals, not solutions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do what’s suitable for your customer, not for you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be brave and listen to your gut even when that contradicts your boss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create solutions that are natural for your customer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your product discovery is probably fluffy and unhelpful]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/product-discovery-fluffy-unhelpful-change</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/product-discovery-fluffy-unhelpful-change</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Too many product managers and designers complain their companies should take product discovery more seriously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We should be more product-led.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“If only we listened to our users more.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Why don’t my stakeholders listen to our customer insights?!”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They complain, complain, complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rarely take responsibility for not just how they &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; product discovery but how they &lt;i&gt;package&lt;/i&gt; that product discovery work in a way stakeholders value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will address why most product discovery is fluffy and unhelpful before outlining three specific principles you can follow to ensure your product discovery work delivers results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is fluffy product discovery?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand some of the mistakes around product discovery, let’s start by defining the term correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Product discovery” refers to the process used in business and marketing to identify and understand the potential products or services that can be offered to meet market demands or solve customer problems — a ChatGPT definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I refer to “fluffy” product discovery, I mean there are no clear, actionable insights within that discovery work to act upon. It’s all mixed up together. Hard to separate different threads, obfuscating the key, unique insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the key insights are hard to identify and act upon, that product discovery work is simply unhelpful. It doesn’t help you make better product decisions as a product team or product org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether your product team does that discovery work or you work with an independent UX Research team uncovering those insights, the root cause of why product discovery work gets fluffy is usually the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A misunderstanding (or wilful ignorance) of what product discovery really entails.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, not just “to identify and understand” within your product team—but to help the rest of the organization and, specifically, key decision-makers identify and understand the insights that will drive the products and services you offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it is all a waste of time—it’s product discovery theater—if you cannot translate unique insight into making better product decisions across the organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means &lt;b&gt;you must take responsibility&lt;/b&gt; not just for the identification of insights but how those insights are packaged and communicated to your stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Make Product Discovery Un-Fluffy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking responsibility for your product discovery work delivering value means making it as actionable as possible for your stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there are three key principles to follow to make that happen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand your internal target audience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantify qualitative data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business value &amp;gt; user value &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into each one (or should I say, &lt;i&gt;Dovetail&lt;/i&gt; in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Principle #1: Understand your internal target audience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every product should have a clear target audience. Everything from your website copy down to our feature decisions should be with our specific target market in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for product discovery work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should have a clear target audience in mind and a clear outcome you want to achieve when communicating with that audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With product discovery, that usually means you want to influence that audience to listen to the insights you have uncovered—and make product decisions based on those insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing new there, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the big mistake discovery teams make?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really understanding their target audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When presenting discovery work, you will usually pitch to senior business leaders. In a small startup, that might be the CEO. In a large org, maybe a senior product leader, someone from sales, another from finance, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That audience probably doesn’t want to hold an hour-long chit-chat about the interesting psychology of your target market. Or the intricate details of the usability challenges you’ve uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instead, they want clear, concise, actionable insights to help them make better decisions&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than a long, generic presentation you present to all your stakeholders, you should &lt;i&gt;customize&lt;/i&gt; that presentation to what the audience needs to know and what helps you achieve the outcome you defined for that audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; If presenting to your CFO, focus on insights that will impact the company’s finances. If presenting to your CPO, focus on insights that might affect other product teams and highlight new product opportunities those teams are not addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This requires work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summarize your work, customize it, and enrich it with quantitative data sprinkled with a few concrete, memorable qualitative stories to help you make your point—rather than lazily sharing every detail of every user interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Principle #2: Quantify qualitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big mistake teams make when sharing insights with stakeholders is not quantifying their qualitative user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some teams share entire user interview transcripts with their stakeholders, expecting them to read through pages of notes! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others expect their stakeholders to sit through a 30-minute recording of each user interview!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders simply ignore this info—or switch off if you share it in a live presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And rightly so! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who’s got time for that?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, take responsibility for “quantifying your qualitative data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the example of sharing user interview insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Product Managers I coach, I suggest using the following template for this (rather than sharing pages of interview transcripts):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the full template &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/miroverse/product-thinking-board/?social=copy-link&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the key elements of this template: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use the same questions for every interview&lt;/b&gt;: This means you will have notes from every interview for each question. This, in turn, means you can visually identify trends across the interviews (for example, common challenges preventing these users from solving their problems. This means we can start quantifying those challenges). Don’t read the questions off a script like a robot. Just make sure you thread them into the interview in some form at some point&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For each interview, only add three to four important notes per question:&lt;/b&gt; It’s unrealistic to review pages of notes after each interview. Better to focus on key points you can quickly identify and aggregate into themes after a batch of interviews. Color-code the notes for each person (e.g., John = dark blue). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve conducted the interviews:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For each question, identify the common themes that came up and aggregate these&lt;/b&gt; by dragging related notes over to the board on the right-hand side (for example, if three people complained about “struggling to find motivation” in some form, group these notes together)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Count how often each frustration came up &lt;/b&gt;(for example, say we interview fitness enthusiasts about their health. We could write “struggling to find motivation” came up in seven out of ten interviews)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rate the perceived acuteness of the frustration&lt;/b&gt; from one to five (for example, “Four out of five because we believe this is something they worry about every day and prevents them achieving their fitness goals”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives you a clear, visual overview of your user interviews with minimal work. More importantly, it also means you can quantify those qualitative data (quotes, notes, summarized points that came up) in clear, easy-to-share themes. &amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For example&lt;/b&gt;: “The problem of ‘&lt;i&gt;struggling to find motivation&lt;/i&gt;’ came up in seven of the ten interviews. This acute (rated four out of five) problem represents a big opportunity for our business…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, you don’t need to do all of this manually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; to transcribe, analyze, and uncover themes from your user interviews, then great. This will save you a lot of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool doesn’t matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome does: moving from sharing masses of notes to clear, quantified insights to share with your stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Principle #3: Business Value &amp;gt; User Value&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In product, we love talking about the user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s be ‘&lt;i&gt;user-centric&lt;/i&gt;’! We need to ‘&lt;i&gt;build for the user&lt;/i&gt;’!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But this is only part of our job.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of any product person is to, yes, &lt;i&gt;deliver&lt;/i&gt; value for the user. By doing so, we hope to build something they actually get value from—hopefully, something they love—and, therefore, stick around to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we also need to &lt;i&gt;capture&lt;/i&gt; some of that value for the business in the form of revenue and, ideally, get enough revenue to be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, product people tend to forget the second part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when they share product discovery insights with stakeholders, they just share the raw insights, thinking only of why they are important&lt;i&gt; to the user&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For example&lt;/b&gt;: “We’ve discovered that seven out of ten fitness enthusiasts struggle to motivate themselves, even when they hire a personal trainer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should I care as a stakeholder?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, try to reframe that insight in business terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For example&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;“We’ve discovered that seven out of ten fitness enthusiasts struggle to motivate themselves, even when they hire a personal trainer. Consider they spend ~$100 per session, which means ~$400 per month per target customer. We’ve uncovered that most are actively looking for an alternative, so we can capture at least $400/month per user if we position ourselves as a better alternative. Even more, if we are really able to solve that user need more effectively than the existing solution.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example prompt you can put into ChatGPT to get these figures:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“How much is our target customer of [insert target market] spending per month on solving [insert problem]? List specific solutions they currently use and the amount spent (in dollars) per solution.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or see if you can pull exact figures from your user interviews!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need an MBA to add concrete monetary figures to these insights. The more you can understand and provide logical figures for important business terms like expected revenue per user, lifetime value, cash flow, etc., the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to start, add a ballpark figure to show you understand that product is not just about the user &lt;b&gt;but also about the business&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will build trust, meaning your stakeholders are more likely to translate your insights into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complaining that nobody takes your insights seriously or that “we should be more customer-centric” won’t help you, your career, or your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluffy product discovery is why product discovery has a bad name in many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s vague. It’s unhelpful. It’s not leading to better business results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, make product discovery as actionable as possible by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your internal target audience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantifying qualitative data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding business value &amp;gt; user value &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll quickly see stakeholders respect you more, trust you more, and ultimately, make more decisions based on your insights. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fogg’s model: A simple behavior model that’s actually useful]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/foggs-model</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/foggs-model</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’m not a fan of most UX models and diagrams because they’re either too complex to be useful, or I never seem to be in a situation where I can apply them. But Fogg’s Behaviour Model is one of the models I return to most in my work as a UX consultant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never used it or heard of it, then let me explain it to you. I’ll also give you some examples of its application in UX and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;We’re often working on a behavior &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX professionals are often trying to help more people do a thing. That thing might be converting sales, newsletter sign-ups, online passport applications, booking a restaurant table, or whatever. That thing is a behavior. We’re also working at an interaction level at times. Those interactions are also behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fogg’s Behavior Model can be applied to almost any situation where you’re thinking about whether that behavior will or won’t happen and what you can do about it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fogg’s model explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fogg’s model tells us that for any behavior to occur, motivation and ability must be high enough at the moment of experiencing a prompt. When motivation and/or behavior are too low at that moment, the behavior will not occur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;B=MAP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Prompt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the diagram above, the Action Line is the threshold between the behavior occurring and not occurring. Some behaviors happen despite low levels of ability because the user’s motivation is high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, users with low levels of motivation might still perform a behavior that’s very easy to do. But your users (or potential customers) are usually scattered across this graph in different positions for any given behavior. Some are near the action line at the moment of a prompt, others are well beyond it, while others still are far away from ever performing the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ability has two sides&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When thinking about ability in terms of user experience, think of both sides of ability. Consider the domain knowledge and the capabilities of individual users but also how difficult the behavior is to perform. You can target the relative differences in the capabilities of different types of users. But you can also enhance ability by making the behavior easier to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some applications of the model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how I’ve applied Fogg’s model and where it’s helped me provide explanations to my clients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Reducing friction to increase conversions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you reduce the friction in an online process, you increase the user’s ability. The behavior becomes a bit easier for users to perform. If there are a number of people hovering near the Action Line, then your interventions to reduce friction in an experience can move them across the Action Line. A lower level of ability is needed to perform the behavior, and therefore, more people will perform it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, the reduction of friction has no impact, so why is that? You’re not fixing the issues that impact people close to converting. If you make something a little easier for a customer having a nightmare with every aspect of your online process, then the slight reduction of friction won’t help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you understand the things that block people who are nearly converting, fixing those things is more likely to impact your conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Why startups often talk to the wrong users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-stage startups and innovative products are first adopted by people with high motivation and/or ability to adopt them. These people either feel the problem very strongly and/or are motivated to try new ways of doing things in this space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tech Adoption Lifecycle calls these people “Innovators.” It makes the mistake (in my view) of assuming they are all tech enthusiasts. But in my experience, some are just people with a painful problem. This pain motivates them to try a product that many other people wouldn’t have the motivation to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work on an innovative product and are trying to work out how to make it more accessible to the masses, you need to consider that your existing users are higher on the motivation and/or ability axis than the people you hope will adopt the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to understand more about the people close to adopting the product. Making changes to the product that accounts for their needs is likely to have a better impact. When startups continue to build for their first users, they often build a complex product that’s hard for others to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Why conversion rates often drop when traffic goes up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When companies are new to A/B testing and experimentation, they often make the mistake of thinking that their conversion rate is constant and will only fluctuate with changes to the design. They believe that doubling the traffic will double the overall conversions, for example. But that’s not how it works, and Fogg’s model helps us understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your conversion rate is determined by the motivation and ability of the traffic that your website/product receives. When that is stable, then so is your conversion rate. UX improvements enhance the ability of the existing users (traffic) by making converting easier and sometimes by motivating them a bit more. But when the mix of your traffic changes, then so will your conversion rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending a heap of money on Facebook ads might increase traffic but also decrease the conversion rate. This is because your extra traffic will likely have lower levels of motivation for the task at hand. These aren’t the same type of people who found their way to your product of their own accord. Instead, you pulled them toward it, and therefore, their levels of motivation and ability will generally be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, traffic does go up, as well as the conversion rate. This might happen seasonally. For example, a tax-efficient financial product (like a pension) might experience higher conversion rates and higher traffic near tax year end because a lot of very motivated people with a time deadline hit the site at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Understanding different types of innovation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes group innovations into one of two categories when thinking about them. Are they like contactless payment cards, or are they like Google/Apple Pay? The difference I’m talking about is how seamlessly users can adopt them. One type of innovation requires more motivation to adopt than the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contactless card type of innovation requires low levels of motivation to adopt. This is because adoption slips seamlessly into the customer’s existing workflow. When you got your first contactless payment card, it just came as a replacement for your current card. You just had to pay with it to activate it using the same machines you always did. Instead of entering the card into the machine, you simply tapped the card on the top of the machine. Ability is very high because it’s the same as what you always do. Therefore, even people with low motivation might adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google/Apple pay type of innovation requires the user to deviate from their existing workflow to set up. They need to add a card to an app on their phone and start paying in a different way than they used to. Changing an approach requires more effort; therefore, innovations like this require more motivation for users to adopt. I finally set up Google Pay the day I was on a bike ride paying for coffee, and the card I’d brought declined. This was an embarrassing situation I didn’t want to repeat. Several years after using contactless payment cards, I eventually set up Google Pay. My motivation had never been high enough before then. Motivation is also hampered by concerns about the new way we’ve never tried before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these examples are successful innovations. But, failed innovation ideas sometimes do the job better than the existing approach. They just demanded too much of a change of the user’s existing workflow to adopt. Potential customers weren’t motivated enough to change their way of working, even if the innovation idea did the job a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prompts don’t have an axis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that prompts don’t have an axis on the graph. I don’t find Fogg’s Model actually helps too much in shaping the design of prompts. Your prompts can affect motivation differently, but the model doesn’t help here. However, It shows us that the more prompts there are for different people, the more of the behavior there is likely to be. So long as the extra prompts fall within the action line that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking about prompts, think about how motivation and ability can be at different levels for different people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Zooming in and out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, these examples illustrate that Fogg’s Model can be zoomed into the interaction level but also zoomed out to the very existence of the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the statistician George Box said on the year I was born (you’ll need to Google that to see how old I am)...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;“All models are wrong, but some are useful.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s often the simplicity of a model that makes it both useful and wrong. By cutting away at the unhelpful complexity, it becomes something we can actually use. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From gut feel to facts: a user-centered guide for product people ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/from-gut-feel-to-facts-a-user-centered-guide-for-product-people</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/from-gut-feel-to-facts-a-user-centered-guide-for-product-people</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Product professionals often feel overwhelmed by the prospect of getting to know their users and stressed when it comes time to triangulate all of the user insights that come from different places—user research, data analysts, management—everyone has an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who knows the users? Do you? Do I? It starts to feel more philosophical than practical, so we nod our heads about how important it is to &lt;i&gt;get to know our users&lt;/i&gt; and move through our daily tasks, unsure how to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to come right out and say it, even if it means losing some friends: “We need to get to know our users better” is the biggest platitude circling the halls of every Product department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might sound strange coming from a User Research Lead, given that I spend my days at Lightricks collecting insights about our users and target audience, but hear me out: constantly nudging your product team to “get to know their users” is vague and, therefore, somewhat meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command results in half-hearted discovery work (once-a-week user interviews, anyone?). User interviews are &lt;i&gt;definitely &lt;/i&gt;a good idea, but this is really beside the point if our end goal is helping our product teams create better user experiences in service of company goals and KPIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the point? The point is that to do good product work. We don’t need our product professionals to get to know our users generally. We need them to &lt;i&gt;ask intelligent questions about our users at the right time and know where to go to get the right answers.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no one at your organization knows everything there is to know about your users, everyone knows &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. If product people can distill the right questions about users for every task at hand, whether it’s a simple UX iteration or long-term planning, and ask the right questions of the right people, they’ll be doing user-centered product work.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the super duper product manager who diligently reads the Customer Success weekly reports and conducts user interviews undoubtedly sharpens their sense of the user base over time and should be encouraged to keep it up—that sixth sense that they’re developing doesn’t fuel user-centered product development enough to create a winning product strategy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three ways you, as a product professional, can move past the vague directive of “getting to know your users” and actually do user-centered product work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;For every task, write out what you need to know about your users &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you feel like you have great intuition about your user base, you’ve likely found yourself staring at a PRD or in a planning meeting and not being 100 percent sure what to do next. This is because having a general sense of your users versus knowing the specific things you need to know to make particular product decisions are really and truly different things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to do this is to forget how well you generally know your users, and for each task at hand, write out what you need or want to know about users to make good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say you’re working on an iteration of an important workflow your team thinks is a core part of the user experience. Your list of questions may look something like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where in the current flow is the biggest drop-off? Do different user types drop off at different points in the flow? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;To what extent is this flow crucial for our power users? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do users articulate their challenges with the current flow?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are there specific UX issues in the flow?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do users use other tools to compensate for an unmet need in this specific flow? Why?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While writing out your questions may feel like a time investment, it’s the first step in really doing user-centered work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Think critically about who can answer each of your important questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll say it once more because it’s worth a repeat: no one at your organization knows everything there is to know about your users, but everyone at your organization knows &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; about your users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When making product decisions, you need to go question by question and find the right address. It’s not about going up the ladder and assuming that as you go up, people know the answers to the specific questions at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While every organization is different, here is some information on common teams and individuals and some examples of the type of information they often know about users—or that they can find out for you using their skill sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you make the articulation of relevant questions about users a part of your routine, over time, you’ll learn exactly who to go to in order to get the information that you need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Build your knowledge about users over time with this methodology rather than “get to know your users” in general&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fun part about asking good questions about users and learning where to go to get good answers is that doing this over and over again is the secret to getting to know your users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing other discovery work over time is a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; good idea when you can fit it in, but the reality for most product managers is that there is never enough time in the day to do as much user-oriented discovery as they feel they should—and anyway, this general discovery never builds as much nuanced knowledge about users as a more tactical approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When all of your product work involves articulating important questions about users and the internal sleuthing to get the right answers, over time, you’re building a nuanced sense of who your users are and how best to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best product professionals aren’t the ones who generally know their users better; they’re the ones who know how to ask and answer good questions about users as they work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a User Research Lead, I often hear from stakeholders that they want my team to do broad research to get to know our users better. I have to explain that our job isn’t to do the vague work of getting to know our users in general, which is my least favorite product platitude, but rather to answer specific and tactical questions about our user base as needs arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because there will never be one source of absolute truth about the everchanging, complex nature of human beings—no matter how specific your target audience. Things like personas can be helpful, but they’ll never tell you everything that you need to know for every product decision you need to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to serve your users and KPIs, your best bet is to get good at asking the right questions at the right time and knowing who to go to get the right answers. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Should we end research projects? ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/should-we-end-research-projects</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/should-we-end-research-projects</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Collaboration between product and research is an ongoing discussion, which often centers on the distinction (and the debate) between research as a tool and research as a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: research as a tool is valued in organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The not-so-good news: research as a role is still struggling to find its best manifestation. What can researchers—professionals who have made research their occupation and built their careers around this role—do to thrive in organizations? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been exploring possibilities to rethink the research role in organizations. A caveat: As with much of my writing, this is a thought experiment. It’s meant to pull the discussion out of its usual directions and consider new possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janelleward1_what-if-research-projects-ceased-to-exist-activity-7113451374784180224-zo9s&quot;&gt;I posted&lt;/a&gt;: What if “research projects” ceased to exist? And researchers instead focused on building operations? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let’s start with definitions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is “research”? What is a “project”? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabianboehm/&quot;&gt;Fabian Boehm&lt;/a&gt; dives in by pointing out the most obvious thing we haven’t agreed on: definitions. He says, “I like that you put both ‘research’ and ‘project’ in quotation marks because there is no ubiquitous definition within our industry, a sector, an organization, or often even a team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research” is an easy one for researchers. That’s our expertise, and we have clearly defined guidelines for what constitutes research. For what, in our view, is rigorous and well-scoped enough to be defined as research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can we say we agree with everyone in our field? Or what if the definition of research is not agreed on within our organization? Or if other professionals in our organization are conducting activities similar to research that don’t meet our definition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what about “project”—surely, that’s also defined differently from person to person and within organizations. For example, would a PMP-certified project manager approve of how we run our research projects? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is not to propose definitions. It does aim to point out what Fabian also points out—that we don’t agree on these things. Perhaps within our field, we do, but certainly not with our stakeholders. That’s probably a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s come back to the rest of Fabian’s comment later. There’s a more explicit question in the post: Leaving aside our definition of “project,” is taking a research-operations-first approach the way to go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could ops-first work in some organizations? It depends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my post, I questioned research’s “project-first” orientation. And in typical researcher fashion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisamaira/&quot;&gt;Elisa Maira&lt;/a&gt; replied, “It depends.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elisa focuses on an organization’s structure, looking at where an ops-first approach could work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in an organization where research activities are rather democratized, there is research buy-in, maybe a very small research team, and a willingness to establish both the research team and the craft, it might make more sense for research to focus on an “ops-first” approach, which will benefit the research team too once it grows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operations first is a possibility, but then research must already be highly valued in an organization. This makes sense: Establishing research operations is costly and time-consuming, but everyone—including the research team—could benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, it might sound promising, but we know it’s not that simple. A fundamental shift from project to operations-focused work is probably not the future of the field, especially since the complex question of research buy-in is still present. What else can we consider? My network had a couple of ideas—let’s start with shared project ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shared project ownership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about ownership of the project? I asked whether the “project” belongs to research in my post. Think about your last research project. What was the goal of the project, and which internal stakeholder(s) were most impacted by the insights? Why wasn’t it &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; project? On &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; roadmap? Is our declared ownership (even if shared) hurting collaboration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than handing off ownership to other functions, as I implied in my post, Elisa advocates for shared ownership in a project-oriented setting:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In such a setting, a project approach can come later, when there are more research hands, and I would say ownership should be as much as possible shared…it can (and should) coexist with a solid continuous research practice, in order to accommodate the rhythm of innovation, which should ideally be decoupled from a project mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project ownership is an issue Fabian also addresses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“UX Researchers…can provide value more effectively and show value easier in a product-based delivery mechanism rather than project-based delivery mechanism.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabian argues that domain knowledge comes through exposure to a product-based environment. This knowledge could be key to building trusting relationships between research and product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research operations facilitate nimble and continuous research, potentially speeding up research processes and making them more efficient. But let’s take it a step further. Let’s embrace a collaborative future. What if we moved entirely to a product-centric approach, led by product? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A product-led approach &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the proposal: Shift towards a product-led approach to research and development, where cross-functional teams are organized around specific products. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmeinen/&quot;&gt;Maryse Meinen&lt;/a&gt; details this in her comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What if we moved to a product-led, focused structure? One builds ‘cradle to cradle’ teams around products, including expertise like research development and operations. These truly cross-functional teams could research, innovate, build AND maintain sustainable products…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product led: I know this will send a shiver down many a researcher’s spine. Researchers often want to be autonomous. For good reason—if we can’t actively exercise our expertise, we feel disempowered and unable to perform our role to the best of our ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can this work? I asked Maryse to elaborate on whether she’d seen it succeed. “If you see every timebox as an opportunity to research, discover, and experiment, together you can. Good product development should, imho, mean ‘continuous discovery’,” she replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting on my researcher hat, I can think of another ingredient that must be present for this to work: Trust. Researchers will need to feel they can trust their cross-functional team—just as that team will need to trust them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: We all want research to succeed, but we need to consider the circumstances under which we are comfortable with it evolving. This might mean letting go of long-held ideas about research’s and researcher’s role in an organization. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Teardown of modern car design: What happens when usability is no longer a priority]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/what-happens-usability-no-longer-priority</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/what-happens-usability-no-longer-priority</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;I was in my car late last year when I decided to pop into a local sushi restaurant. I indicated, slowed, stopped, and prepared to reverse parallel park. Textbook maneuver. Unfortunately, the driver of the car behind obviously hadn’t read the same textbook and promptly drove into the back of me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extracting myself from my car and receiving a stream of apologies and explanations from the driver, I suggested that they park on the side of the road, and we exchange details. They agreed and, continuing to struggle with the safe operation of a car, promptly reversed into the car behind them. Two-nil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-in-all, it was a pretty shabby display of driving, and I never got my sushi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my car had been towed away, I realized I would be without personal transport for several months. Thankfully, my insurance company had provided me with a rental (or four different rental cars as it would transpire). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the subsequent months, I was treated to a smorgasbord of late-model cars that left me asking a number of questions ranging from the economics of insurance companies to the professional abilities of smash repairers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One question in particular, however, remained: why has the role of human factors taken a back seat in the design process of modern motorcars? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human factors as an engineering and design specialty has been around for decades. Broadly speaking, human factors is the application of psychological and physiological principles from various fields to the design of products and systems. An important part of human-factors engineering is designing for usability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, usability is hugely important in the design process, including everything from consumer electronics to the cockpit of an aircraft. Simply put, things that aren’t particularly usable usually aren’t very useful. For many, the consequences of poor usability amount to little more than frustration. In the case of a motorcar, usability issues could lead to serious injury or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I climbed into my rental vehicle—a late model Mercedes C-Class—I was struck by how many historically analog interfaces (speedometer, air-conditioning controls, etc.)the manufacturers had replaced with digital equivalents and touch screens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to understand the reasoning behind migrating to these types of interfaces. Perhaps the bean counters had determined that screens were cheaper and more reliable than physical buttons, knobs, and levers? Or perhaps the marketing and product teams concluded that motorists would perceive a touch screen as modern and superior to their analog ancestors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no doubt that the end product looks impressive and “hi-tech”—the result is far from usable. Tasks that used to be simple have now become unnecessarily burdensome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the climate controls as an example. When I got my license, I purchased a Ford Falcon, a trusty steed that, on a good day, ran on &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; of its six cylinders. The Falcon had a straightforward climate control panel consisting of sliders and buttons. This interface had the added benefit of allowing the driver to manipulate the controls fairly accurately without taking their eyes off the road. Each slider had a prominent knob, which allowed the driver to feel its location and deduce which function it controlled based on its relationship and proximity to the other sliders on the panel. Because these sliders were constrained in their track, the driver would receive instant physical feedback that they’d reached that function’s minimum or maximum range without looking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this to the large touch screen in the Mercedes. Every inch of the screen feels the same; nothing differentiates the feeling of one part of the screen from another. Accurate screen use requires users to &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; at what they are doing—not just &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt;. Every time I wanted to adjust the climate controls, I had to look away from the road and down to the screen, dramatically increasing the risk profile of the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How controls &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; has been a big part of control interface design for decades. The subtle differences in the shapes and textures of input mechanisms allow operators to utilize senses other than sight to interact with the correct input. This reduces the cognitive load for the operator and maximizes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/s/safe+operating+envelope.html#:~:text=Safe%20Operating%20Envelope%20is%20described,and%20corporate%20nuclear%20safety%20goals.&quot;&gt;safety envelope&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positioning and shapes of input mechanisms are important design decisions with safety implications. That’s why the brake pedal in automatic cars is big, and the accelerator is thin and narrow. Unintentionally braking tends to be less problematic than accelerating.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, mistakes occur, and drivers unintentionally push the wrong button or lever. When getting into an unfamiliar car, it’s not uncommon to activate the windscreen wipers when you mean to use the turn indicator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised that Mercedes had moved the gear selector from the console between the seats to the same location as a turn indicator. On multiple occasions, I reached for what I thought was the indicator only to put the car in neutral. Am I at fault here, or is it bad design? Probably both. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touch screens and gear selectors were not the limits of bizarre design decisions in modern cars. I was shocked to see how basic and somewhat timeless components such as door handles had been redesigned without any thought given to their usability.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the Tesla’s door handle. It sits flush with the car’s body and pivots to reveal a “grabable” handle when you push one-half of the handle. This unintuitive design is quickly defended by the Tesla faithful, who, after proudly justifying their purchase of what is essentially a golf cart with doors, will quickly tell you that these design decisions conclusively result in better outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have heard a few justifications for the door handles ranging from minimalism to aerodynamic benefits—the latter naturally being relevant in a suburban context while doing the school run.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I went to get into a friend’s Tesla, and almost instinctively, they started explaining how to use the door handle. While I might not look particularly intelligent, I have never previously required instruction on how to open a car door. Yet, on this occasion, I actually did need help—I couldn’t deduce how the handle worked by looking at it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that I need not be embarrassed as other Tesla passengers also shared my difficulty in opening the doors. Indeed, some owners had gone to some lengths to avoid repeatedly telling their passengers how the door handles work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning, I pulled up beside a Tesla whose owner had placed large stickers around each door handle to explain how to open the door. These stickers, while no doubt maintaining the aerodynamic efficiencies pursued by Tesla drivers, did compromise the visual minimalism that the door handles might’ve achieved. Back to square one, it would seem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The door handles were hard to use because they lacked intrinsic information about how they worked. Donald Norman, a pioneer in User Experience, would probably say that these door handles lack &lt;i&gt;affordance&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his seminal text &lt;i&gt;“The Psychology of Everyday Things” (1988)&lt;/i&gt;, Norman states &lt;i&gt;“...the term affordance refers to the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used. [...] Affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things. Plates are for pushing. Knobs are for turning. Slots are for inserting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking: no picture, label, or instruction needed.”&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design principles like &lt;i&gt;affordance&lt;/i&gt; that Norman expands on in his work have been around for decades, and many have been utilized by industrial designers long before he wrote about them. So why have they been so readily dispensed with in recent years, particularly by car manufacturers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to think that some designers are just being lazy. A failure to test is undoubtedly a part of the problem, but I don’t think it’s just that. I believe there is a lack of education and awareness. Sticking a screen on something or pursuing aesthetics without regard to function and usability is short-sighted. At best, these decisions leave you in neutral at a roundabout. At worst, they can kill you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation will continue to challenge the design of everyday things, and that is a good thing. With new technology will come new interaction paradigms and modalities. Interface and product designers should embrace these challenges. Importantly, we must not see innovation and usability as a dichotomy. The research field of human factors has provided us with a wealth of resources to help work with emerging technologies to ensure they are both usable, useful, and safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designers failing to leverage this knowledge are simply negligent.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research by any other name: How should UXRs feel about discovery? ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-by-any-other-name</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-by-any-other-name</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janelleward1_uxresearch-userresearch-product-activity-7098205204784771073-Rje0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hey, researchers! Product has discovered research and is calling it product discovery. What are you doing to ensure that you encourage their enthusiasm, embrace their practices, and become familiar with their approach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, product managers! Product discovery isn’t new. Researchers have been doing this forever. What are you doing to connect to the researchers at your company/in your network before you reinvent the wheel?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I was being tongue-in-cheek. But I see these posts all the time: Product people starting from scratch with discovery practices when there’s already a whole field out there dedicated to this craft, and researchers acting surprised, shocked, and even offended that other people are practicing their craft by another name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get the feeling these two groups aren’t communicating much about how they view their roles, particularly the role research plays in their responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming from a research background, my followers fall more into the research camp. As such, their voices are represented here. But if you’re a product person interested in joining the conversation, there should be plenty of perspectives to chew on below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how did people respond to the post? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Identifying a (non)-existent research culture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinawli/&quot;&gt;Christina Li’s&lt;/a&gt; response mirrored a common theme among researchers. “The fact that discovery research is now taunted [sic] as the ‘new shiny thing’ may suggest there isn’t a research culture embedded in those companies,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies with no or few researchers haven’t established the necessary culture. Because that culture isn’t present, the practice of discovery &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, in fact, new to product managers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product or continuous discovery could be taking off in organizations without researchers. But given the response to my post, it seems it’s also happening in companies with a researcher or a research team. What’s a researcher to do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahroseknowles/&quot;&gt;Hannah Knowles&lt;/a&gt; has an idea: “I think this is an opportunity for UX Researchers to redefine their position. I hear of many researchers who want to work on ‘meatier’ overarching problems…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a popular argument: If product does continuous discovery, researchers can focus on more generative research projects that take longer to plan and execute but produce broader, more strategic insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is indeed an opportunity. But others had something else in mind—what if we focus on the potential joys of collaboration with product peers? If we want to embrace collaboration, we will have to let go of ownership. Let’s look at some examples of what commenters had to say from this perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration, not ownership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product people conduct “discovery,” and researchers do “research.” These activities differ in definition and rigor, but they all stem from the same activity: reaching out to users and customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdelmat/&quot;&gt;Julian Della Mattia&lt;/a&gt; reminded us that this practice researchers call research and product managers call discovery is not new. Neither group owns the concept. “I mean, Steve Blank was writing about Customer Discovery 20 years ago in his books. You know, ‘get out of the building,’” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep this in mind: We did not come up with the concept of using user and customer insights to build successful companies. And neither did product. Julian makes the broader point: “I think it’s a great chance for all of us to get together, see how we can contribute from our roles, and build this bridge we can all benefit from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/behzodsirjani/&quot;&gt;Behzod Sirjani&lt;/a&gt; agreed: “... I’d love for us to move beyond territory and semantic battles to figure out how we can all learn and make better decisions together...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ownership is a tricky road to go down. Who owns access to customers? Do you think everyone in your organization would have the same answer? More importantly, is that the challenge worth focusing on? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rstegbauer/&quot;&gt;Ruben Stegbauer&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the importance of collaboration versus ownership: “No single profession or employee group should have a monopoly on conducting research with users.” Imagine this perspective for a moment. What if we started from the premise of collaboration and forgot about ownership? How could things change? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can we move forward? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want a solution, right? I asked some of the commenters above to throw in their two cents on the following question: &lt;i&gt;What would be your number one suggestion for researchers looking to successfully collaborate with product within their organization?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruben already provided a great suggestion in his comment: “Experimentation is fine, too. But make it 100% clear it’s time-bound and reversible. Start small, maybe with one team, and then evaluate...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behzod told me, “I think the best thing researchers can do to collaborate with product as it relates to continuous discovery/research is help product realize that research should inform decision-making, not just ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://yetanother.studio/blog/the-mistake-almost-everyone-makes-when-doing-user-research&quot;&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; work with product to &lt;a href=&quot;https://yetanother.studio/blog/democratization-is-our-job&quot;&gt;align&lt;/a&gt; on what’s the right operating model in terms of what research should drive, versus where they collaborate, versus what is more self-serve for product.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s answer this question in the specific case where a company already has a researcher on board. Julian’s advice: “The first thing would be to understand where is this push for ‘product discovery’ coming from exactly, what’s the plan, and what’s the reasoning behind going this way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And is research involved in this process? Are they part of the discussion? Julian’s advice: “...address this head-on and discuss how researchers can help drive a continuous process, why it’s important that they are involved in it, and talk about the quality of the output and the standards that need to be met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s going to take flexibility and some give-and-take from both sides. Research and product? We both want the same things, and it’s beneficial to both groups to work together to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Treat it like a therapist: How to use AI to create more actionable insights]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-to-use-ai-actionable-insights</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-to-use-ai-actionable-insights</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the core functions of our role as researchers is to uncover and communicate actionable insights that help drive roadmap decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might sound like an easy task, but anyone who has done it knows how challenging it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting aside how much skill is involved in just parsing out research goals that align with business objectives across a diverse group of highly opinionated stakeholders—and putting aside the craft of designing studies that effectively extract the necessary data (balancing rigor and a multitude of resource constraints)—identifying those nuggets of novel observation and then communicating them in a way that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will actually get read, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will be understood, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge a broader context, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are specific enough to be actionable, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are broad enough to be durable over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a hugely time-consuming task. And that doesn’t even take into account the cataloging and easy retrieval of all that hard work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, since AI is the answer to everything that ails us these days, it seems only appropriate to explore how we might use it to streamline and improve this most basic—but essential—research task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also seemed appropriate to go full-on meta with this one and leverage AI to understand how we might leverage AI to build more actionable insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the theme, the lessons I learned were also more “meta” than actionable (but don’t worry, I learned some actionable lessons, too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Necessary caveat!&lt;/b&gt; To be clear, I am not a security expert or an expert in AI, but I know enough to err on the side of caution. Unless you are using either company proprietary AI models or an “Enterprise” plan or the AI provided via a purchased (and vetted) tool, there’s probably very little you can safely do without risking exposing confidential data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole point of identifying actionable insights is to uncover novel observations from data that lead to innovations. Sharing those novel observations—or worse, the source data from which you derive those observations—with an LLM learning from your data inputs is likely a security or privacy breach. The power of AI is profound, but be sure you are leveraging it safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on the journey, not just the destination&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, GenAI can provide shockingly good answers to almost any question. But so can Google. What a conversational assistant can do that Google can’t do is engage you in a reflective dialogue that helps deepen your understanding of a topic. Take my example—I started my research by asking ChatGPT a big loaded question head-on: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How might product teams leverage AI to build actionable insights that drive product roadmap decisions more effectively?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT’s response was a mishmash of marketing buzzwords, research methodologies, and vague pie-in-the-sky solutions. The response wasn’t wrong; it just wasn’t specific enough to be actionable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I decided to go back to basics and asked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How would you define a UX research insight?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, I received a response that would charm even the most cynical grade school English teacher. It included a short intro, bulleted criteria and descriptions, a handful of examples, and a lovely concluding paragraph to drive it all home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it was a pretty solid response. Maybe even annoyingly so. Okay, time to give it some nuance. This time, I asked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What makes a UX research insight actionable?  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another perfectly formatted response with some solid content, but this time, as I was scanning through the criteria, I came upon: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This caused me to pause and consider whether an insight involves only a description of the problem or if it includes a recommended solution as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, what I experienced as the real value of using AI, or conversational AI, wasn’t in asking a question and getting an answer. It was being in dialogue with the assistant to clarify my own thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know this by now, but ChatGPT is no genie in a bottle. It’s, in essence, a mirror that reflects back to us what “we” (the collective web-hood) have told it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Socrates to my therapist, this type of reflective introspection is an effective mechanism for garnering deeper understanding, illuminating inconsistencies, and identifying hypocrisies. All of these are necessary steps toward identifying actionable insights from data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, dialoguing with conversational AI about a research insight will likely yield a more durable, novel, and actionable insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diverge and converge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing effective and actionable insights is as much art as science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to distill countless hours of research into as short a description as possible—often only a sentence or two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, shorter stories take longer to write, and this is definitely true for writing insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversational assistant can be your best friend if you need help distilling a paragraph of text into a concise insight or for offering ways to rephrase an existing insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I was trying this out myself, it occurred to me that I could ask ChatGPT to provide me with even more value than mere editorial assistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could ask for suggestions that adhere to the criteria defined in our previous conversation for what constitutes an actionable insight (User-Centered, Contextual, Actionable, Novel, Impactful, Root Cause Identification, Data-Informed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Side note: is it possible that Clippy and ChatGPT are related?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my experiment, I knew I couldn’t use an actual insight from my work (I enjoy being employed). So, I turned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/uber-design/the-power-of-insights-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-new-insights-platform-at-uber-26f85becc2e6&quot;&gt;this article by Etienne Fang&lt;/a&gt; that I’ve referred to many times for help defining an insights framework. Etienne shares a “before” and “after” of an insight from her team. I thought it might be interesting to see how well ChatGPT can transform the “before” version using just our framework criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uber’s “before” insight:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some Uber Bus drivers stop receiving requests one hour before their shift ends so they can finish on time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which ChatGPT, with the enthusiasm of its long-lost paper clip cousin (“Certainly!”), converted into the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the first sentence is essentially a restatement of the original, ChatGPT identified that the original insight wasn’t “Actionable.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet this criteria, it added the second sentence. While perhaps not perfect, adding the second sentence might be a flag to the researcher that they haven’t quite nailed the essence of the insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identifying hypotheses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating truly actionable insights often requires combining data sets via multi-phased research plans. Engaging a conversational assistant to aid in identifying hypotheses throughout this process can help identify new opportunities for exploration, which will further refine the insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the above insight about Uber bus drivers. We know they aren’t taking ride requests about an hour before the end of their shift, but—based on the insight as written—we don’t know why. A conversational assistant might be able to help offer new hypotheses to explore.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these hypotheses can then be evaluated (whether with existing data or new research) to improve the usefulness of the associated insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next exciting moment will be when the conversational AI has access to our proprietary data, allowing us to organically and iteratively refine our insights based on what’s already known. Suggested actions will be rooted in prior knowledge, improving over time based on results from previous experiments. These repos-of-the-future will allow us to balance brevity and clarity with context and human-centeredness in our insights. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are we facing an AI-generated boom in privacy breaches? ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/ai-generated-privacy-breaches</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/ai-generated-privacy-breaches</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Joan Tait had a rough day at work. She laid off an employee, had a difficult therapy session, and ran into an ex. But things are about to take an unexpected turn. She returns home only to find that her existence is being continually monitored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her life is playing out for everyone she knows to see—almost in real-time—on a streaming service not so different from Netflix. The computer-generated show &lt;i&gt;Joan is Awful &lt;/i&gt;is created on the fly using artificial intelligence with a digital version of Salma Hayek as the protagonist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the storyline from a recent creepy episode of &lt;i&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/i&gt;. With echoes of &lt;i&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four’s&lt;/i&gt; Big Brother, the episode takes aim at the idea of continual surveillance and the privacy challenges AI could pose in the future. While it might seem dystopian, as AI becomes more prevalent, there are increasing concerns about its impact on privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are we heading toward mass surveillance? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/17/global-expansion-of-ai-surveillance-pub-79847&quot;&gt;2019 paper&lt;/a&gt; by the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace found that 75 countries already used AI surveillance. The AI-related activities included smart city platforms, facial recognition, and smart policing. While the author, Steven Feldstein, largely found that countries were using AI in ethical ways—such as to keep their citizens safe—other nations weren’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some autocratic governments—for example, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia—are exploiting AI technology for mass surveillance purposes. Other governments with dismal human rights records are exploiting AI surveillance in more limited ways to reinforce repression,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper raised concerns about the use of AI by governments, stating that it could change governing patterns and give unprecedented powers to governments to monitor citizens and use their private information to bias elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, French senators &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/france-looks-ai-powered-surveillance-secure-olympics-2023-03-23/&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; algorithmic facial recognition technology for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. It’s something that Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, has called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/03/france-intrusive-olympics-surveillance-technologies-could-usher-in-a-dystopian-future/&quot;&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Re-stocking security apparatus with AI-driven mass surveillance is a dangerous political project which could lead to broad human rights violations,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI data breaches and cyberattacks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal data issues are nothing new. Social media organizations have been under fire for years for their often unscrupulous data collection practices. TikTok, for example, has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://internet2-0.com/whitepaper/its-their-word-against-their-source-code-tiktok-report/&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; to perform “excessive data collection” that connects international data to China-based infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta’s privacy controversies are well-known, too. The social giant was at the center of the 2018 election scandal—in which they sold data to third-party Cambridge Analytica—a transgression that cost the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48972327&quot;&gt;$5bn in fines&lt;/a&gt;. And recently, in May 2023, Meta was fined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/22/meta-fined-1-3bn-for-transferring-eus-user-data-to-the-us&quot;&gt;$1.3bn&lt;/a&gt; for data misuse—specifically transferring European data to the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI progresses, there’s a risk that data breaches could become more widespread, even in the face of control and regulations. If secure data processes are not in place, that data could fall victim to security attacks—making it susceptible to misuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founding Director of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research and Optimization at Torrens University Australia, Seyedali Mirjalili (Ali), believes data breaches could occur where there are insufficient safeguards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The absence of proper safeguards in AI systems enables their malicious use. This can lead to the development of various cyber-attacks targeting victims’ computers and infrastructure, with the goal of unauthorized data access or compromising computing systems,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Anderson, previously Dynatrace and DataRobot, who’s worked with global organizations on their data and AI strategies and runs the AI podcast &lt;i&gt;Tech Seeking Human,&lt;/i&gt; shares the same sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI is designed by humans and fed by data from sources we determine. The most likely scenario isn’t that the AI will lead to a data breach. It’s more likely that the way in which we extract the data could lead to the data breach,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated, this is important. The use of AI in hacking isn’t a future worry but a current reality. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/12/26/ai-cyber-attacks-are-a-critical-threat-this-is-how-nato-is-countering-them&quot;&gt;to NATO&lt;/a&gt;, AI cyberattacks are already proving to be a “huge challenge.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy attacks may also become automated with highly-trained tools. AI may be trained to automate relentless social engineering programs to obtain sensitive information. It’s something that will require even more sophisticated AI protection systems to detect and prevent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/11/hacking-ai-cybersecurity-future/&quot;&gt;the case&lt;/a&gt; of the security firm Zscaler, which received a convincing scam call from the CEO asking for large quantities of money to be transferred. Fortunately, the company discovered that scammers had used AI to reconstitute the CEO’s voice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further concerns surround data being sold to or accessible to third parties—as was the case in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where it was used to persuade voters in the 2018 election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other cases, using deep fakes—convincing but phony images of videos—could ruin reputations and spread misinformation. The use of deep fakes in pornography, for example, is of concern. AI-detection and monitoring company Sentity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/business/key-sectors-for-business/artificial-intelligence/stories/sensity&quot;&gt;found that 95 percent&lt;/a&gt; of deep fake images are sex-related. They note, “...with increased sophistication, these AI-generated synthetic videos are also becoming increasingly difficult to detect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global AI cybersecurity market is growing and is expected to reach &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gitnux.com/ai-use-in-cyber-security-statistics/&quot;&gt;$38.2 billion by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. But will it be enough?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can be done to protect privacy? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For designers and developers of AI systems and those implementing AI into workflows, it’s critical to consider the risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dave Anderson, developers under pressure to produce more and more advanced AI systems presents a threat to ethical use of data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a race to get more powerful AI, developers are pushing the boundaries of ethical data capture, collating information, or pooling it, to get better outputs for the AI.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why it’s essential for those creating AI to do so ethically. Anderson recommends being transparent and ethical in data capture, transport, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali Mirjalili also highlights the need for rigid data collection processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anonymization, encryption, and access control are essential measures that can also assist AI developers and designers in enhancing data security and privacy,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Responsible development &amp;amp; deployment of AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design ethics must be front of mind for those who are developing, training, or onboarding AI tools. Socially responsible design, which considers the wider societal implications of design, is more important than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers, designers, researchers, and UX teams, this may be the most significant ethical challenge they will ever face. All AI tools should be created in alignment with socially responsible design ethics to ensure the privacy and safety of the wider community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While legislation will play a critical role in the sector, it’s important to recognize waiting for guidelines may take too long. The onus may lie with those building these products—especially where personal data is collected and used for training. For those people and organizations, ethical decision-making must take center stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Public advocacy for those developing AI &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and 1000 AI experts have signed &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/&quot;&gt;Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter&lt;/a&gt; advocating for a halt in the training of AI more powerful than GPT-4 for six months—until more is understood about the technology. The reason? The “profound risks to society and humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More voices are needed throughout the product community. As practitioners working with AI, there is the responsibility to learn, discuss, and assess the risks of such models—especially given the privacy of millions of people may be on the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocating for safe systems and speaking out when privacy may be at risk is essential as we move into unknown territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali Mirjalili claims developers must take ownership as they create AI models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I strongly recommend that AI developers actively educate themselves and raise awareness about data security best practices and privacy concerns. Involving cybersecurity experts during the development process can also help minimize risks by reinforcing AI models against cyberattacks,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legislation and standards &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, legislation may be critical in protecting users against data breaches. Governments are responsible for regulating the use of AI to minimize potential risks. But while many nations are discussing legislation, the process is slow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/u-s-state-legislative-bills-on-ai-a-mid-6921084/&quot;&gt;43 bills&lt;/a&gt; have been introduced to regulate AI development and deployment. To date, though, only some of those bills have become legally binding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kwm.com/global/en/insights/latest-thinking/summary-of-ai-regulation-around-the-world.html&quot;&gt;Pending legislation&lt;/a&gt; exists in the EU, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kwm.com/global/en/insights/latest-thinking/summary-of-ai-regulation-around-the-world.html&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has enacted a degree of AI regulation. Many other countries are considering legislation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethical principles will play an important factor, too. Australia has created eight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-framework/australias-ai-ethics-principles&quot;&gt;Ethics Principles&lt;/a&gt;, one of which is that: “AI systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection, and ensure the security of data.” Meanwhile, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-data-protection-board-discussing-ai-policy-thursday-meeting-2023-04-13/&quot;&gt;has created&lt;/a&gt; a ChatGPT task force. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.responsibleaiindex.org/&quot;&gt;Global Index on Responsible AI&lt;/a&gt; is currently being developed to support the safe implementation of AI globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI escalates, these measures may be too little, too late. Controls ought to be put into place now if we are to avoid an uncertain future. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The challenges of UX research in the age of AI]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/challenges-age-of-ai</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/challenges-age-of-ai</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a product team amid the current artificial intelligence boom, you’ve probably realized the age of steady and incremental product iterations with sturdy six-month roadmaps feels, in many ways, as though it’s in decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this is true and whether it’ll last is widely debated—but for those of us doing user research in the current environment, this &lt;i&gt;feeling&lt;/i&gt; presents some unique challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we’ve probably all been in several meetings where we were notified by the visionaries of our companies that AI was in the process of changing our industry for good and that we ought not to be left behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by now, you’ve joined me in the ranks of people who are excited and ready to take part in the moment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is different when it comes to UX research in the age of AI? How do we adapt to meet what are undeniably new organizational needs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is AI a product challenge?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can wake up tomorrow with unprecedented functionality, making it seem like today’s iteration is irrelevant. This matters to researchers because we work with stakeholders to meet user needs. Features and flows can be rendered irrelevant with the introduction of something new. We must consider if tomorrow’s developments present a better path to meet user needs and if we have to pivot to innovate rather than catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research around each new product initiative must be thought about in the context of technology that’s developing faster than you can finish your PRD—and that’s a real challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, AI-powered features often have a long way to go before they reach an optimal place. They generally get better and better as they evolve, but everyone in product knows a bad first experience often kills a user’s interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference now is that “bad experiences” for users are sometimes a result of the technology not being &lt;i&gt;quite there yet.&lt;/i&gt; Optimizing user experience isn’t like asking a developer to fix a bug or a designer to change the UX—it’s not within our control. But nobody wants to wait it out while we’re chasing our KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, many of us would agree we have never seen shiny object syndrome in our industry like we do today. Simply put, we know as researchers that just because something cool is &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t mean it solves an actual user need and will help us reach our goals. But how do we know when all of this new functionality is unprecedented? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, how can UXRs do their best work in the age of artificial intelligence?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightricks has been delivering innovative content creation experiences for more than a decade. Over the past year or so, we’ve transformed into an AI-first company innovating even more rapidly thanks to generative AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the user research lead, I know my team has had some wins and losses trying to navigate the shift. Through hard-earned lessons, I’ve found these to be the core principles at the heart of our best work during this unique moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Don’t be intimidated by the AI discourse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you became a researcher or designer because you never tire of trying to understand human behavior. It’s unlikely that what brought you to your field is that you were super duper excited about getting into the nitty gritty details of technology as it developed. Perhaps you’ve always been more or less content consulting with tech stakeholders as needed and thinking more about the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all well and good, but on a personal note, at some point in the AI journey at Lightricks, I realized my failure to engage with the technical aspects of integrating AI into our products was quickly becoming my most significant liability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I make product recommendations based on our research insights if I’m distancing myself from AI’s totally new set of product possibilities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can relate, it’s important to acknowledge that many of us have self-limiting beliefs that prevent us from engaging with technical discourse. For example, I’ve often said, “I work in tech, but I’m not techy.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is what I’ve learned to be true: Artificial intelligence is as much about possibility, innovation, and people as it is about complex data sets and code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more I read about generative AI as it relates to what we do at Lightricks, the more I find myself making better product recommendations and generating more relevant ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t need education; I just needed a new mindset. I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; wrap my head around this. The same goes for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you &lt;i&gt;decide&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; you can stay on top of AI as it relates to your product landscape, you’ll be giving user-informed guidance to your product team that fuels the innovation your company is undoubtedly going for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Build better relationships with technical stakeholders&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most UXRs and designers consult with developers and technical researchers regularly, the bulk of that type of product work is left to product managers in many organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: I quickly learned that &lt;i&gt;reading &lt;/i&gt;about AI developments was important, but it only got me so far.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, you have people on your tech team consuming all the available content, trying everything new, and forging an understanding of where AI is and where it’s going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On your end, you’re constantly gaining a new understanding of the needs and behaviors of your target audience. When you’re in regular conversation with tech stakeholders, the technical vision and the deep knowledge of user insights can really come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may require rethinking how and when you incorporate tech stakeholders into your flow. You’re off to a good start if you’re used to inviting tech leads when presenting research results. But maybe you want to consult with your dev or research team even when &lt;i&gt;planning&lt;/i&gt; a research project to check and see if the technical landscape lends itself to questions about users that you may not have thought of on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artificial intelligence boom requires a new level of tech and human understanding that is simultaneous and elegant. Building better relationships with technical stakeholders is a good way for UXRs to rise to the occasion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Never lose sight of the UXR vision: Understand and evangelize user needs and value props&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I mentioned shiny object syndrome: AI can do so many cool things. Some organizations struggle with being purposeful with what they integrate and why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people doing research, if we can avoid the syndrome and give fast, rigorous insights regarding user needs—we can be a guiding force in ensuring that product iterations are purposeful and give users real value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might this look like practically? It’s a combination of doing what we’ve always done—asking and answering the right questions about our users and avoiding the trap of only doing evaluative or usability-focused research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI allows your team to release new things fast and furiously, it’s easy to get into a way of working where you’re testing the flows with users, giving quick UX insights and recommendations, and then moving on to the next thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this type of research is important for the user experience, it’s crucial to stay on top of what’s happening even at the idea stage so you can do more exploratory and behavioral research to understand whether rapidly proposed solutions actually meet user needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has always been true about the role of UXR—but the unprecedented pace and unpredictable direction of AI make it easier to do quick, evaluative research and miss the opportunity to help product stakeholders prioritize what actually gives tangible value to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence poses challenges for user research, but if we adapt to what it asks of us, it’s an exciting time to be a part of designing unprecedented experiences. We can do that by engaging with the discourse, decreasing the distance between us and our technical teams, and never losing sight of our role in guiding product roadmaps toward meeting real user needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Designed to kill: the ethics of AI and warfare ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/ethics-ai-warfare</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/ethics-ai-warfare</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An AI-enabled drone goes rogue in a simulated mission to attack predetermined sites. Suddenly, as the simulation progresses, the drone stops following commands. When the human pilot gives a “no-go” order, the drone interprets this as interfering with its primary mission. The drone ignores orders and does the unexpected. It turns on the pilot—killing them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This event was initially believed to have happened in a U.S. Air Force (USAF) simulation. But after widespread concern, Col Tucker Hamilton, the Chief of AI Test and Operations, USAF, who shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aerosociety.com/news/highlights-from-the-raes-future-combat-air-space-capabilities-summit/#:~:text=He%20notes%20that,accomplishing%20its%20objective.%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;the story&lt;/a&gt;, had to clarify his comments. He now states the simulation never happened and was nothing more than a hypothesis. The question is—could this hypothesis come true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the idea of the rise of robots or an AI-led war was a tale from science fiction. Most will remember a chilling scene in Stanley Kubrick’s &lt;i&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; where HAL, a programmed computer, won’t let Dr. David Bowman—locked out of his spacecraft—back in. “I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that,” HAL famously says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the global acceleration of AI, these ideas don’t seem so far-fetched. Autonomous robots and weapons could be the next—potentially concerning—frontier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korea and the European Union are developing autonomous weapons—something that many believe is cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is an AI drone-led war a real possibility? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is impacting the world on a global scale. Goldman Sachs predicts that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.key4biz.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Global-Economics-Analyst_-The-Potentially-Large-Effects-of-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Economic-Growth-Briggs_Kodnani.pdf&quot;&gt;300 million jobs&lt;/a&gt; could be lost or degraded due to AI. While research from OpenAI shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdpinstitute.org/news/80-of-u-s-workers-will-be-affected-by-ai-openai-research/#:~:text=It&apos;s%20hard%20to%20believe%20ChatGPT,more%20of%20their%20tasks%20affected.&quot;&gt;generative AI will impact 80 percent of workers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As technological advances find their way into weaponry, so do concerns about their use. Autonomous weapons are independent of humans. They’re self-operating systems that attack places or people during warfare. In fully-autonomous scenarios, once activated, they require no further input from a human. That means human reasoning, empathy, and decision-making is lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ingvild Bode, Associate Professor of International Relations, Centre for War Studies, University of Southern Denmark, and Principal Investigator of project AutoNorms on weaponized AI, believes people should be concerned about the development of AI-integrated weapons.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, Dr. Bode highlighted loitering munitions—expendable aerial systems that use machine-based analysis to identify, track, and attack targets. While these systems are currently operated with human support, there is a threat that they will soon be operated with latent capability—that is—no human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she notes the current developments of AI weapon systems are unlikely to lead to an “AI-led war,” there’s still significant risk associated with such technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really want to highlight the short-term risks attached to current-level AI in weapon systems rather than the long-term risks associated with what is often referred to [as] existential threats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even integrating autonomous and AI technologies into targeting and military decision-making today has created significant uncertainties about the extent to which humans can remain in meaningful control over the use of force,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can we prevent an AI-led war? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rapid rise of AI technology, well-known experts are calling for fast action to avoid the potentially dangerous consequences of AI becoming too powerful too quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and 1000 AI experts have signed &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/&quot;&gt;Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter&lt;/a&gt; advocating for a halt in training AI more powerful than GPT-4 for six months—until we understand more about the technology. The reason? The “profound risks to society and humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the open letter, many doctors and health professionals joined the call to stop AI research and development without legislation. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/doctors-and-public-health-experts-join-calls-for-halt-to-ai-rd-until-its-regulated/&quot;&gt;BMJ Global Health journal&lt;/a&gt;, they claim that AI poses an “existential threat to humanity.” In the journal, the rise of autonomous weapons is one of the three main threats they highlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“LAWS [Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems] can be attached to small mobile devices, such as drones, and could be cheaply mass-produced and easily set up to kill “at an industrial scale,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the short-term risks seemingly very real, how can we globally prevent the potentially serious risks associated with AI weapons? Legislation may be the critical answer. But to drive legally binding rules—the people who work closely with AI must articulate and enforce ethical standards and constraints when building with this technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The critical need for socially responsible design &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the broader societal implications of design is more critical than ever in developing AI tools. It may be the biggest ethical challenge designers, researchers, and developers of our time will face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether AI is integrated into a weapon, all autonomous technologies should be developed with strict ethics in mind. Designing ethically means avoiding tools that would harm humans, the environment, or other living species.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than waiting for the powers that be to set out guidelines, one could argue that the onus lies with the people and organizations building such products. A culture of ethical leadership, decision-making, and an open dialog about ethical concerns ought to be integral for those people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As product practitioners working with AI, we are responsible for learning, discussing, assessing, and acting in ways consistent with socially responsible ethics—after all, as we produce: we may be changing the future for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Progress through public advocacy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, social progress happens when enough voices tip the balance. Take any social issue—the right for women to vote, the legalization of same-sex marriage, protection of the natural environment—and you’ll find public advocacy at the core of progressive changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines and best practices may not go far enough to limit organizations when financial and political rewards are at play. There may be greater possibilities to enforce socially responsible practices in AI and create rigid legislation if enough members of the public support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference comes down to us—the people, particularly those most familiar with the technology—and what we believe will ensure the safest and most positive future for ourselves and future generations. With enough voices, we can drive essential legislative change that will hold people and organizations accountable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regulating how AI is created and used &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislation is likely the most critical step to avoid both AI’s short- and long-term risks. Governments have a responsibility to regulate the use of AI to avoid fully autonomous weapons, among other potential risks, becoming a problematic reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman while &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-openai-ceo-sam-altman-congress-73ff96c6571f38ad5fd68b3072722790&quot;&gt;testifying before Congress&lt;/a&gt;, claimed regulators must set limits on AI systems. He said that AI could cause “significant harm to the world” and noted, “If this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts agree that international legally binding rules are also critical. Currently, the Council of Europe (CoE), an international human rights organization, is developing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1ebddf13-09de-43a0-88bb-1d420a9d31f2#:~:text=An%20international%20Convention%20on%20AI,binding%20international%20convention%20on%20AI.&quot;&gt;International Convention on AI&lt;/a&gt;. The convention aims to “agree that AI systems which pose unacceptable risks to individuals should be prohibited and that there should be minimum safeguards to protect individuals that may be affected by AI systems.” With 46 state members currently, this convention may take the form of a global treaty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Dr. Bode points out international regulations can be slow, and steps need to be taken now. She recommends on a national level that states create binding regulations to protect against dangers. She also believes states should be transparent about integrating AI into weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/u-s-state-legislative-bills-on-ai-a-mid-6921084/&quot;&gt;43 bills&lt;/a&gt; have been introduced to regulate AI development and deployment. To date, though, few of those bills have become legally binding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kwm.com/global/en/insights/latest-thinking/summary-of-ai-regulation-around-the-world.html&quot;&gt;Pending legislation&lt;/a&gt; exists in the EU, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kwm.com/global/en/insights/latest-thinking/summary-of-ai-regulation-around-the-world.html&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has enacted a degree of AI regulation. Many other countries are considering legislation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The development of responsible AI Principles &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing guiding ethical principles that individuals, corporations, and nations can refer to and align with is also critical. This may help guide nations as they legislate, provide requirements for organizations that develop AI, and be a reference point for individuals as they navigate the new technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia, for example, has created eight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-framework/australias-ai-ethics-principles&quot;&gt;Ethics Principles&lt;/a&gt; “to ensure AI is safe, secure, and reliable.” Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.responsibleaiindex.org/&quot;&gt;Global Index on Responsible AI&lt;/a&gt; is currently being developed to support the safe implementation of AI globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these principles are not legally binding, however, there’s no guarantee that nations will follow them. As Dr. Bode stated, “At the moment, there is a clear gap between the few principles that exist and their implementation. The statement that autonomous or AI technologies will be used in an accountable, governable, [and] responsible manner is important. But what will this look like exactly?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designers, researchers, and developers acting ethically, public advocacy, and legislation at the national and international levels are essential steps forward as this technology accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the words of Dr. Bode, “We should go beyond the ‘let’s wait and see approach’ if we want to avoid highly problematic consequences.” &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Regrettably, as a researcher, I didn't explore the human experience; instead, I exploited it]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/regrettably-as-a-researcher</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/regrettably-as-a-researcher</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;01 My cat and users&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My cat Toto has been staying with me for three years. When he meows at me, I meow back. Then he blinks. I have no idea what his meowing means. Still, we seem to understand each other to some extent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a period of time after he came to my house, I knew that if I sat in my office chair and was about to finish a one-hour meeting, he would walk towards me, jump on my shoulder, sit down, and rest. Not 30-minute meetings, not one-and-half-hour meetings, only one hour. Most of the time, I predicted right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many other examples like this one. I don’t speak cat, but I understand Toto’s preferences and habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, I have talked to hundreds of users, if not thousands, for different companies in my career, but I barely know them as much as I know my cat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I don’t even know if they really “exist.” I see Toto every single day, and I’m involved in the same being-in-the-world with him. Those users, however, were all represented as words and statistics in my research reports. Ultimately, through user research, I turned them into one-dimensional materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it reasonable? Is it prudent I remain unaware of the inner workings of those real, living people I encounter over  Zoom, who each quarter produce millions of dollars for the company, and I know so much about my cat, yet he produces only poop? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;02 Exploration and exploitation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I still know something about those users. I know how they use the product when I talk to them during an interview. Within my business scope and product strategy, I know them through asking what they want, what they think, what they did, what they suffer from, and what they expect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most design/UX research activities, the real people are “being users and customers” because they are only allowed to talk about experience within a certain business context or regarding a product concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not experience exploration. This is sentiment exploitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment exploitation occurs when a researcher introduces participants to a context deliberately established around a product idea or business proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ask them to express opinions and discuss past experiences to answer indirect, product-oriented questions. At the end of the day, the research subjects were partially discovered and constantly exploited in service of product development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s exploration? There are many forms and methods that lend themselves to exploration. Ethnography is one. Zeitlyn (2022) said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/ZeitlynAnthropological&quot;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;An Anthropological Toolkit: Sixty Useful Concepts&lt;/i&gt;, and I quote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It illustrates the sort of excursions on which ethnographic research can take us: meandering journeys, following where the data lead us, and sometimes involving unexpected and fruitful deviations (Just and Zeitlyn, 2014). This approach contrasts starkly with the strictly predetermined routes of (now sometimes pre-registered) hypothesis-driven data gathering.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have come to realize why I can comprehend Toto’s needs and expectations so well, despite the absence of a shared language and the interspecies barrier. It was because I explored his living context instead of trying to take advantage of it for profit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adopting a non-utilitarian and non-opportunistic approach, I involved myself within the same spatial and temporal context as Toto. As a result, my cat presents himself to me within this shared context, fostering a deeper connection and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that I’m not saying the cat intentionally shows himself to me like a human. Animals are not able to think or behave that way. Toto was presented to me as an object. This “being presented” is a mutual relationship between the object and my intentionality in reaching out to the object. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/&quot;&gt;Hussurl’s phenomenology&lt;/a&gt;, while understanding Toto, I’m in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualityresearchinternational.com/socialresearch/epoche.htm#:~:text=Epoch%C3%A9%20is%20the%20process%20of,essential%20nature%20of%20the%20world.&quot;&gt;epoché procedure&lt;/a&gt; where I suspend and bracket my assumptions towards him. I prioritized my in-person experiences to engage and immerse myself in the act of feeling rather than approaching my cat with a predetermined purpose or hypothesis aimed at seeking specific answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;03 Talking to users is not enough for exploration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In design research, many factors can impede exploration, but listening to people tell their stories and fitting the responses into a product-based assumption is one of the most detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers should find opportunities to engage in the same spatial and temporal context as their research subjects. If I sit in the office or the other side of the Zoom link, listening to people recounting their past stories, I’m taken away from the sensory aspects of shared experience. But it is exactly within these immersive environments that I can truly empathize and gain a deeper understanding of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that what people say is different from what they do. But even knowing what they do is not enough because we don’t know what makes them do what they do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, what is it that makes people do what they do? It’s the vast, invisible structure of context that consists of cultural norms, organizational power structures, economic status, government policies, religions, fashion trends, education systems, arts, media, technologies, and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still arguable whether humans have free will, either scientifically or philosophically. But my point is that people’s experiences and actions are inherently intertwined with and inseparable from the structure of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain oblivious to the contextual structure that has influenced and shaped us in a particular manner as we lack an external perspective beyond our own experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher, I am responsible for delving into and elucidating the connection between the research subjects and the underlying structure that shapes their identities and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at this image. How does the heart appear to you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the heart show itself, or does the darker background define the heart? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe both. Without the background context, the heart disappears. The heart and the background exist in a harmonious relationship that transcends duality. The interplay between the heart and its background contributes to our perception and understanding of its presence and characteristics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing solely on what research subjects explicitly communicate can be unreliable, as people may withhold information or provide inaccurate responses. Verbal communication, in the context of research, can be limited and shortsighted, as it often captures only a fraction of the broader context and nuances of individuals’ experiences and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about the instances in which the original experience undergoes filtering and distortion through verbal communication. For example, from the moment a person makes a purchase in a specific store at a particular time to the point where they are later invited to participate in research and recount the experience. How far am I from the person’s initial experience? I must consider the extent to which the initial experience has been influenced by the process of recalling and retelling, potentially introducing biases along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have an inherent ability to craft intricate narratives, sometimes unknowingly veering into the realm of deception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While verbal communication proves valuable in assessing solutions and generating design concepts, it falls short when it comes to pathfinding and long-term innovation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A holistic understanding of our customers requires delving deeper and seeking alternative sources of information like images, videos, signs, texts, sounds, and so on to gain a more comprehensive perspective on what makes people who they are, what they do, and what they truly desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;04 People on paper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration means approaching things as they are presented, free from preconceived biases or assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I research to help design and product teams make quick decisions, which is important. However, I also need to set aside the constructed images of customers portrayed in business models, journey maps, personas, roadmaps, and opportunity-solution trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are simplified representations created for the convenience of companies. I employ these images to help everyone in the company understand our customers, but it’s crucial to recognize how they oversimplify the complexity of real individuals. It’s somewhat of a shortcut to make things easier and faster than they truly are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should explore what makes people who they are through a structuralist perspective to recognize societal structures, a symbolic interactionist’s lens to uncover social meanings, a Foucauldian discourse analysis to delve into power and discipline, or a semiotic methodology to uncover the relations among signs and meanings that unconsciously shape behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of theoretical lenses to explore humans. Product lens is only one of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why should I learn who people are if they’re not “being my users?” Because by viewing research subjects through this narrow lens, it becomes challenging to break through the confines of the existing product or business model. To open up new possibilities for innovation and growth, it is essential that I broaden my understanding of my users. That’s what exploratory research should aim for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;05 AI and my cat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working as a design researcher for years. It’s regrettable that most of the time, it was utilitarian. I considered natural and contextual humans as one-dimensional users attached to my company’s product. They didn’t have a chance to present their own values to me in the world they live in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expected foundational research aimed at futuristic innovation, such as Intel’s long-term studies on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/technology/intels-sharp-eyed-social-scientist.html&quot;&gt;daily technology usage&lt;/a&gt;, would increase the appetite for contextual exploration. I thought Intel’s aspiration to be regarded as more than just a chip maker would inspire many companies to see things from an alternative perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly, AI will likely be able to discover the “known unknown” better and faster than me. It won’t be surprising if it displaces hundreds of thousands of designers’ and researchers’ day-to-day research duties—from writing discussion guides to interviewing users, testing prototypes, and writing reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the key to mitigating the conflict between human intelligence and artificial intelligence lies in comprehending the intricate and multifaceted human context to uncover unforeseen possibilities that can invigorate businesses. Unfortunately, most organizations haven’t produced such a vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m looking at my cat again. The breeder delivered him to me three years ago. Maybe I’m wrong. After all, he was exploited by my desire to own a cat. That was already a bias through which I approached him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he lives a happy life at the moment. I didn’t ask what he would change in my house if he had a magic wand. Nor have I measured the success rate of his jumping off the cat tree and landing on my couch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picked him up at the airport and brought him into my house. In fact, it was me who walked into his world with no purposeful plans. In this shared world, he was presented to me. In this shared world, what he likes and dislikes was elicited in an unspoken manner. I’ve never asked, but I’ve explored and understood a lot. AI doesn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;References &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeitlyn, D. (2014). &lt;i&gt;Excursions in realist anthropology: a merological approach&lt;/i&gt;.

Take a person’s weight in kilograms, divide it by the square of their height in meters, and you have their BMI. My BMI, for example, is 26.5, placing me in the “overweight” class. Some of my fellow women might be surprised by that, given my dress size is an Australian 10 to 12 (an American 6 to 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lift weights about twice a week. Muscle weighs more than fat, so if I ever start getting to competition level, I’ll probably move up a class—into obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most designers have a certain degree of suspicion when it comes to anything “data-driven” or even “data-led.” It can be difficult to articulate, especially in tech-oriented organizations that value measurable outcomes. In such cultures, a collection of findings from qualitative research, however robust, can’t compete against the reassuring objectivity of quantitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean the suspicion is unfounded. A culture that values data is just that—a culture. And all cultures have histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All technologies have histories, too, including those used in data collection. Many of the first units of measurement were based on human bodies. A cubit was the length of a forearm, a span was the distance between thumb-tip and little finger, and a foot speaks for itself. Collecting measurement data &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; human bodies, on the other hand, requires a different kind of tool: standardized measurement. The lengths of feet can differ, the length of “a foot” cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measurement systems are hard to shift, and we often need seismic cultural events to make the change. The metric system, for example, is a direct result of the French Revolution. In 1790, the French National Assembly commissioned the creation of a universal, rational set of constants, and the metric system is the result. 

A meter, they decided, is one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator, and a kilogram is the weight of one liter of water at freezing point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing base ten measurements allowed all sorts of previously impossible calculations, especially in statistics. One enthusiast was Belgian mathematician, astronomer, criminologist, and statistician Adolphe Quetelet, who, in 1832, came up with “the Quetelet Index”—the exact same height-to-weight ratio that we call the BMI today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like his intellectual forebears in the French Revolution, Quetelet believed that rational, mathematical methods could make sense of the messiness of human life. Math had already done a great deal to find almost magical solutions to complex problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Gauss, for example, proved that the probability of events could be drawn on a “normal curve.” In mathematics, a normal curve is any distribution of data that shows symmetry around the average value. If a hundred people all flip a coin a hundred times, a few will flip mostly heads, a similar number will flip mostly tails, but the majority will flip a more-or-less equal number of heads and tails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events closer to the center of the curve are more representative of the true nature of the thing being measured, and those further away are less so. Gauss’ probability curve is easy to recognize: today, we call it “the bell curve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine Quetelet’s surprise when he discovered that his metric measurements of people’s weights and heights fit perfectly with Gauss’ bell curve. The conclusion seemed obvious: if the center of Gauss’ probability curve represented something’s most accurate form, then the center of Quetelet’s curve represented the perfect person. More than that, the further away from the center a person’s measurement was, the less perfect they must be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the average man were completely determined, we might, as I have already observed, consider him a type of perfection: and everything differing from his proportions or condition, would constitute deformity and disease.”—Adolphe Quetelet,&lt;i&gt; A treatise on man and the development of his faculties.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emboldened by his success, Quetelet searched for—and found—bell curves in many aspects of the human state. He collected data for identifying the perfect face, intelligence, character. Unsurprisingly, his work would later be foundational to the rise of eugenics and so-called scientific racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not until the 1970s that Quetelet’s Index made its way into health care. Ancel Keys, an American physiologist and dietician, conducted a study that showed the Index—which he renamed “Body Mass Index”—was a good way to screen people for obesity quickly. Good if you were a man, at least: while Keys’ research cohort included men from Finland, Italy, Japan, America, and Bantu men from South Africa, it contained no women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, it contained no one from the 50 percent of the human population who have proportionately higher body fat than the half that was measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his part, Quetelet would have been shocked by this outcome. His purpose was to find patterns and solve problems at the population scale, not at the level of individual people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would have been less shocked at the exclusion of women, as his own measurements for the original Index were all on French and Scottish soldiers—all of whom, at that time, were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BMI has many downsides for people at all levels of health. It has a lot of upsides, however, for doctors. Health decisions can be made easily with only a scale based on kilograms, a tape measure based on centimeters, and a quick calculation. Based on a person’s BMI, eligibility criteria for certain medicines are met or not met, fitness for some surgeries approved or not approved, access to health services granted or denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My “overweight” classification puts me in good company: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/overweight-obesity/overweight-and-obesity/contents/summary&quot;&gt;about 67 percent of Australians are overweight or obese&lt;/a&gt; according to their BMI score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 67 percent is an objective, reliable fact. What it isn’t is a fact with objective, reliable foundations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only instance of a metric providing information that isn’t fit for purpose. Still, for those of us who do human-centered work, especially in tech-oriented organizational cultures, it’s evidence that our suspicions are, at least sometimes, correct.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is UX research a vanity metric? ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/ux-research-vanity-metric</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/ux-research-vanity-metric</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vanity metrics look and sound nice to others but don’t help an organization improve meaningfully. John Cutler &lt;a href=&quot;https://amplitude.com/blog/vanity-metrics&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “Vanity metrics make us feel good but don’t help us do better work or make better decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanity metrics can pop up when measuring certain parts of the user or customer experience. Let’s take product metrics as an example: We might get excited about high numbers if we measure early feature adoption as a new feature is released. But what if those numbers drop off steeply after customers try the feature and don’t like it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words: &lt;i&gt;Using&lt;/i&gt; isn’t the same as &lt;i&gt;trying out&lt;/i&gt;. The metric doesn’t reflect the context in which we measure it, so its use becomes incorrectly meaningful or even meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example: If we measure the (growing) number of researchers a company hires, we might feel hopeful about the practice as the numbers increase. But what if the company disregards the insights they produce, continuing with business as usual?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s strange to argue that the presence of an organizational function, in other words, actual humans with particular expertise, might be a vanity metric. But it’s one explanation for the challenges facing the UX research discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I raised this question in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janelleward1_uxresearch-organizationalculture-hiring-activity-7077177209995579392-yuZx&quot;&gt;recent LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt;, mentioning several points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LinkedIn community has spoken and raised several perspectives on this topic. Let’s run through a synthesis of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief: some agreed, some disagreed, and others raised indirectly relevant issues that reflect the current state of UX research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Influence is tough without access&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question struck a chord because researchers, and those who support them, often experience a disparity between their aspirations and how the organization perceives them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikkianderson-ux/&quot;&gt;Nikki Anderson-Stanier&lt;/a&gt; said, “I’ve seen in quite a few circumstances where we are a check box [sic] to show that the org is ‘user-centric,’ but hopefully, we continue to move away from that sentiment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this perspective, researchers are hired to showcase specific values that the organization does not necessarily act upon. Essentially, it becomes a form of UX theater. Having researchers on board is encouraging and shows a financial investment in the field, but mere presence might not be sufficient to make researchers feel genuinely appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rumenrachev/&quot;&gt;Rumen Rachev&lt;/a&gt; approached this perspective from a slightly different angle. Starting from the question, “Are UX researchers hired to solve a problem?” He wrote that if researchers point out too many problems, “...in the end, you become the problem itself… ‘Just deliver’—is what most employees are brought on board [to do].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly tough for researchers. Simultaneously, we are encouraged to create actionable insights that impact our stakeholders’ decision-making process, as well as continue to advocate for our practice through sometimes impossible circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumen is right—if we uncover too many problems, we can become the problem. But let’s take a step back—what is the problem we are hired to solve in the first place? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do we agree on the problem UXRs are hired to solve?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahroseknowles/&quot;&gt;Hannah Knowles&lt;/a&gt; rejected the idea that UX research is a vanity metric, pointing out that “you wouldn’t hire a detective if you didn’t need one.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the perspective: Employees are hired to solve a problem. But what problem are they solving? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterbalazspolgar/&quot;&gt;Péter Balázs Polgár&lt;/a&gt;, “Maybe the issue is that there is no common understanding of what the problem is.” He pointed to hiring junior to mid-level researchers to focus on craft rather than organizational issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Péter continues, “I guess the elephant in the room is that leaders (often even design leaders, as UX research is frequently attached to design) might also not be able to articulate what are their expectations—that’s why they bring researchers on the [sic] board, expecting them to be able to tell what the problem is in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food for thought, certainly—it’s one thing if the broader organization isn’t sure what problem researchers are there to solve. But if UX leadership doesn’t know the problem, in what position does that place researchers? We’ll come back to this in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yes and no—and where does the responsibility lie? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX research can be a vanity metric—and it can also not be one. Giving us the UX design perspective, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinisasso/&quot;&gt;Vinicius Sasso&lt;/a&gt; wrote, “...it seems UX (the broad discipline and domain) is disliked by many companies because most of it is problem-finding.” He went on to say that research can be both—it depends on the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmspool/&quot;&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt; asked why we were having this discussion in the first place. Rather than point to researchers or organizations as a whole, he echos Péter and, even more directly, places the responsibility in the hands of UX leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says: “This is not a failure of UX researchers or the companies that hire them. This is a failure due to a lack of UX leaders who know how to successfully lead strategic UX research. As long as UX research is primarily reactive tactical work, it will be undervalued and brought in late. It will only be seen as validation work, not as innovation-generating. We need to focus on the UX leadership problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I asked for details, Jared dived deeper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“...hiring the wrong person for a job is an issue, but I don’t think we can blame companies completely for that. What guidance does our field give inexperienced-with-UX hiring managers on how to hire their first UX leader? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feels to me like a systemic issue, and we own the responsibility for this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vanity metric is a metric that looks and sounds good to others but doesn’t help an organization improve in any meaningful way. So, is UX research a vanity metric? Does a research team of ten mean an organization is dedicated to integrating the user perspective in decision-making, or do they just want to appear that way? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in the organization’s particular circumstances, but it also lies in the perception of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s true, it’s disheartening. If you’re a practicing researcher or an advocate of research and this discussion leaves you feeling discouraged, just remember: This experience is part of learning about how the field operates. Every profession thrives in some environments and struggles in others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as researchers, we know exploring the problem space is a necessary step to finding a solution. Let’s keep it up. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why we need to redesign food]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/why-we-need-to-redesign-food</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/why-we-need-to-redesign-food</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Feel like a fraud? Why imposter syndrome is a problem for product people]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/feel-like-a-fraud-why-imposter-syndrome-is-a-problem-for-product-people</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/feel-like-a-fraud-why-imposter-syndrome-is-a-problem-for-product-people</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/the-dubious-rise-of-impostor-syndrome&quot;&gt;This piece&lt;/a&gt; ran in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; earlier this year. Authored by Leslie Jamison, it questioned whether the term &lt;i&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/i&gt; was helpful—and whether the experience was even a syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most intriguing part of the article was that whatever you call it, the fear of being exposed as inadequate isn’t vague self-doubt that we have to push through with the help of inspirational quotes and friends who tell us we’re &lt;i&gt;killing it&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, it’s a complex emotional experience involving your inner world, the people, and the systems around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a user research lead, this made me reflect on my experience transitioning to product from product marketing and conversations with colleagues about their feelings of imposterdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, I’ve come to look at all of our experiences working on a product team in the tech industry and found a few ways to limit the feeling of “faking it” when doing product work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What contributes to feelings of imposterdom on a product team?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first myth Jamison dispelled is that imposter syndrome is a &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;problem. Let’s take a look at some of the factors contributing to your feelings that you’re a fake beyond your level of self-confidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our feelings of competency are often at the mercy of organizational culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a member of your management team admit they made a mistake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does your company or organization have a system for postmortems, where everyone is accountable for how they executed something? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mistake is made or a project fails, is the focus on who to blame or what you and your colleagues can do better next time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions might give you a big clue as to why you’ve been feeling like an imposter lately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of feelings of inadequacy is &lt;i&gt;fear.&lt;/i&gt; Mistakes are rungs on the ladder of learning and improving as a product professional. When your organization or management team treats mistakes as grounds for being blamed, dismissed, or worse, it engenders a systemic fear of failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear that failure could result in your downfall leads you to scrutinize your abilities more than if you were in a psychologically safe environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environments like this make it more likely that you’ll find “holes” in your professional competency—and give rise to an internal dialogue that lends itself to feeling like an imposter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The nature of product work leaves a lot of room for self-doubt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, product development is taking everything from management input, industry knowledge, quantitative and qualitative data points, and intuition—to churn out value for your users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a product manager, researcher, or designer, your work involves a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; high degree of trust in your judgment while knowing that reckoning will come in the form of definitive KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often on product teams, specific people champion particular ideas based on their interpretation of the available information. They initiate product iterations and projects that often use a lot of internal resources, and it’s only &lt;i&gt;after &lt;/i&gt;the expense of dev, design, data, and marketing resources that they know whether they succeeded in affecting key metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the nature of &lt;i&gt;product work&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;trusting yourself and convincing others to trust you without any way of verifying that you’re right.&lt;/i&gt; You have to convince yourself that you have a good product solution to a user need &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; be confident enough in what you’re saying to bring others along with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time between advocating for a product iteration and knowing the answer can be long, depending on the complexity. It’s not like, say, if you were a bank teller and you estimate a few crunched numbers in your head, check with a calculator, and correct a mistake a few seconds later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a long period where other people are working toward your &lt;i&gt;unproven belief&lt;/i&gt;. It’s not so surprising that we start to doubt ourselves throughout this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People around you may be second-guessing your ideas, and you may be as well. You spend most of your days in a state of not knowing. There’s plenty of time to start wondering if you actually have no idea what you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If you’re a member of an underrepresented community, you’re more likely to feel like an imposter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the tech industry has made some serious strides in the past decade or two, many of us are underrepresented in our companies and the industry at large. When you look around and see that, in some way, you’re different from your colleagues, it creates a prime breeding ground for imposter syndrome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that a diversity problem at a particular organization or within the tech industry is completely unrelated to our own professional capabilities, the experience of being underrepresented lends itself to a subconscious self-doubt imposed on us by our environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what can product professionals do to limit the feelings that we’re faking it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know imposter syndrome isn’t a simple case of self-doubt we can talk ourselves out of. How our work &lt;i&gt;works, &lt;/i&gt;who we work alongside, and our organizational culture create a system that can make it extremely difficult to shed feelings of being exposed as an imposter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things I’ve found helpful to quell imposter syndrome for you to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product development is all about investing resources before you get results, leading initiatives based on your interpretations of data and intuition. There’s simply no way that you’re the only one on the product team battling feelings that they’re not cut out for their role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful antidotes to feeling like an imposter is knowing that it’s a normal human experience and that most of your team struggles with it, too. In other words, that nagging feeling of being a fake is a hazard of the job and does not reflect a personal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that feeling like an imposter isn’t self-doubt that you can strongarm into submission. It’s a complex set of emotions that come from our self-perception, the nature of our work, and the surrounding culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that knowledge, you can approach your own feelings of fakeness and fear of being exposed in a more nuanced way and, ultimately, achieve freedom from it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research is part of design—this is how you make time for it]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-design</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-design</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a user research lead, I’ve worked closely with designers for quite some time. I’m familiar with the tension between honoring the creative process and meeting tight deadlines in fast-moving business environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designers I’ve worked with have lamented their lack of time to invest in the research and discovery phase of the design process, hounded by the need to produce, produce, produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they’re lucky, their organization has invested in full-time researchers—but if not, research is often done infrequently or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deep dive into the details of what you, my designer friends, are leaving on the table by not doing UXR—and explore some ways to incorporate research into your process, even when the clock is always ticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s left on the table when you don’t make time for UXR in the design process?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m here with an agenda: I want you to wake up tomorrow morning and be totally fired up about incorporating UXR in your design process, no matter how much time pressure you’re under. Before we address &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to do that, let’s review what you’re missing out on if you &lt;i&gt;don’t&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A (non-exhaustive) list of what happens when UXR is excluded from design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, user voice promotes the creativity you need to create extraordinary user experiences and decreases the time between now and when you hit your team’s KPIs—even if you occasionally have to extend some deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why fly blind? Why waste time? I know: you’re doing it because you aren’t sure how you and your team could possibly squeeze out any extra time and space for UXR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three ways to buy time for user research in the design process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use these strategies and tips to ensure UXR becomes entrenched in your design practice—the results will speak for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Evangelize the tangible ROI of UXR to your fellow designers and management &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how you do this depends on your organizational culture, but my recommendation is to start by creating a short presentation that includes the main value propositions of UXR in product design (you can take them directly from the previous section). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to &lt;i&gt;include examples of past work that would have benefitted from user research&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, you can show a feature that took a few releases to hit a main KPI due to UX fumbles and explain how usability testing with 10 to 15 users over a few days could have alerted you to most of these issues even before the first release.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps your team worked on a much-anticipated feature or initiative that users didn’t use or pay for. Point it out in your presentation and explain that UXR methodology can enable you to develop very educated hypotheses around whether you’re solving real and important user problems &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; your organization invests too much in design, development, and marketing resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you’re short, to the point, and laser-focused on reaching business goals faster by getting less wrong in the first place. Though UXR &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;a part of honoring the creative process, it’s not likely that management will be as motivated by this fact as you are (though your fellow designers may be, so you can mention it to them!). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your presentation and conversation should end with a specific ask. From your fellow designers, you may want them to each speak with their direct managers about the importance of making this a priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From management, perhaps you want product leadership to include extra time in product development timelines for generative ideation research before large initiatives and a few extra days for usability testing pre-release. Think about what makes sense for your organization and your internal processes. After you’ve made your case, make the ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Start &lt;i&gt;today &lt;/i&gt;with the user voice information that you have from other teams&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you’re advocating for the inclusion of UXR in the design process, start building systems for using the information you already have from users internally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, many of you work at companies with customer support, sales, or account management teams. Meet with the relevant stakeholders to learn where and how they record user feedback so that you can figure out what’s relevant to you and utilize it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your organization has product marketing managers or social media managers, they’re also often an excellent source for user feedback—both on your product and the space you’re in generally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PMMs often know what your competitors are up to, and social media managers may know what your target audience is really struggling with based on what they’re venting about on social. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set some meetings, inform yourself, and figure out how to keep yourself and other designers informed on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Get all of the designers together to slice and dice time and effort for research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, your evangelizing will make an impression on management, and UXR will be a regular and official part of your internal design processes. Here’s the thing: you don’t have to sit around and wait for that to happen if you pool resources from your whole design team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a group of designers together and divvy things up. It’s unlikely that any one designer has a full day a week they can devote to research if it isn’t already part of your design culture—but most motivated designers can find an hour or two per week to get started.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe one designer will commit to meeting once weekly with the support team, and another will have a bi-weekly sync with the relevant marketing people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another designer who’s experienced with usability testing can research usability platforms and get quotes to approach management with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few designers may want to do weekly usability sessions with users on Zoom for key projects. Someone else could do one-to-two exploratory user interviews each week on topics related to key initiatives that aren’t being designed yet, looking at things like user pain points, motivations, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are examples, but the point is that if most of your designers give just a &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; bit of time, you can start getting significant user input even before management helps you reorganize internal processes to make room for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What if you don’t have basic user research skills?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news: if you’re a designer, while you may need to hone specific skills, you’re already ahead of the game because you’re engaging in design thinking every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, UXR is a function of design thinking. You’re in the habit of uncovering problems and opportunities, designing solutions, testing, and repeating—and that will serve you well as you plunge headfirst into user research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Consider taking a course&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple search will yield a ton of credible courses from design institutions you trust—use your organization’s professional development budget. Consider looking for more tactical rather than theoretical courses that will have you hitting the ground running sooner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of course topics that may be helpful:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/qualitative-research-skills/&quot;&gt;How to conduct user interviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/diving-into-research-design/&quot;&gt;How to write a research plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/unmoderated-user-testing/&quot;&gt;How to conduct a usability test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/what-is-grounded-theory-qualitative-research/&quot;&gt;How to analyze qualitative data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a specific course budget, you’ll be shocked at how much you can find for free. Just make sure you look at who created a specific video or article and that they have the necessary expertise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Read a book&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, only one book out there will qualify you to start dipping your toes in user research immediately after reading it—&lt;a href=&quot;https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Enough Research&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Erika Hall. She covers which methods to use, when, and a range of best practices for each. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get a mentor or do a skills exchange&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a full-time user researcher in your network is willing to mentor you or teach you some research skills in exchange for some Figma lessons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get creative with the people you’re connected to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the design community has total awareness of why they need real user insights to do their best work—but many individual designers feel forced to put it on hold due to organizational pacing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main message is: don’t settle. Doing your best design work, without a doubt, means committing to making some level of UXR a part of your process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The transformation of a legacy automaker: first 90 days]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-transformation-of-a-legacy-automaker-first-90-days</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-transformation-of-a-legacy-automaker-first-90-days</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hello, friends! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made it to the final part of our three-part series about establishing a UX Research discipline within a transforming company. (If you need to catch up, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/outlier/30-days-in/&quot;&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/outlier/60-days-in/&quot;&gt;Part two&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, our product team is responsible for creating a more seamless, interconnected experience for our auto manufacturer’s car buyers and owners. Instead of relying on multiple agency partners, we’re standing up an in-house team of product managers, UXers, portfolio management, analytics &amp;amp; experimentation—all that fun stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m the sole resource for all things UX Research, and I have been in the role for 90 days now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are my two goals for our budding UX Research department:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devote time to provide UX Research insights throughout the product life cycle, not just when it’s time to test prototypes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educate the product organization as a whole about when they might need UX Research, because I simply can’t be everywhere at once&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 60-day mark, I hadn’t really felt like I was making much progress on the first goal of &lt;b&gt;providing UX Research insights throughout the product life cycle&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m proud to say that as of the 90-day point, I’ve got &lt;b&gt;seven completed projects&lt;/b&gt; under my belt: only one of which was a user test of a prototype. The other projects have been focused on what to label new features/site areas, card sorts, and evaluations of live site experiences preceding redesigns—far more proactive than reactive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My backlog of product requests is twice as long, and I know this because I’ve got my &lt;b&gt;project management board&lt;/b&gt; set up! With some portfolio management support, it’s now the place where I drop requests, notes, links, and files related to each request. I’ve used the board to showcase what I’m working on to my boss (and the broader team, if they’re interested), plus I’ve flagged some items that fall more into the realm of content strategy (can’t &lt;i&gt;wait &lt;/i&gt;til that role fills).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite requests so far has been to &lt;b&gt;investigate a live pilot&lt;/b&gt; that’s having trouble taking off. I get to partner with our product strategy team to uncover hypotheses about the pilot’s performance and ultimately determine what lines of inquiry need to be pursued to make the product better in the future. Obviously, it would’ve been nice to sort out any major UX issues before launching, but the team was operating without a research resource at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the progress, &lt;b&gt;looming deadlines are starting to arise&lt;/b&gt; and prevent the incorporation of research as consistently as the UX team would like. Some stakeholders balk at the idea of letting a whole sprint go by while their designer digs into research findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the pressure, but I’ve also emphasized that sometimes research can (and should) happen in the background to be revisited once the initial designs have been passed along to development. I’ve reminded designers about the range of test types that can address their concerns quickly (think click tests or single-task sessions that take users literally moments). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, I’ve come to terms with the fact that a lot of initiatives tied to my first goal are “late bloomers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I’d like to set up a regular cadence of &lt;b&gt;customer listening sessions&lt;/b&gt;—an hour every two-to-three weeks where team members are able to observe a live customer interview, with potential to share their screens and perform a few tasks as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of challenges that could make the initiative fall flat: technical issues, no-shows, and difficulty moderating and cataloging the findings afterward. The idea of a single person managing all of that, on top of juggling other research projects, is daunting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I could probably lean on a colleague in another discipline (design or strategy, most likely), I’ve decided to wait until we have a second researcher on the team. That way the whole thing doesn’t come to a halt if I’m out sick or I’m passionate enough about creating opportunities for listening and empathy that I want to ensure quality over speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other long-term play for our team is going to be &lt;b&gt;benchmarking&lt;/b&gt;. It’s been up in the air whether our strategy team should own it or UXR. Personally, benchmarking has always felt like a lot of effort for minimal impact, but it’s requested by leadership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it probably can scale up to complement strategy’s goals over time, I’ve agreed to start a lightweight benchmarking initiative (executed by an external vendor, not our team). In a year, if we want to prove we’re providing a better experience, we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to have that initial baseline data in place. Right now, that feels like my latest bloomer of all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On to my second goal: Educate the product organization as a whole about when they might need UX Research, because I simply can’t be everywhere at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve continued &lt;b&gt;sharing out a research artifact each week&lt;/b&gt; in our team channel. It might be a link to a video, a data graph, a quote, or a full deck. No one’s expressed anything negative about these posts and apathetic team members may ignore them, but the team members who &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; research junkies love them. It’s a consistent opportunity to educate the team about how UXR supports them (plus what users are telling us).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product leaders and our org leader (my boss’s boss) have dropped into &lt;b&gt;UXR office hours&lt;/b&gt; to chat or provide heads up on future lines of inquiry. We’ve brainstormed research ideas on the fly, and I’ve used it as a chance to introduce new team members to our materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I alternate early mornings one week to accommodate UK folks and afternoons the next week for my west coast teammates. And of course, I don’t know if this helps, but I always remind the team via chat when office hours start and drop the link in for easy access. It’s only been two months, but I haven’t had an empty office hour yet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I’ve been neglecting my goals to assemble more training content for team members and broader stakeholder groups. It can be difficult to create materials with no audience requesting them or a clear deadline to deliver them. However, I’ve made it clear that I’m happy to spend one-on-one time with anyone who has questions, and that’s led to introductions across the team as well as the entire company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, this spirit of collaboration and support has inspired a new, third goal that is probably a no-brainer but deserves to be articulated: &lt;b&gt;build and maintain healthy cross-functional relationships&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before that the team is small, but growing. This means I’m &lt;b&gt;interviewing candidates for hire&lt;/b&gt;—sometimes several a week. While it’s been nice to get to know the candidates, it’s also given me and the other Ford-side interviewees opportunities to connect with each other in a different setting. Through our back chats, their questions, and our post-interview follow ups, I’m learning more about what they look for, their concerns, and their ultimate hopes for our team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The less-fun part of being on a growing team is that &lt;b&gt;there’s a lot of change, and it usually hits fast&lt;/b&gt;. Multiple times now, our designers have had to shift from supporting one product branch to another. There have been “fire drills” and early-morning/end-of-day sync calls arranged last minute. Our entire team is about to undergo an org change and roll up to a different executive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been lots of questions. Second-guessing. Stress. As a lead on the team, I’ve made a point of checking in on people’s well-being. I’ve made sure people take sick time when they feel crummy and helped others talk through their hesitations about a design direction. I’ve reminded people of their own expertise and assured them that everything will be fine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s not just feedback I’m handing out—it’s made its way back to me on multiple occasions. When I fall behind, my coworkers respond with grace and don’t mind moving a meeting or a deadline. If I’m not feeling well, I’m encouraged to shut down the computer for the day. I’m encouraged to speak up when my “spidey senses” are tingling. I tell a coworker they’re kicking ass and another one reassures me of the same thing a few days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to mention one more thing I’ve done to ensure healthy working relationships, and it might sound a little odd at first: &lt;b&gt;I shared my quarterly goals with the UX team&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought of quarterly goals as very personal, but I’ve also worked within teams where the “mission” wasn’t clear. That sucked. I’ve found out too late that my work has overlap with someone else’s, or I discovered I was working at cross-purposes against someone else’s vision for a project. Given how nebulous things are (and will likely continue to be for a while), I thought it best to be transparent with my immediate coworkers about my ambitions and plans for contributing to the company’s success, the team’s contributions, and my own personal growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more growing to do in the coming years. I’m looking forward to returning to these posts someday and seeing what I’ve learned since I first began this journey. I hope I’ve planted an idea or two in your own mind, and that it’s able to take root in your own work. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The art of creating insights that connect ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-art-of-creating-insights-that-connect</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-art-of-creating-insights-that-connect</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I started my journey as a user researcher, I was so overwhelmed by perfecting my core research skills, I couldn’t see my biggest hurdle. Here&amp;#39;s the thing—you can hone your research skills if you’re determined—it’s within your control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; hurdle that researchers struggle with the most is creating insights that land with stakeholders enough to have real impact.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, this is difficult because product decisions are often made by someone else. Your locus of control is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean that you can “do your best” and “see how it goes.”’ Over the past couple of years, I’ve learned just how much a researcher can do to create, present, and advocate for insights so they have a much better shot at influencing product decisions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritize the work that matters most to your product team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is a no-brainer. Of course, you don’t want to choose research projects that your product team doesn’t care about. Getting this exactly right, though, depends a lot on nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it could be that you have two potential projects in the pipeline, both of which were requested by the product team themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explores potential UX issues for a flagship feature. The other would provide pre-release insights and recommendations for a high-investment new feature designed to impact an important KPI. In other words, it’s a big bet for product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go where the buzz is. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, strongly consider choosing product’s big bet. When a lot of resources have been invested, the whole company is buzzing about it, and a key business metric is meant to be affected. You can be pretty certain that they’ll be open to hearing about any important insights that you find if it could impact the success of their big release! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Words matter: phrase your insights based on what Product cares about most&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to have the integrity to give over &lt;i&gt;the truth&lt;/i&gt;. We can’t bend insights so that they are 90 percent truth and 10 percent what our stakeholders want to hear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, we often have more agency than we think when we choose how to phrase our insights and recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most impactful way I’ve found to exercise my own agency when it comes to research results is to &lt;i&gt;allude to KPIs in my insights and recommendations&lt;/i&gt;. For example, add words to your recommendation like “there is a reasonable hypothesis that this iteration could positively affect the paid conversion rate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, we assume that stakeholders seeing results and taking our recommendations is obvious. Even if it is, seeing the words spelled out is a psychological strategy for capturing sustained attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invoking &lt;i&gt;paid conversion rate&lt;/i&gt; or another key metric is much more likely to land your recommendation a spot on product’s to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Craft your insights as simple, bold statements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in order to cover our bases and avoid the risk of taking a stand, we make statements that feel safe—but fail to inspire. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some users were confused by this screen. We should consider revisiting the copy to make it more explanatory.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this is okay. In reality, when I’m a product manager with hundreds of potential tasks to work on, words like “some” and “should consider” don’t exactly light a fire under me.  Something like this insight and recommendation may work better:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This screen generated a lot of confusion for users. We recommend testing new copy to see the impact on paid conversion rate. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we’re not inviting stakeholders to wonder, “Okay, but if it was just some users, maybe it’s not a big deal?” or “I don’t know if I’d prioritize a simple copy change.” Rather, we’re making the bold statement that enough confusion occurred among research participants to warrant action that could positively affect the KPI that we care about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt;: if you’re feeling uncomfortable about making a bold statement, check in with yourself. Are you lacking confidence for no good reason? Or is it possible that you need some more data in order to make the call confidently? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, if we only feel comfortable making a lukewarm statement that won’t confidently guide product in a specific direction, we need to make a change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that means mustering up the self-assurance to say what we know to be true. Other times it means we haven’t collected enough data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Work doesn’t end after delivering your insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the strategy behind what we prioritize and the words we use to communicate insights is key, you won’t land recommendations on product roadmap real estate by finessing your report or presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is we have to follow-up and involve ourselves in relevant processes to ensure our recommendations are not forgotten or dismissed. What exactly this means depends on the culture and structure of your organization, but here are a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schedule a follow-up meeting with the main stakeholder for a week or two after you present results.&lt;/b&gt; Agree on what you’ll come to the meeting with (perhaps the stakeholder will bring estimated dev time for one of your main recommendations before you meet, for example)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offer to do some leg work&lt;/b&gt;. For example, if a stakeholder isn’t sure whether something you’re suggesting is practical from a tech perspective, offer to have a conversation with the tech lead. This means less work for the stakeholder, and if you find that it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; feasible, you’ll have yet another opportunity to advocate for your recommendation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure other stakeholders are aware of your insights and recommendations&lt;/b&gt;. For example, if the main stakeholder was a product manager, make sure you distribute your results to the design team and developers as well. This increases the likelihood you’ll create internal advocates other than yourself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do you know if you’ve been successful at creating impactful insights and recommendations?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll state the obvious: if your recommendations are utilized, congrats—you’ve made an impact! If your suggestion led to a KPI improvement, even better. But to know, you have to stay on top of it, whether it’s via Slack channels or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;other integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that keep you informed about what’s going on in product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, sometimes your insights will have impact that isn’t top seat on the product roadmap yet. Here are some other good indicators that you’re making an impact:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your reports are linked or referenced in PRDs or presentations&lt;/b&gt; by the product team and used as part of the story or rationale for a feature or initiative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stakeholders other than the main points of contact for a given research project are asking you about your insight&lt;/b&gt;s. This means someone saw it as important enough to spread the word&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You’re asked to present your work to teams outside of product&lt;/b&gt;. This shows your insights can provide value to stakeholders in other places, such as marketing or senior management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s often mentioned that user researchers are forever chasing more impact—and with good reason. “Understanding” has no inherent value without action in a business environment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase your impact by prioritizing your work based on what matters most, evoking stakeholder goals every chance you get, making bold statements, and not jumping ship after your deliverables are delivered.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From IQ tests to design thinking: The complex origins and invisible legacy of brainstorming]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/from-iq-tests-to-design-thinking</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/from-iq-tests-to-design-thinking</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming has a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an outdated, naff, insufficiently structured, over-hyped process used only by people who don’t understand real facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s brainstorming’s reputation today. It was also brainstorming’s reputation almost immediately after it was introduced to America in 1953.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1963, Alex Osborn—a pioneer in the world of creative thinking methodologies—was describing brainstorming’s application, reputation, and limitations with scorn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“In the early 1950s, brainstorming became too popular too fast, with the result that it was frequently misused. Too many people jumped at it as a panacea, and turned against it when no miracles resulted.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alex Osborn, Applied Imagination (1963 edition)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborn was in a unique position to make these comments about brainstorming. He invented it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming was the most famous creative thinking methodology to emerge from America in the 1950s. The label eventually faded, but the method did not. The foundations of Osborn’s process, which he originally concocted in a desperate attempt to save his failing ad agency, are also the foundations of design thinking, the double diamond, and other innovation methodologies we use today. Methodologies that are still often treated as panaceas and are regularly treated as fundamentally unserious by people who work with things that can be measured—data, metrics, analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, after all, no obvious connection between the generative, creative nature of creative thinking and the painstaking work of quantitative research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming and its methodological descendants, however, were born from quantitative research. More specifically, they were born from a method that was itself developed in response to misapplied quantitative research methods and the misuse of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming as we think of it now—a group of people sitting in a room, coming up with random ideas—is, in fact, only the first step of three in the original brainstorming process. The second step is pausing to let the ideas settle (preferably overnight, according to Osborn), and the third is sorting and prioritizing the ideas with the goal of finding one or two that could solve the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designers will recognize this process. After all, it mirrors the one we use all the time. The idea generation phase uses divergence, and the prioritization phase uses convergence, the same way the double diamond does. The two main activities of brainstorming are not just aligned to the double diamond process—they share the same root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As adept as he was at showmanship, Osborn never claimed to have invented the labels “diverge” and “converge.” He attributes that insight to a different man: psychologist JP Guilford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guilford was a visionary. As early as 1950, he made this prediction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We hear much these days about the remarkable new thinking machines…We are told that (they will lead to) an industrial revolution that will pale into insignificance the first industrial revolution. The first one made man’s muscles relatively useless; the second one is expected to make man’s brain also relatively useless.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…eventually about the only economic value of brains left would be in the creative thinking of which they are capable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JP Guilford, Address to the American Psychological Association, 1950.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise of a technological revolution did not lead Guilford into creativity research. His original motive was much simpler: he wanted America to win the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the war, Guilford’s theory was that creative thinking was crucial to intelligence and leadership. His wartime role was in developing creativity testing processes for the American Air Force. The tests were a huge success, but Guilford had an advantage: he already knew what wouldn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That lesson came from an IQ test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final years of the First World War, hundreds of thousands of new soldiers flooded into the US Army. The Army needed a way to classify its capabilities quickly and at a massive scale. To this end, 1.7 million American soldiers were subjected to the “Army Alpha” IQ test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army Alpha, and its alternative for illiterate soldiers (Army Beta), was a standardized test that assessed soldiers’ ability to do things like identify patterns, arrange shapes, decode scrambled sentences, and follow instructions. The goal was to evaluate both the soldiers’ intelligence and their leadership potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the original IQ tests were never intended to measure leadership potential. What may be surprising is that they were never intended to measure intelligence. The test’s inventor, Alfred Binet, did not even believe that intelligence was a fixed attribute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“A few modern philosophers assert that an individual’s intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alfred Binet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binet’s purpose in inventing the IQ test was to identify children at risk of falling behind at school. The test made no assumptions about why a child may need extra support—they may be recovering from illness, or grieving. The IQ test’s only job was to find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Army Alpha test, it turned out, was good at finding people too. It excelled at identifying which soldiers were Black, which were recent immigrants who spoke little or no English, and very little else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Guilford was designing his tests for assessing creativity in pilots in World War Two, the more immediate failures of the Army Alpha test were well established. To Guilford’s eyes, the fundamental problem with the test was simple: the questions had only one correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He named the ability to solve problems with only one correct answer “convergent thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guilford was interested in more nuanced, less quantifiable problems—the kind that have many possible solutions. His goal was to assess and measure “the kind of intelligence that goes off in different directions.” He called this “divergent thinking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the story of the Army Alpha test ended there, the damage would at least be confined, but it didn’t. The dataset was too large and too tempting. Those 1.7 million test results, the ones that “proved” Black people and immigrants were inferior, became the foundation of “scientific eugenics” in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1923, a book based on the data from the Army Alpha test entered wide circulation. That book, liberally studded with graphs, charts, and authoritative-looking statistics, was called “A Study of American Intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;According to all evidence available, then, American intelligence is declining, and will proceed with an accelerating rate as the racial admixture becomes more and more extensive. The decline of American intelligence will be more rapid than the decline of the intelligence of European national groups, owing the the presence here of the negro. These are the plain, if somewhat ugly, facts that our study shows.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carl Brigham, ‘A study of American intelligence’ (1923).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of Brigham and his fellow eugenicists influenced American immigration policy for decades to come and American education permanently—he invented the SAT, which is based on the Army Alpha test and is still in use today. (The test’s other great legacy is global: it introduced the A, B, C, and D letter grading system.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eugenics’ other great legacy is eugenics itself. Eugenics was popular in mid-century America and other rich English-speaking nations among exactly the same people who it is increasingly popular with today: well-educated rich white people, especially those who work in, or aspire to work in, technology. Today’s eugenicist “pro-natalists,” whose ranks include Elon Musk, are mostly Silicon Valley types. They are as vulnerable to bad conclusions derived from bad data as any of their predecessors and may have even more potential to create mass harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years after “A Study of American Intelligence” was released, Brigham admitted that his book ignored the role of English language fluency among recent immigrants and that his earlier conclusions were “without foundation,” but the damage was done. He never retracted his beliefs about the intrinsic inferiority of Black Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failures that Brigham confessed to were not his only ones. Two distinct beliefs had coagulated in his thinking. These beliefs were shared by the men who implemented and advocated for the Army Alpha test and, eventually, most educated white people across America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first, already rejected by Binet, Guilford, most researchers at the time, and all researchers today, was that intelligence is a fixed attribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second, equally wrong but even more pervasive, was that intelligence is quantifiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mere numbers cannot bring out…the intimate essence of the experiment. This conviction comes naturally when one watches a subject at work…What things can happen! What reflections, what remarks, what feelings, or, on the other hand, what blind automatism, what absence of ideas!…The experimenter judges what may be going on in [the subject’s] mind, and certainly feels difficulty in expressing all the oscillations of a thought in a simple, brutal number, which can have only a deceptive precision.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alfred Binet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the Army Alpha test were strongly motivated to believe that intelligence was fixed and quantifiable. If those two things were true, the test results were valid and valuable; if they were not, they weren’t. The researchers had every incentive to maintain both their belief in fixed intelligence and their statistical methods for analyzing IQ test data, despite both being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that quantitative research is inherently harmful. Guilford, for example, tried with some success to create quantitative measurements for divergent thinking. His most famous creativity test, the “paperclip” test, asked participants to come up with as many uses as possible for a common household item, then scored both the number and originality of the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The person who is capable of producing a large number of ideas per unit of time, other things being equal, has a greater chance of having significant ideas.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JP Guilford&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was divergent thinking that led a desperate Alex Osborn to invent brainstorming in 1938. It was teaching people how to think in a divergent way that made brainstorming such a success. And so, inadvertently, Osborn’s brainstorming perfectly demonstrated what Binet and Guilford knew and the “scientific eugenicists” were so desperate to deny—that a person’s capacity for creative thinking, and therefore their intelligence, can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his brainstorming book, Osborn quotes Guilford on exactly this point:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Like most behavior, creativity probably represents to some extent many learned skills. There may be limitations set on these skills by heredity, but I am convinced that, through learning, one can extend the skills within those limitations. The least we can do is remove those blocks that are in the way.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JP Guilford, quoted in ‘Applied imagination’ (1957 edition)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both men, the path that led them to divergent thinking did not end there. How could it? They were divergent thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guilford went on to develop a multifaceted model of intelligence called “The Structure of the Intellect,” and Osborn collaborated with academics to expand his method into a comprehensive approach to creative problem-solving. The last version of that process was called the Osborn Parnes Creative Problem Solving Method. It was a five-step diverge-converge model published in 1967, after Osborn’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diverge-converge model is, of course, the foundation of the double diamond. The five steps of the Obsorn Parnes method have another legacy: they are the source of the five steps in “design thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence that Guilford, Osborn, and their fellow creativity practitioners have had on innovation methods today is obvious. Less obvious, but perhaps more important for those of us who work in technology, is the lesson of the Army Alpha test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shows us that there is no limit to the scale or scope of damage that bad data can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reveals that a research methodology that is valid and useful in one context may be profoundly dangerous in another. The IQ test was well designed for its original purpose of identifying children who needed help at school. It was only when it was used to generate data about attributes that are not fixed and cannot be quantified that it led to catastrophe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who work in the ambiguous, creative, divergent-thinking side of innovation are sometimes accused of a lack of rigor, and often with good reason. Some of our processes are over-hyped, and we don’t always deliver good insights or solutions. Eighty years or more of methodological progress, from Guilford’s diverge/converge through Osborn’s brainstorming and eventually into the double diamond and design thinking, still don’t guarantee success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s also true that the mere fact of being quantifiable does not make research valid and that being data-driven or even data-led can’t guarantee success either. If you use bad data as the foundation for problem-solving, you will always fail to solve the problem. But you might do something much worse, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guilford’s observation that creative thinking is more crucial to leadership than “intelligence” remains true today, as does Osborn’s insight that generating ideas is best done separately from refining them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also true, and a source of great hope, is something the evidence leaves no ambiguity about: all of us can get better at creative problem solving—including the problems we ourselves had a hand in creating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;To live is to have problems and to solve problems is to grow intellectually.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JP Guilford&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No researcher is an island: find your research heroes]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/no-researcher-is-an-island</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/no-researcher-is-an-island</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this article, you’re probably sold on the idea that research plays a critical role in understanding users and customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But researchers cannot be impactful if they work in isolation. Their success depends on their integration into an organization. This integration occurs, first and foremost, through collaboration with non-research stakeholders. And this collaboration starts, in grander terms, with Research Heroes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying and partnering with Research Heroes can be a powerful way to supercharge your research practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consultant, I regularly speak to people who have brought or are trying to set up a UX research practice in their organizations. After scores of these conversations, this is what I’ve learned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call them Research Heroes. Because of their dedication and perseverance, research has the champion it needs to make its start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to introduce you to one of the first Research Heroes I met. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroenmulder/&quot;&gt;Jeroen Mulder&lt;/a&gt;, former Head of Product Design at Mollie and currently Founder at First Follower, is one of those Research Heroes. A few years ago, he advocated for Mollie to hire their first UX researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Customers are our oxygen,” he said. “We’d better understand them well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeroen saw the challenge of getting research on board as broader than just headcount: he strove to enact a mindset shift, for example, by asking every decision maker: “How did you make this decision? Which insights did you use to assist you in your decision-making process?” He asks these questions as a means to highlight risk. If it’s not possible to mitigate risk with research, then at least stakeholders have acknowledged that before they proceed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers: I know many of you are considering taking on a founding role in a company. My wish for you is to be hired by—or collaborate with—a Research Hero like Jeroen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-researchers: You might be looking forward to your organization bringing on their first researcher. My wish is for you to feel employed to reach out to them for what could be a life-changing collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk a bit more about who this Research Hero is—and strategies to get and keep them involved in the research process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Research Hero’s role in a fledgling research practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a founding Lead UX Researcher at a company new to the concept of a research practice, I met a data analyst during my first weeks on the job. She was “on the list” of must-meet stakeholders and was immediately keen to build a relationship between data analysts and researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her enthusiasm planted the seeds of collaboration, and we began to approach challenges from both a quant and qual perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also remember the VP of Product Management carving out regular time for us to discuss our work in the bi-weekly PM meeting. He went beyond product and connected us across the organization, facilitating our contact with customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without these individuals, our efforts to make research an impactful practice would have been slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you find the Research Heroes at your company? Let’s look at how to identify them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Partnering with Research Heroes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your research practice has a foothold in an organization. This is a big win: But the role of the Research Hero is not finished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified them, here are some tips about how to partner with them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involve them in the research process&lt;/b&gt;. We’ve heard this time and again, but the more you include them, and the more they learn about what you do, the more they can evangelize your work to others. You know the drill: This could involve inviting them to participate in research sessions or providing them with access to research findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourage them to vocalize their advocacy&lt;/b&gt;. These individuals can be powerful advocates for research within the organization. This could involve inviting them to speak at company-wide meetings or providing them with the resources they need to champion research in their teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying and partnering with research heroes can be a powerful way to kick-start your research practice. And it can be extremely rewarding to see the results of these collaborations. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-scheminske/&quot;&gt;Megan Scheminske&lt;/a&gt; recently posted about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/megan-scheminske_product-managers-of-the-world-i-cant-tell-activity-7037221316092981248-e3WC/&quot;&gt;the result&lt;/a&gt; of finding a PM advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are you a Research Hero? Here are some ways to use your superpowers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re reading this and thinking, “Hey! I’m a Research Hero!” If this describes you, here’s how you can make yourself known to your researchers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking of your own Research Hero right now or someone who might become one? Do you think you might be one? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach out to each other! These Research Heroes made it possible for us to build our research practices from scratch and scale our practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who’s your Research Hero? What was their role? What did they do?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Do product professionals have a role to play as we explore AI and ethics?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/product-professionals-ai-and-ethics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/product-professionals-ai-and-ethics</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether you work in the tech industry or not, the questions, concerns, and possibilities surrounding AI are a global interest that’s likely to touch your life somehow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us who &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; in tech and working as product professionals are asking ourselves: what place, if any, do we have in the discourse and practicalities surrounding the ethics of AI as it unfolds in real-time? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we play a role in the ethical implementation of AI as its touch points with mainstream users unfold—or is it above our pay grade and out of our control?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The practicalities and ethics of AI: the discourse and the user experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first establish the landscape to explore possible answers to these questions. Essentially, two concurrent processes are happening regarding AI—the high-level, global discourse and the rapid development of user experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as the discourse surrounding AI and ethics, everyone from world leaders and academics to venture capitalists and tech leaders have chimed in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conversations can be confusing because the same people rapidly propelling us forward in integrating AI into everyday human experiences also express caution, warning the public about everything from potential racial discrimination to the widespread eradication of specific jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is there mixed messaging, but tensions are high (apparently, Elon Musk and Google Co-founder Larry Paige have even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tucker-carlson-friend-larry-page-refuses-talk-openai-2023-4#:~:text=Elon%20Musk%20said%20Larry%20Page%20hasn&apos;t%20spoken%20to%20him,electric%2Dcar%20maker&apos;s%20early%20days.&quot;&gt;ended their bromance&lt;/a&gt; due to conversations about AI safety). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to have something to say, and it’s unclear whether this heightened sense of awareness and chorus of important voices will result in any type of regulation, formal or informal, of AI ethics and safety.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product professionals can certainly engage in the conversation insofar as anyone can—online, in our communities, and so on. But I’d argue that the realm of user experience offers us a unique opportunity to be a part of the ethical implementation of AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where and how should artificial intelligence meet actual humans, and what does that interaction look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The user experiences of AI-fueled tech shouldn’t be a side conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the lofty discourse by influential people, thinking about UX can sometimes feel unimportant or beside the point. It’s not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user experience is the phenotype of the discourse; it’s where this rapidly evolving technology is meeting people in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product professionals are the last stop before technology meets users. We’ve had a tremendous impact on how humans all over the world interact with their phones, computers, and other technology. We call it UX, and it conjures up images of wireframes—but at its core, it’s much deeper than that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advances in AI will develop as they develop. If that’s outside of our skillsets or professional interests, we won’t likely impact its trajectory regarding ethical implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as AI is integrated into mainstream digital experiences, we can do what we do best to help ensure safety and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do I mean, exactly? To a large extent, in product, we represent the users themselves. We do so, of course, within the context of business goals and objectives—but we’re always on a quest to give the most value to our user base within the context of our KPIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that it makes both social sense and business sense to answer the true needs of real people—and now more than ever, we should try to utilize our skill sets to ensure that we’re doing that ethically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at &lt;i&gt;how.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three ways product pros can contribute to ethical user experiences in AI-driven technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly can we do? It’ll be the business leadership who determines the objectives and ultimately makes decisions about which technology to adopt—so where do we fit in?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are three relevant strategies for most product professionals, which we should all keep in mind starting yesterday.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plan user research with ethics in mind  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a user research lead, I know we’re pretty focused when planning research projects or initiatives. We want to explore the sentiments and behaviors of our research subjects, and we have to do so in a quick and agile way. This means we’re not always exploring aspects of the user experience that aren’t crucial to the immediate product tasks at hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, however, with the rapid development of AI and so many unknowns, everyone from user researchers to product managers should regard exploring issues of ethics as imperative in all related research rather than a sure-we-do-this-sometimes sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When integrating radically new technology, we should stretch our research questions to understand more in-depth how these products, features, and flows impact our users’ physical and emotional worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hard part, of course, is having the courage of our convictions based on what we find. If we have concerns about the ethics or safety of AI-driven technology and how it is implemented in the user experience, we must raise them internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ask further questions about user pain points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the pain points and challenges that users bring forth, whether from UX research, support teams, sales teams, or elsewhere, is generally a big part of what most product professionals do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maximize the value we give to users and meet our business goals, we have to understand where our users struggle and ideate solutions to those problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re working with AI-driven products and features, we should expect to find the unexpected when it comes to user pain points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may already have a great sense of your user base. Still, artificial intelligence technology is stretching our previously known limits in terms of what experiences we can craft for our users—their pain points may not fall into the realm of &lt;i&gt;the usual&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When going over user feedback from various internal teams, ask tough questions. Are user pain points&lt;i&gt; just &lt;/i&gt;UX issues? Or &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; a failure to solve real user needs? Or is it possible that the AI technology fueling features and flows is not respectful of the user—perhaps discriminatory or suggestive of another ethical issue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is product professionals have a responsibility to question what we think we already know and understand when it comes to our users. If we do, we can certainly impact the ethical implementation of AI as it applies to our respective products. As a community, that adds up to a big global influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use storytelling to help your organization understand the impact of AI on your users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product professionals are storytellers by nature: we tell the stories of the users to our colleagues, and we listen to the stories of our users in order to provide more value and help our organizations meet their business goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to AI, the various stakeholders at your company likely feel there are a lot of unknowns. It stands to reason that many of them are concerned about ethics as they follow the international discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you seek to truly understand the impact of artificial intelligence on the user experience and the users themselves, pay special attention to how you communicate your findings internally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions around AI in the media tend to be large in scope and theoretical in nature—don’t do that at your organization. Construct easy-to-understand narratives around what you’re learning as your team implements AI-fueled products and features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your ability to generate true and simple stories around AI internally will help ensure any of your colleagues with ethics and safety in mind will be armed with the necessary knowledge to make decisions that are good for your users. If the whole topic feels inaccessible—less so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not all doom and gloom: with vigilance, being a product professional as AI blooms is exciting and impactful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may or may not be old enough to remember when the internet began to truly go mainstream, but suffice it to say that people were excited—but also really worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We worried about privacy, ethics, physical safety, the health of our brains, and more. Decades on, we know that they weren’t wrong to be concerned—but we also know that, as a society, we’re committed to figuring it out in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people would agree that the danger and negatives brought on by internet access don’t necessarily cancel out the incredible access to knowledge, the ability to connect with others, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, more or less, is exactly what it means to be a product professional in the age of artificial intelligence. We’re not wrong to be worried, but the technology is here, and it’s developing rapidly. We’re in a situation where we can work to understand the technology and the people who utilize it to both mitigate risks and give new &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; wonderful value to people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product teams should be mindful of ethics and relentlessly question whether we’re making safe and respectful decisions toward our users. In parallel, we should take a moment to appreciate the magnitude of the opportunity to play a small role in learning and defining how AI can bring unforeseen possibilities to people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The roadmap to success is paved with insights]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/roadmap-to-insights</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/roadmap-to-insights</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Product Manager, you probably have the best intentions when building a product roadmap that is truly informed by user needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving real problems your users face and providing solutions for their unanswered needs is the likely path to meeting your overall goals. You already know that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even with the best intentions, it’s sometimes challenging to know exactly &lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;to use the customer data you’re getting from different sources—your UX research team, marketing, support or sales team, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you prioritize insights? How do you know which type of feedback to act on first? What’s important, and what’s just noise? Creating a user-centered product roadmap isn’t about acting on every single insight from every source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve tried that before, you’ve probably ended up harried and unsure about your direction. As a PM, you have to know how to employ user insights to serve your overall goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive deep into exactly how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it’s hard to incorporate user insights in your roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get into how to organize and utilize insights about users, it’s important to get on the same page about what’s difficult in the first place. Then we can address these challenges one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your insights are often qualitative. It’s hard to know the extent to which they’re relevant to your user base&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking at quantitative user insights, such as statistically significant survey data or A/B testing results, it’s easier to understand how your findings are relevant to your users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when dealing with qualitative insights, like single bits of feedback from one or two customers, it’s not always clear how representative they are of your user base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some user insights may conflict with your KPIs or goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon that user insights address product issues or needs that don’t align with your team’s current focus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, your company has a SaaS platform with an adjacent community feature. Your customer experience team may send feedback from key customers about how the community could be optimized to meet their collaboration needs. But perhaps for the next quarter, your team will be focusing on areas of the platform more associated with paid conversion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, you’ll work within the team goals—but what do you do with those insights? And how do you know when to come back to them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;User insights come from different teams with different perspectives, often all at once&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for a PM at Lightricks to receive user research results from my team on a given topic. Then user feedback from our customer experience team. &lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; then some information about how users are reacting to the same product iterations on social media—all at once.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these cases, it’s up to the PMs to decide which insights are the most relevant and actionable. This isn’t always intuitive, especially because people whose roles involve user advocacy tend to develop strong feelings and want to impact the product accordingly (guilty as charged).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So how should PMs organize, prioritize, and utilize user insights given all the challenges?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’m going to walk you through a method to ensure you’re using all of the insights that come your way as effectively as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to adjust each step to fit your organizational culture, but as you read, you’ll see that being intentional about insights instead of just &lt;i&gt;reacting&lt;/i&gt; to them is the main path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step one: Create a space to organize and tag your insights by topic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;a href=&quot;dovetail.com&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; like we do, you can organize your insights by relevant tags. This way, you can maintain an active list of all relevant insights per topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s some advice I learned the hard way: make your tags as specific as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the tag &lt;i&gt;product pain points&lt;/i&gt; may seem like a smart tag now, but your product team will likely address various user pain points at different times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the theme of pain points, I suggest creating a separate tag for each pain point that comes from any source of user insights. The general rule is to categorize your insights as specifically as possible to save time and frustration later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a place, whether within Dovetail like us or somewhere else (perhaps a FigJam board if you’re using Figma), the key is to put the user insight in its spot, appropriately tagged, every time you’re given one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring your insights are in the proper place and easily found when you need them means that you won’t risk forgetting or losing important insights when working on something relevant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this step allows you to cut out the noise. You have a space for all your insights. Now, you can browse and consider &lt;i&gt;only the insights you need for whatever you’re currently working on&lt;/i&gt; at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step two: Add additional tags for your company or team’s main KPIs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve already started to organize your user insights by topic, which is probably pretty intuitive for you as a PM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: one of the constant pressures of the PM role is to ensure that whatever you choose to prioritize at any given moment is aligned with your team’s most important KPIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you add KPI tags to your insights, you can ensure you don’t overlook opportunities to choose meaningful product iterations that can help you meet your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, given that we have a plethora of photo and video editing apps, export rate is a main usage KPI at Lightricks. We figure that if a user exports a photo or video after editing it in one of our apps, we likely helped them create something they’re happy with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if our customer experience team were to alert us to a usability issue with our export screen, I may tag that as “pain point - export screen” and include &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; tag like “export rate KPI.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get your quarterly goals and KPIs and need to plan your roadmap for the quarter, you can look at your past and recent insights related to that specific goal. You’ll find that you’ll remember opportunities to work on a particular metric you may have forgotten because it wasn’t relevant in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Step three: Create a habit of reviewing your insight tags weekly to look for new opportunities or relevant insights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set a weekly reminder to look through all user insights—either by topic, KPIs, or both—and ensure you’re not neglecting any information about users that could be useful to you in the moment or in future planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main point is that storing and tagging user insights is only the beginning. You have to review them regularly to ensure you’re incorporating relevant information about users in your work whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Now you have a system for organizing user insights and sorting them by goals. What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our system has addressed the noise of insights coming from different sources. If an insight conflicts with a KPI, it won’t appear on your screen when working toward that goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your sales team and user researchers send you insights on different platforms, now you have it all in one place so that you can find it when you need it and never forget it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your answer to prioritizing insights at any given time is to sort insights by whatever goals or KPIs are driving your product work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you know what to do with qualitative insights from a small user group?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Differentiate between qualitative research with a representative sample vs. user feedback from a few users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have user researchers delivering insights based on proper research methodology, they should be based on representative samples of users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your researchers deliver insights and recommendations, they’ll let you know to what extent this applies to your overall user base or if it only applies to specific segments. From there, you can decide which insights and recommendations have the best shot at helping you meet your current goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more complicated when it comes to things like feedback from a sales or support team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, an account manager may tell you one of your organization’s biggest clients requested a specific feature. That’s great information, but you’ll have to do more sleuthing before figuring out to what extent this feedback deserves your focus.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions to ask yourself (or your colleagues) about user insights that come from relatively few instead of a representative sample:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What were the problems or needs behind the request or feedback? Based on what you know about your user base, do these problems or needs apply to other segments of users?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What goals or KPIs does this feedback relate to? Could addressing the crux of this insight help you meet them?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does this feedback correlate at all with any of the feedback we’ve seen in the past?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve answered these questions, you should have a better idea of whether or not it’s relevant or helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick with less scientific feedback is to combine it with internal knowledge about users and determine if it’s helpful or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; beware of the self-selecting nature of user feedback (as opposed to user research). For example, it could be that 70 percent of last week’s support tickets were requests for a specific feature—that’s compelling! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But users who write to support to request features are a self-selecting group. You don’t know who used your product and &lt;i&gt;didn’t&lt;/i&gt; write to support because they didn’t think it was worth the effort or because your current feature set met their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take these types of feedback stats and ask the same questions we listed above to ensure you’re looking at it with a 360 perspective before making any product decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A user-centered roadmap doesn’t mean reacting to every user insight immediately&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a PM, your job is to ensure your customer insights are categorized by goal and topic so that you never miss an opportunity to serve your user base and help your organization meet its most important goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means having a goal-first mindset. Use insights when they help move you toward overall goals, and review them periodically to ensure you aren’t missing anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various teams at your organization will give you relevant insights that aren’t immediately actionable. With your new system for organizing user information, you can save it for later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, a user-centered roadmap isn’t a series of reactions to everything you learn about your users. A user-centered roadmap results from a product manager integrating insights selectively and intelligently based on their goals and KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Do we need humans for user research?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/humans-user-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/humans-user-research</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, with the release of ChatGPT, discussions about artificial intelligence became rampant on social media. AI advancements have the potential for great impact across a wide range of professional fields, with UX research being no exception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For researchers, the posts that first emerged discussed how to (or why not to) use AI to accomplish tasks like fleshing out study design or synthesizing data from qualitative research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, however, the discussion has turned to another issue that impacts the core of our work: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do we need actual humans to conduct user research? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is far from hypothetical. There are already companies marketing access to AI-generated users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument goes: AI-generated users mimic the characteristics and perspectives of real users. Tech companies can purchase access to these AI-generated users and then “user test” their products without the hassle and cost of recruiting humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies offering AI-generated users sell their services as time-saving. Indeed, they would be. Participant recruitment can be one of the most time-consuming parts of conducting UX research, especially in companies that don’t have easy access to their users or haven’t had the time or resources to build a panel of representative users for testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this case? It’s not all about the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspected that, for researchers, the issues would extend far beyond convenience. With this in mind, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janelleward1_ai-userresearch-recruitment-activity-7050021566377533440-TSR7/&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn, posing the following hypothetical scenario: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anticipated, researchers have a lot to say on this subject. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rstegbauer/&quot;&gt;Ruben Stegbauer&lt;/a&gt; kicked it off with an excellent overview of issues to consider: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruben covered aspects related to how expert researchers approach their practice, like questioning biases and comparing attitudinal and behavioral data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He mentioned issues related to AI as a tool, such as difficulty assessing validity. And he noted that “cheap and easy” might be a competitive disadvantage for companies that decide to take this route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, research experts from various domains chimed in with a range of responses: An empirical view of a “let’s test it” approach, a rejectionist view of a (still) flawed technology, and a practical view, with a reminder that AI is not human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The empirical view: Let’s test it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we really know that using AI-generated users will generate subpar results? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of reactions that tell us why. But what if we start with an empirical view? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words—let’s test it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmillspaysbills/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Miller&lt;/a&gt; made this pragmatic suggestion. We do this when considering new tools in our research practices. Why not view synthetic users the same way? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-huyton-946a7121b/&quot;&gt;Emma Huyton&lt;/a&gt; agreed with Jeremy’s comment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdovedesign/&quot;&gt;Meghan Dove&lt;/a&gt;, skeptical that AI will live up to human results, posted a well-articulated reasoning for such empirical testing. In part, she said:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An algorithm is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Demonstrate to me that you trained your algorithm with datasets that used the same rigorous, scientific approach that a good researcher does, and I’ll consider testing your solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonstrate to me that you have captured significant amounts of data from users who represent the population I’m studying, show me your ‘users’ are based on the diverse segments, backgrounds, and experience levels of the ones I currently interview, that you’re basing ‘user opinions’ on the real opinions of diverse groups, that you used real data, had enough data to recognize reliable patterns, and that you’re not putting words in the mouths of users.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others recoiled at testing synthetic and human participants to compare results. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferlouiseharmon/&quot;&gt;Jennifer Harmon&lt;/a&gt;, for example, replied with this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand Jennifer’s point. And those adamantly opposed to introducing and potentially adopting AI-generated users into our research processes may also reject this prospect. But I do appreciate the pragmatism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because we do not work in research bubbles. We will have non-research stakeholders who see the promise of greater speed and fewer costs and will want to consider changes to our research processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to demonstrate the potential problems with this new technology is by using our expertise—research—to show why humans rule when it comes to user research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-scharff-5a418b45/&quot;&gt;Alec Scharff&lt;/a&gt; placed the burden of proof on companies creating and marketing such products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they should be conducting highly rigorous studies and transparently sharing the results. He also made a valid point: “...why not skip ‘synthetic user research’ and just create a synthetic marketplace that directly predicts how well your product will sell?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The rejectionist view: the technology is inherently/currently flawed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pragmatic view, though worth mentioning, was somewhat overruled by the reaction of many others. A lot of researchers want nothing to do with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commenters made it clear that these points are essential in the discussion: &lt;b&gt;AI is only as good as the data it is trained on.&lt;/b&gt; It may not be able to account for biases or cultural differences in its conceptualization of users or its mimicry of user attitudes. Given these flaws, how can we justify such a radical change to our research practices? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replying to Meghan Dove, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-bufford-funk/&quot;&gt;Carolyn Bufford Funk, PhD&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, “The average will typically miss the nuance and insight of the experts (who are not average). And a training set of the internet will necessarily exclude or under-represent (and therefore likely misrepresent) populations with no or limited internet access.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomicivins/&quot;&gt;Naomi Civins, PhD&lt;/a&gt; illustrated another problem well, reminding us of what we’re often seeking when we conduct research with real people:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosava/&quot;&gt;Rosa Vieira de Almeida 卢苇&lt;/a&gt; offered the perspective from content design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others took the ultimate rejectionist view and didn’t see the point in engaging with engagement in the discussion at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmspool/&quot;&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt; said, “No matter how much we try to convince folks, many will ignore our logic and arguments. They’ve already decided. We can burn calories on a futile cause, or we can go do other more productive things with our time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The practical view: Aren’t our users human?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several commenters focused on pointing out what may seem obvious but is sometimes overlooked: &lt;b&gt;We are designing products to be used by humans. Shouldn’t we then test with humans? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleighacerni/&quot;&gt;Aleigh Acerni&lt;/a&gt; provided this perspective: Are we selling to humans or AI-generated customers? She does a great job of bringing it back to the current lack of empirical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinisasso/&quot;&gt;Vinicius Sasso&lt;/a&gt; said, “I am here wondering why are they so excited about synthetic users when their products will be used (and judged) by actual people whose behavior is totally nuanced and influenced by context, culture, habits, and personal differences. If even twin brothers behave differently from each other, where is this self-assurance that synthetic users will provide solid data for their design and development processes coming from?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, human-centered research is crucial, and human-centered research comes from conducting research with—you guessed it, humans. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasianwilson/&quot;&gt;Thomas Wilson&lt;/a&gt; put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicchamberlain/&quot;&gt;Nic Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt; summarized the main point, short and sweet, and a great one to remember: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be ignoring the elephant in the room to neglect that a co-founder for one of the companies selling AI-generated users for research was quite active in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He even asked me if I was behind a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEmh92L1uQUwq1aP9Ns6X9H_S0iluj1Kg8kjlZJzYB3Mxobg/viewform&quot;&gt;google form&lt;/a&gt; from a group called Researchers Against Synthetic Users (I’m not, but I’d also love to know who is!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice to him, echoing several other commenters, would be this:  If you’re building a tool that radically augments the work of user researchers, it’s probably best to reach out to them to better understand their problem space. Real, human user researchers. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Five things designers need to know before they do UX research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/designers-ux-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/designers-ux-research</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ll out myself immediately: I believe having dedicated user researchers on a product team is preferable to product designers doing their own research. It’s a topic for another time, but suffice it to say that things like hard research skills and increased objectivity that researchers tend to lend themselves to increased reliability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, we’re amid economically uncertain times, which means many designers don’t have a research team to work with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, when there isn’t another choice, I’d frame this as a great opportunity for designers to gain or refine another set of skills and new perspectives that contribute to excellent product design. Here are five things you should know before incorporating UX research into your work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Since you’re already a design thinker, you’re not starting from zero &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design thinking is essentially creative and practical problem-solving. As a product designer, you’ve already got the same mindset as a researcher in the sense that you’re an investigator of the user experience. You’re always sniffing out user problems and brainstorming solutions in your day-to-day work, and that’s precisely what user researchers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fact alone should raise your confidence and sense that &lt;i&gt;I can do this&lt;/i&gt;, and now you can read on for some tips to ensure you start your research journey off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User research is a collection of hard skills, and you may not have honed them yet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that product teams often talk about research using casual semantics like &lt;i&gt;talking to users&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;just doing a few user tests&lt;/i&gt; is misleading, and this is an important fact to accept right off the bat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;User research includes a huge variety of methods—interviews, usability testing, diary studies, ethnography, concept testing, participatory design, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning, executing, analyzing, and churning out actionable insights with user research methodology is not intuitive. Doing it reliably—so that you get accurate information to arm your whole product team with—requires you to hone those skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s completely possible, especially for a design thinker like you. Still, you’ll have to approach it with the humility that you may not know everything yet because, somewhat shockingly, many design educations do not include robust research methodology coursework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User interviewing is not &lt;i&gt;just talking to users.&lt;/i&gt; It’s important to familiarize yourself with best practices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re tasked with doing your own research, you’ll likely be conducting user interviews since it’s generally considered a core research practice, and for that reason, I’ll delve into it a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before interviewing users, you’ll want to read as much as possible about best practices (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/qualitative-research-skills/&quot;&gt;try this one&lt;/a&gt;, for example). Here are a few critical rules of thumb for you to keep in mind as you get started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t ask leading questions.&lt;/b&gt; As you read more about how to conduct good user interviews, you’ll learn that how you ask a question greatly influences the answer you get—and leading questions are one of the most common culprits when it comes to asking questions in a way that makes users’ answers less reliable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, a great way to avoid this is to ensure your question doesn’t include a potential answer. For example: &lt;i&gt;“Do you find it easy to search for specific recipes within the app?” &lt;/i&gt;suggests to a user that they &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; find it easy or that you &lt;i&gt;want them&lt;/i&gt; to say that they find it easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, asking: &lt;i&gt;Tell me more about your experience searching for specific recipes within the app&lt;/i&gt; invites the user to tell you whatever comes to mind about their experience. It makes it much more likely that you’re getting a close-to-reality version of their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We are all terrible at predicting our future&lt;/b&gt;. When possible, ask about past or current behavior and sentiments instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d all love it if we could simply ask users, &lt;i&gt;would you use X feature if we added it to the platform?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Would you pay extra for it?&lt;/i&gt; Then, we could ask the right people at the proper volume and always know what we were building would affect our bottom-line metrics. We’d never waste any time, ever again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while I hate being the bearer of bad news, here it is: human behavior depends on so many things, and when you ask people to predict their own, the responses are often people-pleasing, aspirational, or given without much thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to ask for previous or current behavior examples to assess the likelihood of future behaviors. For example, asking a user &lt;i&gt;Tell me about the last time you cooked something using a recipe in the app &lt;/i&gt;and hearing about what was challenging will give you a better clue about how you can help over asking &lt;i&gt;if we build a voice feature, so you don’t have to keep checking the recipe, would it make it easier for you? &lt;/i&gt;Remember: past or present &amp;gt; future predictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who you interview matters.&lt;/b&gt; Write out your research goals—what questions are you trying to answer? Then spend some time defining who the research sample should include. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to interview your current users? People who use your competitors? Users who are in a certain geographic area? Don’t skip over this part because who you interview greatly influences the data you generate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you only interview your power users in a research project where your goal is to find your product’s most frustrating pain points for a certain user segment. In that case, you won’t likely collect any perspectives from your most frustrated users, who are valuable considering your research goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Qualitative data is data; analyzing it isn’t just &lt;i&gt;a sense&lt;/i&gt;—it’s a concrete process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen people conduct great interviews—and then just list what is top of mind regarding takeaways without doing any qualitative analysis process. This is a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; mistake and almost certainly results in inaccurate insights and misguided product iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you conduct ten user interviews on a specific topic or conduct 20 usability studies. That’s a lot of data collected. What you remember when you “sum it up” in your mind is what &lt;i&gt;stood out to you&lt;/i&gt; when you’re summarizing, &lt;i&gt;not an accurate analysis of the scope and frequency that various points came up in your research.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you remember and keep top-of-mind is subject to many biases that can trip up your ability to get accurate insights. For example, confirmation bias is the tendency to remember what confirmed our pre-research assumptions—or recency bias, which is the tendency to remember what happened toward the end of your research versus the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Proper qualitative analysis the best way to ensure research insights and resulting action items are &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher, this is my absolute favorite part of the research process because it &lt;i&gt;always &lt;/i&gt;surprises&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;me in some way. Whether you feel that way or not, embrace it—because it’s a must-have, not a nice-to-have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find &lt;i&gt;affinity diagramming&lt;/i&gt; the simplest analysis method that aligns with design thinking and has a relatively small learning curve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, affinity diagramming involves clustering data by theme. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-affinity-diagramming/&quot;&gt;this guide to affinity diagramming &lt;/a&gt;on Dovetail for more direction on getting started with this analysis method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Check your emotions at the door and be a truth seeker&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a product designer doing your own research, you’re being asked to question your assumptions and potentially critique your work for the good of the user experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s obvious to you or not—this can be difficult. It’s hard to have been completely convinced you’ve designed the perfect solution for a user need over several months and then conduct research that suggests otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to not only admit to yourself that you were wrong about something but likely to your colleagues as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When conducting and analyzing research, forget that you’re the designer. Forget that you’ll be moving pixels and backtracking on things you said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is a time to view yourself simply as a truth seeker. Remind yourself that the purpose of doing user research in the first place is to get to the bottom of things so that your whole team can generate good ideas, improve the user experience, solve problems, and move forward based on true insights rather than assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, being tasked with doing your own user research as a designer can be overwhelming—but armed with design thinking and enough humility to refine or hone the necessary skills, you’re well on your way to demystifying the user experience for the benefit of your entire organization. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Improving your product gut biome]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/improving-your-product-gut-biome</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/improving-your-product-gut-biome</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there: A decision about the product needs to be made quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s a small design decision. Maybe it’s a roadmap prioritization decision. For any number of reasons, there’s no time for research. The team has to move forward, and they decide to “go with their gut.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does that mean, exactly: “going with your gut”? Shouldn’t we be “going with our brains”? And why are some people’s “product guts” healthier than others? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into answering those questions, it’s important to acknowledge that not everyone is a fan of using “gut” to make product decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have colleagues who line up on both sides of the debate. Some are skeptical of anyone who doesn’t believe using their gut is an important part of building great products. And others believe that all decisions should be made empirically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When making “gut” decisions, we can’t overlook the critical pitfalls to watch out for and remediate against. Strong product leaders (regardless of whether they’re product managers, designers, or researchers) know they need to remove their egos when evaluating decision success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the more we rely on our “gut”—regardless of how healthy it is—the more difficult it is to extract our ego from the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, when running experiments, our goal is to objectively evaluate the outcome and derive important insights. Effective experiments allow us to embrace and learn from the results, regardless of whether the hypothesis is true or false. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when our egos are involved, the experiment can easily become perverted into evaluating our ability to make good judgment calls. In other words, if my hypothesis is false, I’m wrong, and my product gut isn’t as good as I thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My ego will undoubtedly be challenged, and I will look for data to feed my bias, ignoring the facts before me. In these situations, only the best leaders will be confident to acknowledge their mistakes and quickly change course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the two are not mutually exclusive. In fact, I’d even argue they are dependent on one another—a sort of a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection&quot;&gt;brain-gut connection&lt;/a&gt;” of the product kind. And with that being said, let’s dive into what it means when we decide to “go with our gut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean to “go with your gut”?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My incredibly gifted colleague, Jo Oakley, and I were having just this conversation when Jo wisely pointed out that what we call our “product gut” really just comes down to exposure to research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That is, your product gut is really the ability to draw from a broad reservoir of knowledge based on countless customer interviews, surveys, and analyses of behavioral data to inform product decisions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product gut includes knowledge specific to your product and customers and insights about how humans think about and engage with technology. It’s why the amount of research you need to conduct is directly correlated with problem clarity—or, conversely, how much you can trust your gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do we trust our gut instead of our brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let’s move to question number two: why do we trust our gut instead of our brain to make decisions? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it’s both. Humans intuitively know about this brain-gut connection; our first encounter is often a dance recital, a piano performance, or a public speaking class. Our nervousness or anxiety manifests as “butterflies” in our stomachs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection between our knowledge and experiences and their genuine gastrointestinal manifestations causes us to associate intellect with “gut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we can’t always trust the human body to be an accurate barometer of the reality of a situation (ask anyone with a fear of public speaking). We can, however, train it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, product teams can teach their guts to become more accurate sensors that drive product decisions. But, like any training program, it takes time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are some people’s “product guts” healthier than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests that eating yogurt can improve gut health. It may also help relax brain function under stress, reducing the likelihood of panic, burnout, or despair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, eating yogurt positively impacts mood and decision-making—the brain-gut connection at work. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://radiolab.org/podcast/197112-guts&quot;&gt;this Radiolab&lt;/a&gt; episode for more information on that phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving the &lt;i&gt;product&lt;/i&gt; brain-gut connection follows a very similar formula. If our “product gut” really comes down to “exposure to research” and a healthy (product) gut biome is critical to making better decisions, the formula is straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to improve your “product gut” biome is to enjoy a regular diet of research insights through various methods and channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as your actual gut biome is comprised of a complex interdependency of different species, your “product gut biome” likewise requires exposure to and triangulation of a broad spectrum of quantitative and qualitative data about your customers, prospects, competitors, and the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research is the yogurt of the product gut.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like yogurt, research feeds the product gut biome, providing it with a rich diversity of data and insights. This healthy gut feeds the product brain, facilitating faster, more accurate decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The fine print&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even among the healthiest product gut biomes, it’s important to continue incorporating exercise and a healthy diet. Always define time-bound, outcome-driven KPIs for success and failure before a launch. And put structures in place to ensure a cross-functional team reviews those measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between a steady diet of research and a regiment of best practice exercises, you’re sure to have a strong and healthy product brain-gut connection!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[PM or UXR]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/pm-or-uxr</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/pm-or-uxr</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Being a UXR doesn’t automatically exclude you from decision-making power; being a PM doesn’t mean you get it. &lt;b&gt;It depends on the organization&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are you getting the most out of the research community?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-community</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-community</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a current or aspiring user researcher or a product professional who sometimes does research—you’ve probably noticed the online research community has exploded lately. There are a ton of both curious and talented professionals who are &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; ready to chat research and are often generous with their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, sometimes it’s difficult to figure out how to &lt;i&gt;utilize&lt;/i&gt; the community when you find yourself in a position where you could use help and advice. Let’s look at the difficulties in harnessing the power of the community and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s difficult about using the research community when you need help?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doing user research, there are plenty of best practices and industry standards to rely on. However, no matter how diligent you are in informing yourself or how much experience you have, studying humanity for a living is full of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprises can come from budget constraints, insane timelines, unexpected results, stakeholder problems, or other unique circumstances. We’re all researching in an environment with its own unique business and mission, but also varying budgets, attitudes toward user research by management, organizational structures, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re looking for advice by crowdsourcing a solution, you’ll often find other researchers appear to miss the mark or offer advice that doesn’t suit your particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, theoretical information is accessible on various blogs and websites, but practical advice is much harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re beyond the basics, like how to build rapport during user interviews or the pros and cons of various participant recruiting tools, the reality is that many areas where you’ll need help involve a lot of internal knowledge and professional judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another barrier to leaning on the community when you need help is the fear of outing yourself as &lt;i&gt;not knowing something&lt;/i&gt; in a small, tight-knit community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep down, many of us are afraid crowdsourcing research answers could reflect poorly on our abilities as a researcher. Is it possible that the person who answers me today will be the hiring manager interviewing me later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these challenges can only mean one thing: most of us probably aren’t utilizing the power of the research community to its fullest potential—and that’s a shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three strategies for using the community to learn and grow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three tried and tested methods for getting the most out of the research community. Whether you’re a full-time researcher or someone who does research like a designer or product manager, follow these steps and you’ll become a pro in no time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Invest heavily in one-on-one relationships within the community&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you find someone else who does user research, perhaps in a similar organization or background, nurture those relationships one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s in a Slack channel, on LinkedIn, or at a local meetup—don’t be shy. Approach others in the community and suggest a virtual or face-to-face coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s why this matters: generally speaking, you can read up on the basics. You’re much more likely to get inspiration and tactical, strategic insight when you have other researchers or PwDR (people who do research) with whom you can have a nuanced conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing in these relationships is a great way to foster a mutually beneficial arrangement. You can both make yourselves available to discuss each other’s questions and predicaments. Not only that, but you don’t have to worry about privacy or any of your other crowdsourcing concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve initiated around a dozen virtual and face-to-face coffees with researchers I didn’t know personally, and I have yet to be turned down. Don’t be shy about sending that message on LinkedIn or exchanging numbers with someone at your local UXR meetup—it pays off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When you do crowdsource, tell the crowd who and what you need&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started my first full-time role as a UXR, I remember asking for advice about the pros and cons of two usability testing platforms on a LinkedIn UXR community. The responses often lacked context. For example, a bunch of people said, “XYZ all the way!” and indicated their preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even those who gave a bit more reasoning behind their preferences could only be helpful in a limited way because they lacked the context in which they worked. Over time, I realized that when you crowdsource, people &lt;i&gt;guess&lt;/i&gt; what you want to know based on what you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there is sometimes incredible benefit in asking a lot of researchers in one place for their thoughts, insights, and advice—particularly when your question &lt;i&gt;isn’t&lt;/i&gt; super detailed or specific to your precise situation. But if you crowdsource, be explicit with what you need. Here’s a handy guide to help you do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, many of us ask questions of others in the research community in a “quick post,” but putting some thought into what you write makes it much more likely you’ll get real, actionable advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Positioning yourself as a learner isn’t necessarily a bad thing when it comes to your career prospects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hear and have personally experienced the fear of coming across as lacking in knowledge in front of the community. If you’re a senior UX researcher lacking a fundamental skill, perhaps it’s warranted. But for the most part, doing user research is complex, and most of us need advice or additional perspectives throughout our day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of the UXR community, I like to think about asking for quality advice and insights in a public forum as positioning myself as a learner. As someone who &lt;i&gt;leads&lt;/i&gt; a user research team, I recognize the value of hiring employees who know what they don’t know and utilize the resources available to them to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn to challenge that nagging feeling that you shouldn’t ask questions in public forums—it may be preventing you from getting extra value from the research community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we all have much to gain by putting some strategic thought into how we interact with the community. Being specific about what we want to learn, investing in one-on-one relationships, and getting comfortable with being a lifelong learner can all help you get the most out of and give back to this talented and generous pool of professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top three community links&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dovetail Slack user group: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://join.slack.com/t/heydovetail/shared_invite/zt-1s1u5h6g6-wvNLAIf1i328110gG231Ig&quot;&gt;Join here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mixed Methods: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mixedmethods.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;Join here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ReOps: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://researchops.community/&quot;&gt;Join here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;

What frustrates you? What would you change if you could?

Here are some brief ones I’ve heard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traitors!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So that’s the secret.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve learned to work the system! Good for them. Now we’ll have more PMs with solid research skills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is unsustainable. We are supposed to be working on cross-functional teams where we all bring our expertise to the table. Designers, developers, researchers…We should not have the feeling that the PM holds all the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The complex relationship between UXRs and PMs &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, so we’re back here again. Two short months ago, &lt;i&gt;Outlier&lt;/i&gt; published my article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/outlier/rival-or-partner/&quot;&gt;Is product a UX rival or partner?&lt;/a&gt; I took a critical look at a 2021 Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) article titled &lt;i&gt;UXers and Product Managers Both Say Others Intrude on Their Work&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-product-managers-overlap/&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pm-ux-different-views-of-responsibilities/&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NN/g survey showed evidence that UX and product often duplicate work to frame the conflict between UX and product management. For research tasks in particular—discoveries, user interviews, and user testing—PMs and UXers differed significantly in assigning the responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However: UXRs moving to PM roles to gain decision-making power—well, that’s a different can of worms. For the UXRs wanting to transition to product management, the problem doesn’t seem to be duplicative research tasks, but rather &lt;b&gt;who gets to decide what happens with the insights from those tasks&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My criticism of the NN/g survey was this: because it looks at global answers, the responses do not necessarily mean conflict occurs within a particular organization. Rather, it’s a commentary on how our roles intersect industry-wide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s where my previous article crosses with this one: &lt;b&gt;If UXRs are moving into PM roles with the belief that they will hold more decision-making power, this belief results from (their perception of) their specific company culture&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The company level: The role of organizational culture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a UXR doesn’t automatically exclude you from decision-making power; being a PM doesn’t mean you get it. &lt;b&gt;It depends on the organization&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is far from my insight alone—check out some of the comments on my post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/in-carlos-alvarez/&quot;&gt;Carlos Alvarez de la Vega&lt;/a&gt; took a true research perspective and laid out the foundations of a study begging for some curious mind to pursue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Might this have to do with the company’s UX maturity?... I’m curious to know more about the context at these folks’ workspaces. Did they switch roles at the same company? Did they leave to focus on the product? How do they exercise that ‘power’ now at their roles?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an organization where cross-collaborative trust is high—where researchers are “at the table” and have their perspectives considered in decision-making—this can work well, particularly for researchers who want to feel included in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that trust isn’t there, and no matter how they try, researchers feel their work is dismissed, frustration grows. In other words, they fail to escape “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janendavis_uxresearch-decisionmaking-designresearch-activity-7039374888737935361-LFLR&quot;&gt;service mode&lt;/a&gt;” (as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/janendavis/&quot;&gt;Jane Davis&lt;/a&gt; recently posted).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it all depends on your perspective on how decision-making works. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinekalnina/&quot;&gt;Kristine Kalnina&lt;/a&gt; put this well in her comment: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to say where the decision-making power lies. Is it with the one who finally says ‘yes’ to taking action, or with someone who influences the decision makers *into* saying yes? &lt;b&gt;When the head turns left, is it the head that’s turning or the neck that supports it?&lt;/b&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The individual level: The career direction of the tech professional&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s back up a minute. Of course, I recognize a few remarks I heard from UXRs-turned-PMs do not represent an industry-wide truth. What if we step back from organizational realities and look at specific individuals making the switch? What motivated them? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelena-golubovic/&quot;&gt;Jelena Golubovic&lt;/a&gt;, a UXR turned PM, described her choice to transition like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I see work in product as problem-solving, the product discovery phase being key….And yes, the decision-making power is greater, but so is the responsibility and the wider context you have. All of a sudden, it becomes clearer that there are many factors in deciding what gets done next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comment opens up a new understanding of the transition. As researchers, we are told our role is to represent the user through expert research. Turning to product management isn’t choosing power over the user—it recognizes that &lt;b&gt;you thrive in broadening your approach to the problem space&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do UXRs-turned-PMs still see research as a key part of their job? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelena-golubovic/&quot;&gt;Jelena&lt;/a&gt; has found a way to combine the two with a refreshing perspective on how to handle solution-driven customers in a B2B context:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I ‘do research’ by turning customer calls into discovery sessions. So if a customer really wants to talk to a PM about how much they need feature X (which is a ready-made solution that may or may not be the right one), I use the face time with them to ask a ton of questions, see what they are trying to do and why and try to get to a shared understanding of their problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;To UXR or to PM?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s your role? What do you want to bring to the table? And have you found an organization that allows this type of contribution to shine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies see the PM as the ultimate decision-maker: managing multiple perspectives and keeping an eye on the big picture. &lt;a href=&quot;http://practicalbydesign.co&quot;&gt;Erik Flowers&lt;/a&gt;, cofounder at Practical by Design, provided another great analogy between the roles of UXRs and PMs: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it comes right down to it, PMs are the ‘building site superintendents’ and the other IC roles are the subcontractors (framers, concrete pourers, drywallers, electricians, plumbers, roofers... etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The superintendents make sure we have all the building permits, look at the budget that pays the subs, schedules how to stack them (can’t drywall til you rough-in electric, can’t roof until your framers have decking up, etc.). They work with the owner (the homeowner or the commercial building owner, etc.) to monitor their needs, and they also do the ultra-important job of managing change-orders and ensuring overall site safety, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people love this, some people hate this, some probably never stopped to think about it, but it’s just the real-world manifestation of how things occur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a labor subcontractor and specialize in a trade, you pick an IC role, maybe even your own company, have a crew of dozens, but no electrician of any seniority ever makes decisions about the whole-home construction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be the labor supervisor, be a PM.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was eye-opening. However: is it a scenario that all companies live up to? In the tech world, at least from the UXR side, there’s lots of discussion about ensuring our insights are actionable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we just do our part and leave the big-picture decisions to someone else, we might not fulfill that actionable aspect—&lt;b&gt;especially if the PM doesn’t see research insights as a part of their decision-making process&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another perspective worth acknowledging is that some people don’t want decision-making power. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/haxuco_the-only-reason-product-managers-have-power-activity-7038903156788862976-UGkP&quot;&gt;Hang Xu&lt;/a&gt; recently posted an interview clip with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/petermerholz/&quot;&gt;Peter Merholz&lt;/a&gt;, who gave this pearl of wisdom: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only reason Product Managers have power is because they’re held accountable. They’re like yeah, I’m the person in charge, and I’m the person to blame, and I’ll take that on. And designers are wary of embracing that accountability, at least historically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People change their roles all the time. Both personal goals and their environment drive the decision. It’s worth taking moments like these to reflect on &lt;b&gt;how you like to approach the problem space&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Research in a recession ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-in-a-recession</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/research-in-a-recession</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Did bad data drive your last decision?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/bad-data-decision</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/bad-data-decision</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that 87.5 percent of all UX research-generated statistics are false?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;87.5 percent!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, that’s not true. I made it up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But did you believe me, even for a second?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it because I used numbers? Or because you’re reading an article in a publication you’ve grown to trust, written by a research expert?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might happen to you in daily life, too. Think of all the “research” thrust upon us—in commercials, billboards, and news articles. I grew up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksbT3gekjmA&quot;&gt;television commercials&lt;/a&gt; telling me all sorts of convincing things, like “four of five dentists surveyed recommend sugarless gum for their patients who chew gum!” Something about those numbers made me believe—Trident gum wasn’t only delicious but somehow healthy because dentists liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is it about the process of creating and sharing these statistics that makes them so compelling to humans? Joel Best, the author of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Damned-Lies-Statistics-Untangling-Politicians/dp/0520219783&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Damned Lies and Statistics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says that all statistics are products of social activity, a process sociologists call &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism&quot;&gt;social construction&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statlit.org/pdf/2002bestasa.pdf&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; we “assign statistics ‘facticity,’ that is, they are presumed to be facts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we want to understand the extent of a problem, intervention, or other issues, we tend to treat statistics as objective and indisputable. In the process, we ignore how these numbers were &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; or how they are being &lt;i&gt;shared&lt;/i&gt;—or by whom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also deal with these social processes in professional contexts: at work and in our broader network, like on LinkedIn. Let’s start with an example from the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When experts endorse faulty research findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently spotted a perfect storm after reading a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7031271931211386880/&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveblank/&quot;&gt;Steve Blank&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he references an article titled, &lt;i&gt;Startups That Have Employees in Offices Grow 3 1/2 Times Faster&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His post reads: “Data shows that pre-seed and seed startups with employees showing up in a physical office have 3½ times higher revenue growth than those that are solely remote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the discussion begin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion did indeed begin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I dove into the data on which the article is based, it turns out the headline is quite misleading. My comment on his post, reproduced below, looks more closely at why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you look at the comments on Steve Blank’s post, you see lots of questions criticizing the data. Hello, critical readers! Nice to have you here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you also see a lot of comments from company leaders running with the headline, posting things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans are social creatures by nature.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“...in my bones, I believe people can co-create more fluidly if they do it in the same room.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not even surprised.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-known figure looks at a poorly executed study, writes an article about it, and shares it with a misleading headline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At work, we are surrounded by the result of poorly-informed decisions every day: This is one example of how it begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example isn’t about debating remote versus in-office culture or how this differs based on company size, industry, or other factors. It’s about considering how people in leadership positions—people, in this case, who may hold the power to force employees back to the office—are possibly making a decision based on a dubious post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dubious post that used a small study, which drew on questionable definitions of “in office,” then shared by a VIP in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s not just the numbers: qualitative research can also be misleading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy—especially for those more qualitatively inclined—to sit back and judge those who take numbers at face value. &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; know it’s more complicated than that. The world can’t be whittled down to multiple choice or percentages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. This happens with qualitative data too, and the result can be even more disturbing in some ways. Certainly, people do not always understand the statistical methods used to generate certain results. Additionally, they also may not know how we &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/analysis/&quot;&gt;analyze qualitative data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, analyzing qualitative data can be (even) less transparent. The danger, then, is that people can pull out a finding and say they don’t “need” more people to validate its veracity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: Stakeholders who run with a single, qualitative data point—encouraged by an advocacy-driven researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s popular in the UX research world to keep stakeholders abreast of our ongoing research projects. I’ve heard of many researchers who post updates immediately following user interviews, for example, by providing an interesting quote from the interview and posting it in a larger internal Slack channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: A non-research stakeholder sees the quote and reposts it across the company as “proof” that “improving our information architecture is priority number one!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that study was completed, it turned out that this was an isolated comment from one interviewee, which stemmed from a misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quote, in and of itself, was highly compelling and drove interest in the research project. But the interest was misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ball had already started rolling. That quote made it to a VIP decision-making table. You know, the one where roadmaps and OKRs are planned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, of course, those people also decide whether research provided an accurate path forward—or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can researchers address these situations in the workplace?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can we, as researchers, do to encourage others to think more critically about data? This can be tricky, especially when the data being held up as “truth” comes from the mouths of leadership. Here are some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First, ensure that the data &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; present is rigorous&lt;/b&gt;. If it’s not, we need to provide the necessary caveats. Even if it is, we need to be transparent about how we collected and analyzed our quantitative &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; qualitative data and articulate the choices we made to get to the conclusions we reached. Remember: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/rigor-ux-research/&quot;&gt;There is no research without rigor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask “innocent” questions&lt;/b&gt;. Sometimes, feigning ignorance can be a good way to let someone know they might need to pay more attention to the sources they are referencing in an argument. If your Head of Product is excitedly touting a data point she heard in a recent exec meeting, find out where it came from and how relevant it is to the specific topic at hand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Educate our non-research stakeholders through collaboration&lt;/b&gt;. When we &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/research-fast-reliable-collaborative-analysis/&quot;&gt;conduct research collaboratively&lt;/a&gt; with non-researchers, we can use the opportunity to walk them through our process and our decision-making about how we choose to conduct our research. Although it can feel counterintuitive to vocalize trade-offs or doubts, it may also have the effect of increasing their awareness of the complexity of the project &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Draw inspiration from our peers&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/anatmooreville/&quot;&gt;Anat Mooreville, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; provides an excellent example of how we can approach complex data in a straightforward way with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anatmooreville_if-you-want-a-masterclass-in-how-to-turn-activity-7033865424777674752-L8ls/&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down a study examining average credit scores across the United States. She ends her post with a conclusion from which we should all draw inspiration: “Only those who are truly willing to test their hypotheses—rather than rubber stamp them—will get to these insights that change the conversation”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did bad data drive your last decision? If you’re a researcher, I hope not. But we all slip up sometimes. The good news is that, with our training, we have the tools to look more critically at our own—and our stakeholders’—choices. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The transformation of a legacy automaker: first 60 days]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/60-days-in</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/60-days-in</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This is the second article in a series. To read the first, please go &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/30-days-in/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always enjoyed watching things grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved the bean sprout experiments in biology class, and I’ve always appreciated the color and life that houseplants bring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally dedicated space in my backyard last year to growing my own garden, and I reveled in walking up and down the rows and watching the plants thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get the same kind of geeky delight when I think about my job right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I support a product team that’s responsible for the dot-com experiences of a global automotive company. The company is undergoing a multi-year transformation to create a more seamless, interconnected experience for car buyers and owners. That means they can’t outsource their designs to a bunch of agencies anymore; they’re bringing the product teams in house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I joined a team of about 50 people, and I’m their sole resource for all things UX Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have two overarching goals for our budding UX Research department:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devote time to provide UX Research insights throughout the product life cycle, &lt;i&gt;not just when it’s time to test prototypes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educate the product organization as a whole about when they might need UX Research, &lt;i&gt;because I simply can’t be everywhere at once&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 60-day mark, I’ll be honest: I don’t feel like I’ve made much progress towards these goals. But I’ve planted some seeds, and–I’ll be damned–they’ve started to sprout up out of the earth! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the initial shoots of growth and see what I’ve learned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I assembled my first report&lt;/b&gt;—a single slide summarizing a two-question survey. The project gave our global navigation product manager the confidence to move forward with a massive A/B test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the project was tiny, it ended up building a lot of goodwill with the product manager who talked me up during a weekly team call. It was an awesome message to the product team that if they’re not totally confident about the direction of something on their roadmap, maybe UX Research can help (goal number two).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each product leader also hosts a weekly meeting with their team (and usually the supporting crew is there, too—someone in analytics, project management, etc.), and I’ve been able to &lt;b&gt;share a UX Research introduction deck&lt;/b&gt; multiple times (another win for goal number two). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is tied more to the product team than to UX Research; I focus on how I help them answer the key questions &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; leaders are asking, and where in the product life cycle a UX Researcher can bring insights. It also emphasizes that they’re among my primary stakeholders, and that they don’t have to know exactly what method to apply; if they need more confidence in their approach to a solution, they can set up time to chat with me and we’ll see if UX Research can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another educational tactic I’ve continued is &lt;b&gt;sharing a research nugget each week&lt;/b&gt; in our team chat. I ran some proactive tests on the dot-com site, and I can pull a clip from those sessions in a pinch, but I also monitor the tests I’m running for my product and design teams, and I try to pull a clip for each study that showcases what UX Research can do or what can be learned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clips and infographics get a lot of emoji reactions from team members. It’s also led to follow-up questions, sometimes from senior leaders. When you’re a new resource and you want to be embedded into the product life cycle, visibility is so important! Sharing just one research nugget a week keeps the option of user research top of mind for my team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And clearly, the educational efforts are paying off. I hit a new professional record of having &lt;b&gt;twelve meetings in a single day&lt;/b&gt;, three of which were new project requests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My introverted side cringes at the memory, but part of me is absolutely thrilled that so many teams are reaching out! My product and strategy stakeholders are out there trying to solve problems, and sometimes they get a little stuck. I’ve made it clear that UX Research might help them, and they’re coming to me for help. The message is sinking in. Big wins for goal number two!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are more sluggish with goal number one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;User testing prototypes is important, of course, but that testing feels very reactive and comes towards the end of the product life cycle, when a solution is already established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my mind, a healthy UX Research discipline should also be &lt;b&gt;proactively testing what’s live today&lt;/b&gt;, through benchmarking and customer listening sessions. There should be concept testing while solutions are still being considered and mind mapping exercises to help inform solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody’s really clamoring for that, and all of my awesome outreach efforts have seriously limited the time on my calendar to design those more proactive approaches. Whoops. I’ve got to block out more time for those efforts in the next 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;b&gt;support a prototype user test&lt;/b&gt;, which the designer then analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At my last job, the UX Researchers tended to help designers during the planning phase of their tests. But then we shoved the videos at them and had them fill out a report template, and there were two big problems with that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so much work on their plate that they didn’t bother documenting the test at all, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They got so distracted by all the tiny little things users did that they lost track of the reason they were actually running the test and the reports were a laundry list of user issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this, I created a super-basic spreadsheet where literally everything about the project lives, and we fill in the test planning sections together, including instructions for the designer to complete during analysis. It threads together the original goals, the tasks/questions addressing each goal, and the eventual learnings tied to each goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a little extra work to set up, but it gives the designer some “rails” to stick to while they’re watching sessions, and it serves as documentation for what was done and what we learned, without eating up too much more of the designer’s time (or the researcher’s). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one wrinkle in this approach is that there’s no easily-digestible summary for the designer to communicate findings to his product partners. One of the longer-term product leaders clearly expected something more polished, maybe because she was used to seeing readout decks from agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’m coming in with deliverables focused on efficiency and democratization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mismatch in expectations reminded me that I need to be extra clear about end results, and that I need to remember to be flexible if the team has other expectations in mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest part about supporting an entire product organization is that I have to do a lot of context switching. The product teams are split up into five different parts of the customer journey, and each team has about five product managers, each of whom own a little slice of the experience. It’s difficult to keep track of who owns what and where they are in the users’ overall journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m also struggling to manage the incoming project requests, and I’m going to have to create a backlog of projects. I’ll have to work with partners to prioritize, and I worry about projects slipping through the cracks or my teammates deciding not to trouble me with more requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With help from our portfolio team, I’m setting up a UX Research space within our project management tool. It was originally built for the engineers, and it’s taking more time than I’d like to adapt it for my purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s up and running (hopefully by the time I start writing part three of this series), I’ll have a view of the work being done and what’s coming up next that literally anyone in our organization can check out. I can use the information to facilitate planning conversations, provide better timeline estimates, and make the case for more research team members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, I’m establishing roots and getting ready to bloom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ki Aguero, our researcher on the ground at Ford, has one final report left.

Still, those in the field can anecdotally attest that our LinkedIn feeds are full of UXR colleagues who have been impacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theory I’ve heard lately is that research is often viewed as a &lt;i&gt;nice-to-have&lt;/i&gt; rather than a critical operation. Though you can probably guess that I disagree with this sentiment philosophically, it’s important to understand where it comes from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a tech company, for example. In a recession, investors and shareholders will hound a tech company’s leadership to increase profitability, cut the fat, and ship things fast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, leadership looks at the people who produce code and UI as the primary drivers of product development. They view the ecosystem of professionals around them as secondary or tertiary, primarily because developers and designers create the final product deliverables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior manager may think, “A UX researcher is a luxury, but a developer can deliver product iterations, and I can rely on intuition to guide them. My intuition is cheaper than my researcher!” Ok, perhaps they won’t be thinking in those exact words, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I can empathize with the logic behind this way of thinking, here’s the thing: it’s misguided, and I feel pretty comfortable saying it’s a decision many companies will regret making. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UX Research deliverables are exactly what most companies need to weather a recession&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the product nerds of the internet may debate the nuances, UX research and user research are often used interchangeably, and I’ll use them that way in this article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, for those unfamiliar with the field, the term &lt;i&gt;UX research&lt;/i&gt; evokes a vision of things like usability testing or synthesis of user feedback. The term &lt;i&gt;user research &lt;/i&gt;is often perceived as vague. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the true value of user research during a recession, let’s first get on the same page about its scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usability studies are certainly within the realm of UX research, but a user research operation can, and usually does, offer a lot more. User researchers are frequently trained to use a huge variety of research methodologies, including usability studies, but also things like participatory design, in-depth user interviewing, ethnography, surveying, quantitative methods, diary studies, concept testing of new ideas, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you put the power of that robust methodology together, you have a borderline magical ability to do things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; a product experiment didn’t work as planned to inform your next iteration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know what your target audience’s biggest unanswered challenges are before your competitors do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather user sentiments about new features and ideas before you invest in their development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate fresh, new product ideas informed by the reality of your market, whether you’re looking to add more value, execute a pivot, or both&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s hardly an exhaustive list, but it’s a list of what I’d argue adds up to business superpowers. During a recession, there is an &lt;i&gt;immense&lt;/i&gt; cost to operating based on assumptions and hoping for the best. Here’s some food for thought:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both of these examples, you can see that user research allows a company to problem solve in a way that increases the likelihood that its product team will not just be &lt;i&gt;shipping fast&lt;/i&gt; but that they’ll be shipping purposefully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product team will be making product iterations, pivoting, and moving forward in a way that is in sync with its users—the people who will ultimately determine whether or not a feature, an initiative, or a full-on 180-degree change is successful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During better economic times, some company leaders may feel they have the time and space to ship, analyze, fail, and repeat until they meet their goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current climate, you’d be hard-pressed to find a leader who wouldn’t prefer to use its development, design, and other resources in a way that had more basis in the reality of its target market rather than relying on their best guesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;User research can’t precisely predict how things will perform in the real world, but it most certainly gives tangible, concrete direction in a time when we can’t just meander and raise a new round of funding every few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User research can also help teams outside of product weather a recession&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most UX researchers sit somewhere in product, but many of us work with other teams to power them with user insights that impact their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My team at Lightricks works with marketing, for example, since paid user acquisition is a huge part of our business, and things like messaging and branding really impact our bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also have experience working with our business development team when they were in the market to acquire small companies that could help us reach our business goals. My team interviewed the users of the platforms we were considering for acquisition to get insights about its value propositions, strengths, and weaknesses from a perspective beyond its user behavior data and primary KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every organization has different needs, but in general, and particularly during a recession, it’s worthwhile for leadership to think about how user perspectives and qualitative data can help with decision-making and affect the KPIs of teams outside of product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overall, user research is a source of truth that most companies can’t afford to miss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A capable, healthy user research team has its fingers on the pulse of your market, not only in numbers but also from the perspective of the human experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market data and institutional knowledge go a long way, but ultimately, any company’s ability to weather a recession will come down to whether or not they create experiences that meet the needs of &lt;i&gt;real people&lt;/i&gt;—and do it in the best, most intuitive way possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your user research team is an invaluable resource for giving direction and making sure that you do just that—for product and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Personas make a comeback? ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/personas-make-a-comeback</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/personas-make-a-comeback</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meet Christina! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She’s 175cm tall. Her favorite color is orange. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She drinks five cups of coffee in the morning and walks her dogs two times a day. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She loves reading sci-fi but finds herself watching Netflix most evenings at home. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She drives a hybrid and parks outside her garage, in the driveway.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personas have a bad rap. When they come up in conversation, usually someone gives a mocking example of some version of the above. The underlying message is: &lt;i&gt;How ridiculous. This persona has nothing to do with our actual users or our business&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s true—when poorly constructed, personas deserve the mockery they receive. Those fans of personas find this a shame because they genuinely have the potential to be a great tool for communicating user/customer insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, personas seem to be experiencing a renewed surge in interest, at least based on my LinkedIn feed. Let’s look at the current state of personas: Why did they fall out of vogue? Why are they back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why did personas fall out of vogue? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personas are meant to be archetypal characters. These characters, called “personas,” should represent different types of users/customers who interact with a product or a service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with every research artifact, their usefulness is directly tied to their actionability: Can we use these personas to make business decisions? Design decisions? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds great! So what went wrong? The nuance disappeared: Perhaps cursed by their own relatability to actual individuals, personas sometimes end up being treated more as caricatures, with exaggerations or minimizations of their original appeal: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw this happen at a company where I worked. People would refer to the personas by name in conversation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Oh, Innovation Ike would never go for that solution!”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Email Elaine would approach this situation in a totally different way.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news was that the personas had integrated themselves into company culture to the point that they were often referenced in discussion. The problem was the references were often incorrect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further complicating matters, these statements could have been relevant to the discussion had they drawn from actual data used to construct the personas. But instead, the personas had been created mainly with anecdotal evidence from customers and were used to extrapolate non-existent opinions on situations or features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even personas created with robust data might not make the cut—not because of how they were constructed, but because they weren’t adequately evangelized or updated over time as the business evolved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are personas back? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is the wrong question. Maybe instead, we should ask: Why did they ever leave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, personas are useful, if not in their literal form, at least as an example of how we can create empathy in understanding our users and customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of recent LinkedIn mentions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/efichatzopoulou_ux-uxdesign-uxresearch-activity-7024014894588923904-E0mw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;Efi Chatzopoulou&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that the debate shouldn’t be about whether or not we use personas as a tool at our companies. The discussion should rather be situated around: What are we doing to make sure we have a company-wide understanding of our users? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we reject personas as a synthesis and advocacy tool, what are we using instead? We might have found a better solution for our particular company culture. Whatever the case, let’s keep an eye on the outcome of this artifact, not the creation of a particular artifact over another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seldakoydemir_forget-what-you-know-about-personas-a-persona-activity-7026518401887956992-6VoV/&quot;&gt;Selda Koydemir&lt;/a&gt; said something similar: “A persona is one of the many ways you communicate your research insights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selda continues: “Unless your personas teach you and your stakeholders how your users make decisions or solve their problems, what motivates them, or what they are currently missing to achieve their tasks, they’re useless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know the drill, researchers: Ensure your personas accomplish their intended goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t convinced that personas had made a comeback until I started to look beyond the research community. Then I noticed a few interesting posts: Other professionals, including growth advisors and founders, are using ChatGPT to speed up the work of understanding users by asking the software to create personas based on existing data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AI-generated personas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another reason personas are top of mind: Our new fascination with the potential applications of ChatGPT, combined with the endless quest to make doing research “easier” and “faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/katya-sivkova_using-ai-for-personas-and-jtbd-research-activity-7029027173541830656-27BR/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;Katya Sivkova&lt;/a&gt; recently posted about “Using AI for your personas and Jobs to Be Done Research.” She provides a step-by-step guide to streamline the process with the help of ChatGPT. She suggested using a prompt to improve a framework she’s already considered, asking it to provide her client with clear instructions on research set-up, questions, and analysis, including grouping interview questions per topic to ease the interviewing process. Then she used Notably.ai to synthesize the resulting interview data. Finally, she returned to ChatGPT to request a “vivid” persona description. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another recent example was posted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kwadwoadu_creating-a-buyer-persona-using-chatgpt-activity-7021883916957429761-0yOu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;Kwadwo “Kocho” Swiatecki Adu&lt;/a&gt;, who used ChatGPT to create a buyer persona and ads for a fictive headphone brand. His process is fascinating to read about: Using specific prompts, he had the AI do market research into popular Generation Alpha lifestyle brands, create a table that was populated in steps by the brands, their description, their level of popularity, their annual revenue, their website, Instagram URL, and the location of their headquarters. Then he asked for a sentiment analysis of specific Instagram posts to reverse engineer the persona the company is trying to reach. This information was also generated in a table. Finally, he asked ChatGPT to create personas with descriptions and create an Instagram ad for each persona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are fascinating examples of how to use AI tools to speed up our work. But let’s keep in mind: the artifacts AI tools produce for us are only as good as the data that goes in. These examples show the tool’s power—but the power of critical thinking and sense-making remains in the researcher’s mind. This is especially true for artifacts like personas, which can have a powerful influence on how we make user and customer experience decisions at our companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The final word&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s bring back research-guided personas, absolutely! But researchers: this is your time to shine. Whether you’re creating personas from scratch or attempting to improve existing ones lacking in evidence-based creation &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; trying to produce this research artifact quicker with AI tools like ChatGPT, you have a vital role to play here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge with any research artifact is dedicating time to create, update, and advocate for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With creation, ensure the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/rigor-ux-research/&quot;&gt;rigor of your research work&lt;/a&gt;—AI tools may speed the summary of relevant text, but it needs to be checked for accuracy. Ensure the insights used to create personas are robust and the personas reflect the reality of your users. If not, they can do more harm than good. Not only could they hurt your business, but they could also damage your reputation as a researcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of updating, make sure to revisit them—your stakeholders will know they aren’t seeing an accurate representation of what’s happening today. NN/g has a great article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-are-living-documents/&quot;&gt;viewing personas as living documents&lt;/a&gt; and how to design them to evolve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, personas won’t work if they sit on a shelf after they are created. You will need to advocate for their inclusion in decision-making processes—better yet, to speed up inclusion, get your stakeholders involved from the beginning. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-personas-fail/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from NN/g about common pitfalls that cause personas to fail and how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to get started? Dr. Nick Fine recorded an excellent talk at UX Live 2018 called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_vI3AXXI-c&quot;&gt;Creating Data-Drive Personas that Perform&lt;/a&gt;, where he walks you through the process. This is an excellent place to begin if you’re ready to take on this challenge.

Depending on the situation, there are benefits that lie in democratizing your research practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had several successful experiences in startups and large corporations where I have seen the magic of everyone rallying around insights. But even I have come to understand research democratization is not suitable for every scenario. It is one of the many tools we have at our disposal, and we should use it wisely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question you might ask yourself: is research democratization right for you? Let’s have a look together at different situations and what you might be able to achieve if you were to venture down the research democratization path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your situation: first hire or team of one&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working as a solo researcher is not a great experience. It’s difficult to improve your practice without peers to discuss your research, and the workload often exceeds your capacity. This spreads you thin, forcing you to prioritize ruthlessly and say “no” too many times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re lucky, getting buy-in for new hires might be easy. But often, we find ourselves caught up in having to demonstrate the ROI of hiring more researchers. Surprisingly, this is where research democratization could prove useful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training colleagues to do user research increases the number of people who understand our practice’s value and process. Every time I train people on research, we spend a lot of time on how to define good research objectives. This knowledge, in combination with a practical understanding of usability testing, is an easy way for them to see basic user research in action. The result is often a newfound respect for user research skills and the time it takes to get good at the craft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where you win. By training colleagues, you impart an understanding of the value of research, the processes, as well as the time it takes. Knowing all this makes them your partners in crime when pleading for more resources. When the time comes to review budgets or to hire, the chances are high that you will have other disciplines vouching for more researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like magic, but there is still a large caveat. It takes time. We are often promised that democratization will free up time, allowing you to focus on the research that truly matters. Let’s burst that bubble right away: this is not a good reason to share your practice. It requires quality control processes and is extremely time-consuming if done well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancing the time and effort of democratization while maintaining sanity at work as the sole researcher is difficult. But if you enjoy teaching others, it could be the right way to go and worth your time to get buy-in to grow your team. (nb: if you want to consider a “lightweight” approach—look for designers or PMs with some research experience. They require less guidance, which can streamline the democratization process).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your situation: embedded in product team(s)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there are multiple researchers in a company, they’re often embedded in product teams. Of course, having the capacity to work like this is a fantastic way to ensure insights are gathered at all stages of product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I have noticed researchers often find themselves caught up in the everyday activities of that particular team, leaving no time to work on strategic insights that go across product boundaries or inform the company strategy. This is where research democratization can play a role in helping your company mature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people from other disciplines start doing user research, they are more inclined to understand the value and ideal timing of insights needed for strategic product development. This increased awareness is the primary benefit of sharing your practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can expect to see an increase in customer empathy among your stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced understanding of user needs among product teams &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better formulation of research questions and research requests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More allowance for big-picture thinking and strategic research that goes beyond product team silos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, research democratization can actually “free up time.” Of course, it takes some capacity to teach and guide your colleagues. But it does not have to be the responsibility of all researchers on the team. You can appoint a couple of researchers that facilitate research training and coaching. And since most product teams have had embedded researchers, the processes and application of research do not feel foreign to them. They have most likely seen you conduct research, making it a lot easier for them to learn and replicate (albeit on a more basic level than you would).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the potential downsides to this approach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every product team is willing to give up on having an embedded user researcher. Teams working with product discovery will have a tough time doing this type of research themselves. At the same time, teams going through a phase of fine-tuning and improving existing features could easily do user testing independently as long as they receive guidance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many researchers enjoy being embedded and directly impacting their product team’s work. You have to consider their needs to keep them on board in the long run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, there are significant challenges regarding insight sharing. Product teams tend to keep research outcomes to themselves, even with a process for documentation and dissemination in place. This is understandable. It takes time and effort to share findings, and it’s difficult to know what interests others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to provide active guidance around sharing insights. One solution I tried was to dedicate a researcher to a biweekly sync with the product team to discuss what they learned (insights gained) during the last sprint and what they planned to do next. That way, our researchers could stay on top of what teams were planning and make sure that they would share relevant insights with us and each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your situation: the holy grail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work for a company with high research maturity and a large team of researchers, you are lucky to have reached the holy grail. At this stage, your colleagues know when to reach out to you and how to use your insights. Your work assists both strategic and tactical product decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does democratization still have a place here? Well, there is no &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;, but you could consider a lightweight version. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me share this example to illustrate. A startup I worked in pivoted from being a Scandinavian consumer product to delivering a B2B2C product with the whole world as a potential audience. This required the staff to better understand the financial decision-making parameters outside of Sweden and Norway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team invited all our colleagues (including the C-suite) to conduct research together for a week. We recruited participants from several countries, had multiple manuscripts prepared, and allowed everyone to either interview, take notes, or observe the interviews. It was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxinsight.org/when-research-democratization-becomes-an-insights-bonanza/&quot;&gt;research bonanza&lt;/a&gt;! To our excitement, practically everyone joined. Even the CEO took notes during several interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did the staff gain from this experience? Most of all, they better understood the cultural differences of these new markets we were entering. Learning this “collectively” allowed for our product discussions to start at the same level of understanding. For us researchers, the benefit was that our colleagues understood they could learn a lot before launching the MVP. The discourse shifted from “ship and learn” to “let’s discover the true needs.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can probably argue that this experiment does not qualify as “democratization.” It’s limited in time and effort compared to a continuing process that empowers others to research. At the same time, there are company-wide benefits to this “immersive exercise” that resemble the benefits of full-blown democratization. You can count on an increased understanding of insights, more awareness of your practice, and buy-in to continue insights-informed work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bonus is that you have created an immense buzz around the activity. Everyone is part of the same discussion and has been part of similar research that week. This creates interesting conversations and a new focus on discovering potential customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side note on workplace culture, job security, and saying &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My positive experiments with democratization were in Scandinavia, where I was lucky enough to experience a work culture based on mutual trust. In Sweden, people are inclined to trust your competence, and very progressive labor laws protect employees. It was a given that my colleagues enjoyed trying new things outside their job descriptions, and I never feared for my job if one of my experiments failed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the situation is different elsewhere. In a place and space where your job is not as secure, it feels less obvious to share your practice. I have heard of examples where research democratization backfired, and people lost their jobs after training peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I have to emphasize that keeping your practice to yourself and saying no to democratization is acceptable. What are other ways to achieve buy-in for increased headcount and research maturity? You can choose to prioritize ruthlessly. Say &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; to outsourcing research and &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; to projects with limited potential. Cherry-pick the work with the highest impact and let those insights speak for you. Once people see the impact of high-quality research, stopping the demand for more is difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ready to explore between black and white? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the scenarios described above, it might be time to start exploring the gray zone yourself. The main takeaway is that if you desire to increase research maturity or headcount, democratizing your practice could be worth the time and effort. Enabling colleagues to do basic research continuously will lighten your backlog of requests in the long run. It also helps you identify the champions keen to move away from gut-based decision-making. You will gain many unexpected allies, enabling them to work insights-informed and have a lot of fun along the way. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bad data and decisions ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/bad-data-and-decisions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/bad-data-and-decisions</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The transformation of a legacy automaker: first 30 days]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/30-days-in</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/30-days-in</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Everyone jokes that starting a new job is like drinking from a fire hose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first few weeks and months are jam-packed with new information: company culture and policies, common acronyms, new coworkers. You have to study org charts and trace paths from direct reports to managers to &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; managers to understand how your organization works. There’s hardware and software to set up and, often, a new industry and customer base to understand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In technology, you’re also introduced to new product areas or breakdowns. Agile vs waterfall vs everything in between. New project management tracking systems, design and research platforms, and all the structure, rules, and processes that go alongside those tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’m sitting here reflecting on my first 30 days as UX Research Lead at an international automotive company, and it doesn’t feel like I’ve been drinking from a fire hose. It feels more like spring rains just before everything explodes into bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, vehicle manufacturing companies don’t usually have an internal team handling their dot-com experiences. They hire out to an agency (or, more often, multiple agencies) to create brochure-style websites. Those websites might cover the basic vehicle specs and get you excited about owning one of their latest models, but that’s historically been the end of the journey. A hopeful car owner would then head to their local dealership and sort out their future ride in person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only…not all customers want that. Some people love to haggle and negotiate in person while it makes others uncomfortable. Between the COVID-19 pandemic and the convenience of online car-buying experiences like Carmax or Carvana, people are getting more comfortable with the idea of taking their car-buying experience digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So automakers like my new employer are bringing product teams in-house. Over the next year, our team is adopting site experiences across multiple domains previously owned or supported by multiple agencies. We have two central missions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streamline their entire dot-com experience to make it seamless and interconnected, from initial car shopping to vehicle ownership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay competitive in the twenty-first century, enable customers to purchase a vehicle through the company’s website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why does joining this team feel less like drinking from the proverbial fire hose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there are no processes defined. No “we do it this way” or consistent method of writing a user story, estimating team capacity, measuring effectiveness, et cetera. How do we want our product team to operate? What’s the site’s tone and voice? What components are we going to use? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody really knows the answers to these questions right now. Most of the team is in the first few weeks or months of joining. We’re still transferring site designs and tons of other resources from agencies, and we don’t necessarily have to stick to what they’ve been working on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s blue skies right now. The team is brimming with energy and potential, and we have the support of leadership to decide for ourselves what an effective process will look like. We’re soaking everything in and getting ready to shoot up out of the ground and transform one of the last, worst customer experiences: buying a car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;__________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that’s the big picture. Now let’s focus on my role in this massive transformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the only product team member specializing in UX Research, it’s on me to establish that discipline internally and explain how to weave user insights into the larger product lifecycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among many other things, I’ve spent my first month learning how the product managers have divvied up their areas of responsibility–what domains they own, what part of the sales funnel they own, where their efforts end and the next product team takes over. There’s an org chart available to us, but I have also maintained a Miro org chart of my own, with additional notes—something about building it out for myself helps me forge the connections a little stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also lucky enough to join just before a quarterly product review, where each PM presented their future roadmap and capacity estimates. It was an excellent opportunity to learn names and faces, and I kept my ears open during that call for which teams might need some UXR love. Those product managers got bumped to the top of my list for one-on-one intro calls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent several hours in my first few weeks brushing up on the research platform available to me. I’ve always done most of my testing through UserTesting or a market research platform called FlexMR, but now we’ll use a different primary test platform. As someone who knows the user research basics, it was super hard to make myself watch videos about the importance of screeners, setting good objectives, and so forth—but understanding how it differs from my past research tools will be essential to keeping research projects flowing smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also spent considerable time hunting down past research and organizing it* according to product area. Agencies had some past test results to share but seemed genuinely surprised to have to share those with anyone client side (I’m sure the longer-term product managers relied on the agencies to draw their own conclusions without ever looking at results themselves). I reached out to the team that owns site feedback and got access to that platform. I connected to analysts and researchers in three different departments. I read hundreds of slides about site performance, usage trends, and KPIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it all useful? Meh, not really. I could often only assemble two or three takeaways from any given report that had any meaningful impact on how our product org might work. But hunting down what’s already known gave me an excellent baseline of the current state of our sites’ experiences, and now I know what gaps need to be filled first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remainder of my time was mostly spent doing one-on-ones with my new colleagues. I have a standard set of stakeholder introduction questions, and I rarely touch on all of the topics in one meeting, but the big question I’ve asked everyone is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“What’s your familiarity with UX Research?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most folks have brushed up against it, and most UX Designers have worked alongside UX Researchers or done research for themselves in a pinch, it’s clear to me that the discipline is a bit of a question mark. They’re not sure where it fits or how I can help. They’re unsure how often they should work with me or what the timelines will be like.**.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after my first month, I’m committing to two overarching goals for our seedling of a UX Research team:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devote time to provide UX Research insights throughout the product lifecycle, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;not just when it’s time to test prototypes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educate the product organization as a whole about when they might need UX Research &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;because I simply can’t be everywhere at once&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;___________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To impact digital products throughout the lifecycle, I will have to be loud. And to educate, I’m going to have to be persistent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve done my best to make a little noise already. In my first week, I shared a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usertesting.com/blog/ford-vs-tesla-trucks&quot;&gt;great blog post&lt;/a&gt; where UserTesting had participants compare and contrast the dot-com experiences for Tesla’s Cybertruck and Ford’s F150 Lightning. The results were a bit surprising and definitely chuckle-worthy. I posted the link in our product-wide chat room and mentioned that this was the content I hoped to provide—voices and perspectives from real humans. It got tons of reaction emojis and was referenced later in a team call, so I know the word started getting around that I’d be bringing research insights to the team going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I created an introduction deck to acclimate new team members and focused on answering the questions that kept coming up during my one-on-one meetings, such as “how do you fit into the work I’m already doing?” and “how much time is it going to take?” In the next 30 days, I’ll work on more educational content for the broader product org and plan more deep-dive training for my designers so they can advocate for UX Research when I’m not in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also plan to institute regular customer interview sessions that our entire team can attend. I know enough about our product areas and customer types to map out how often we hear from whom. My goal is to create a steady trickle of opportunities for customer &lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.uie.com/user_exposure_hours/&quot;&gt;exposure hours&lt;/a&gt;—what &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/jared-spool-democratization-research/&quot;&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt; considers the “Fast Path to a Great UX.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of program is great for establishing and maintaining empathy, of course, but it’s also a regular opportunity for everyone to lift their head up, sit back, and consider what they’re working on from a broader, interconnected perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;______________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I sound overly ambitious? Way in over my head? Or do you wonder if maybe I’m on to something? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ll do my best to check in again at the 60-day mark and let you know how things are going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, let me share a realization I had on my very first day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My welcome email included a video explaining our company’s mission. It’s about empowering people to be mobile and the company’s 100-plus years of supporting customers. Then it starts talking about the importance of transformation, with examples like Blockbuster losing out to Netflix by ignoring customer signals. My favorite line was, “When you ignore the need to change, what you’re really ignoring is the customer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to pause the video for a minute after I heard that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I finally picked my jaw up off my keyboard, I went back and took a screenshot of the graphic, which was an illustration of a woman with her back turned away from a big building with our logo on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never heard a company admit the stakes are so high to transform into a digital-first, interconnected-focused business. Most “customer first” language is nothing but lip service, something companies &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; but don’t actually have a clue how to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; an idea that the company has embraced, UX Research has the opportunity to make an amazing impact. And they hired me to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Ki’s journey as she continues to grow the UX research practice at Ford.

The question of whether, and to what extent, our colleagues who are not researchers should be doing research is something that we confront constantly and inevitably in the large majority of research roles. Do a quick search and you’ll see a variety of opinions ranging from &lt;i&gt;research belongs to researchers&lt;/i&gt; all the way to &lt;i&gt;democratizing research is the only true way to scale. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with the ongoing debate and the idea that there is a one-size-fits-all policy within our company or organization is that it ignores a lot of the nuances that define daily life as a researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lightricks, I work with a variety of stakeholders, each with different attitudes toward involvement in user research. Recently, a specific designer asked me to help them execute their own research project because they saw the ability to do so as not only interesting, but as professional skill development relevant to their field.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, on the same team, there is a product manager who would always much prefer us to do it all and ping him when we have insights and recommendations relevant to his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what I do, if I develop a strong policy about democratization at Lightricks, someone loses. Either professional development opportunities or a strong desire to interact with users in a meaningful way are lost, or we drag stakeholders into processes that they don’t feel compelled to partake in.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my answer is this: we approach democratization on an individual basis. Most researchers are comfortable with the stakeholders who say “do it and call me when you’re done” because it allows us to work in peace, utilize our skills, and do what we love. We may lament the opportunity to engage them further or the lost opportunity for increased impact, but we can usually accept it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if a stakeholder comes to us and says, “Yeah, I want to, um, interview some users about this thing I’m working on. Can you connect me with a few people?”—hell hath no fury like a researcher whose colleague implies that &lt;i&gt;anyone can do it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is it hard for researchers to let stakeholders do user research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll humanize myself by saying this: I still cringe when a stakeholder approaches me about doing their own research. If they say something like “a few users” or “something quick and dirty”—it’s often more than a cringe. Rationally, though, I understand that this is primarily an unhelpful emotional reaction driven by nothing more than my own ego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reaction makes sense on some level. It’s absolutely true researchers have a set of tangible, hard-earned skills, and it’s also true that stakeholders don’t always realize this.  Planning a research project with the proper methodology, interviewing a user, writing a survey question, analyzing a boatload of qualitative data, mitigating biases—none of these things are intuitive tasks that anyone can do without actually learning how. Yet, we’ve all had stakeholders say things to us like, “Well, I can write the interview questions or you can, whatever you want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we’re honest with ourselves, the primary reason we roll our eyes when a stakeholder approaches us (or, worse, doesn’t approach us) about doing research on their own is because, well, it’s insulting. Here’s the thing: we do our research practices a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; favor by taking a deep breath and letting it roll off of our shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adopt the mindset of a research multiplier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multiplier, in this case, is what I define as a researcher who exponentially increases the quantity of research and the impact of user perspectives at their organization by getting over themselves. It means that if we meet stakeholders where they are and choose to teach &lt;i&gt;research skills&lt;/i&gt; over passive aggressively asserting that we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; skills in the first place, everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a designer or a product manager approaches you about “talking to users” or “writing a quick survey” with a degree of enthusiasm to do it themselves or to be heavily involved, your response as a research multiplier should be encouraging.  Offer to do a few sessions about conducting proper interviews and attend their first few to offer feedback and help them improve. Direct them to resources about survey best practices and offer to review their questions and host an analysis session when the results roll in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a stakeholder’s skill level is unlikely to match yours after a few experiences like this, they can make a ton of progress over time if you’re committed to teaching over eye-rolling.  Three important things happen when this is your policy: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You increase your research resources if you have stakeholders that you can trust to do all or part of research processes, even if that takes time &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You create advocates out of stakeholders: no one evangelizes research more effectively than a stakeholder who starts to dip their toes into the wonderful world of user insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You establish yourself and your team as a group of people with skills to teach. Stakeholders who learn from you tell your colleagues things like, “Interviewing is much more of a science than I’d thought. I’m learning with so-and-so on the user research team and it’s been really valuable.”  Chances are, you’ll have more stakeholders knocking on your door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As advocates for our users, multiplying our evangelists and bottom line resources within our organizations is a huge investment in being able to do more research and have more impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Embrace the mess&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a previous company that I worked for, I was told by the CEO that a bunch of senior managers were going to participate in the next face-to-face user research project I was planning.  I wasn’t particularly excited but I rolled up my sleeves because in that case, I really didn’t have a choice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dutifully conducted training sessions, went over our plans a million times, and answered any and all questions leading up to the actual project where we would spend two intensive days conducting both participatory design sessions and individual interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the day arrived, I had a group of enthusiastic participants with varying success. I winced when I heard questions being asked improperly or any other trespass on best practices but overall, I managed to lean into the experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What ended up happening is that while yes, some data had to be thrown out because of poor collection practices—not all of it did. I offered real-time feedback and things got better by the hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it have been easier to execute that day with trained user researchers at my side? Definitely. But what I gained were senior managers who were newly passionate about the value of user insights in strategic decision-making. That did more for our practice in the long run than &lt;i&gt;just doing a good job&lt;/i&gt; on my own would have done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you involve stakeholders without much research experience, there will be hiccups.  It will almost always still be worth your while in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don’t let your ego block long-term gains &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If stakeholders aren’t interested in being involved in the nuts and bolts of research, don’t force them. Without their genuine interest, it’s almost certain that you and your team will do a better job. But when a colleague approaches you about doing research on their own, however cluelessly—you and your whole organization benefit from meeting them where they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they don’t know that what they want to do requires knowledge and skill, show them. If they are unaware of the science behind planning a research project that delivers reliable results, explain it and let them practice. If they think they already know how, let them try and offer feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers who are relentlessly pursuing the integration of user voice across our organizations, surely we can bite our tongues when we feel that our skill sets are misunderstood or unacknowledged for the sake of multiplying research advocates and resources in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The pitfalls of continuous discovery research (and how to avoid them)]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-pitfalls-of-continuous-discovery</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-pitfalls-of-continuous-discovery</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Though the concept of continuous discovery research isn’t new in the world of product development, it’s safe to say it’s &lt;i&gt;having a moment&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I’ve been inundated with requests for “talking to a user every week” or “just getting feedback on an ongoing basis” from product team members. I’ve also heard similar sentiments from other researchers at different companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why? And is it a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is continuous discovery research, and why is it so popular right now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous discovery research is the consistent, regular seeking of user insights and feedback using frequent, short research methodologies that are analyzed over time. 

In organizations with less UX maturity or less experience working with proper user research methodology, the requests are often articulated as though they’re casual. For example, a product manager might ask to interview (or the dreaded “talk to”) a power user once a week, or perhaps a designer will want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/triangulate-data/&quot;&gt;triangulate user behavior data&lt;/a&gt; with support tickets with reports created weekly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, continuous discovery is attractive to stakeholders. It’s a consistent flow of feedback on what they’re building, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;, from their perspective, it involves getting insights within shorter timelines than with project-based research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on personal experience and anecdotes from colleagues, I’ve also felt that it’s appealing because it’s perceived as casual. Stakeholders don’t always feel they need specific research skills to do it themselves or help speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the current uptick in requests for continuous discovery research, it’s impossible to know why it’s happening, but the current economic climate offers a reasonable hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the tech industry as an example. A company aggressively reducing expenses may see user research as a &lt;i&gt;nice-to-have&lt;/i&gt; more than a mission-critical activity (though many of us would probably disagree). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, many companies reduce their research teams and budgets during the downturn. This creates a situation where either stakeholders are tasked with doing research without dedicated researchers or a much smaller team with a limited budget is trying to answer everyone’s research needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, continuous discovery can be attractive because its rhythm is predictable, expenses can easily be limited, and insights are constantly coming in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fair enough—continuous discovery research is a potent piece of a comprehensive research operation that offers real, timely value. That being said, there are potential pitfalls when it takes precedence over or completely replaces other forms of user research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential pitfalls to avoid when prioritizing continuous discovery research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is a misconception that continuous discovery research doesn’t require actual analysis methodology and that every user touch point offers actionable insights; this can lead to misleading results and poor decision-making. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though continuous discovery research doesn’t necessarily have a specific endpoint, it’s important to ensure stakeholders understand the need for scrupulous analysis. Some stakeholders may have experience with this methodology, but for those who don’t, you want to ensure they understand the proper way to analyze continuous discovery data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you, as a researcher, will be conducting the research, you can ensure you’re on the same page about the frequency of insights output and how you’ll prioritize different insights and action items over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If stakeholders themselves will be doing the research, you should offer some education about the basic best practices when it comes to continuous discovery. Even if your stakeholders have experience reviewing survey data, conducting interviews, and so on, they could use a quick lesson about how and when to analyze this type of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Products change over time, and research without a specific timeline may generate data from users experiencing your product differently. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When conducting continuous discovery, you or your stakeholders will uncover a lot of sentiments and pain points. In most organizations, product iterations happen over time. So a crucial part of analyzing the data is looking at it in the context of product updates and learning how they have (or have not) affected what you’re learning from users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have a product pain point disappear, become less prominent, or have a new one emerge when introducing a new feature. Someone must carefully analyze continuous discovery data needs in tandem with product updates. If it is, the ability to look at how user feedback and insights evolve is one of the main perks of continuous discovery!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuous discovery research usually prioritizes current users. If it’s the only type of research being done, key strategic research opportunities may be missed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my team at Lightricks, whether a stakeholder asks for it explicitly or not, we generally take every opportunity possible to include research participants both from our current &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; outside our user base. For example, you can gather highly actionable insights from people who use your competitors’ products and try yours for the first time or people who are members of your target audience but haven’t used your product yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous discovery research in many organizations needs to address these types of insights. When whoever is doing research is &lt;i&gt;only &lt;/i&gt;looking at current users, there are likely some important, strategic perspectives left on the table. Make sure you advocate for time and resources outside of continuous discovery within your user base so that your product team doesn’t miss out on potentially impactful perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you fall into a continuous research rut—asking the same general questions repeatedly—you may leave nitty gritty, detailed user-based insights unexplored.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since continuous discovery tends to happen at a typical cadence without a defined endpoint, sometimes the upkeep of things like an interview guide or the metrics you’re triangulating stays the same for too long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals, perspectives, and internal product initiatives change pretty consistently within most organizations, and continuous discovery requires a certain level of upkeep to ensure that you’re not failing to investigate what’s important &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what’s a good way to meet the demand for continuous discovery research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand for continuous discovery shows a genuine desire to learn more about users and to incorporate their perspectives into product development. When done correctly, it yields tremendously powerful product insights. For these reasons, I’m an advocate for making it happen. At Lightricks, I’ve had my own failures and wins when meeting continuous discovery demands, and this is my go-to list of what I’ve found to work well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t say no to continuous discovery, but advocate for additional strategic research&lt;/b&gt;. The best way to do this is to understand the crux of stakeholder questions and propose corresponding research. For example, suppose a product manager wants to interview power users of a certain feature set on an ongoing basis. In that case, you may suggest a more in-depth parallel project that looks at users using similar feature sets to your competitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create continuous research sprints so that everyone is aligned around timelines and expectations. &lt;/b&gt;I’ve found that using a &lt;i&gt;sprint &lt;/i&gt;framework for continuous discovery uses language that stakeholders are familiar with and does a good job of setting natural expectations. For example, my team did monthly usability sprints for some of our products at Lightricks. This meant stakeholders knew to expect monthly deliverables with insights and usability recommendations every month. The month-long framework meant we looked at each data set within the context of the product changes we implemented that particular month. You can use a sprint framework if you’re conducting the research or suggest it to stakeholders executing continuous discovery independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set periodic reminders to analyze data sets, update interview guides, and review which metrics you’re looking at. &lt;/b&gt;Whether you or your stakeholders are conducting continuous discovery research, set periodic reminders to review your materials. For example, if you’re interviewing users, are you asking all the questions relevant to your company’s work &lt;i&gt;right now?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous discovery research generates insights with the added benefit of looking at user perspectives over time, and it’s a great addition to any research operation, big or small. Though economic or other factors may be influencing its current popularity, it’s unlikely to go anywhere anytime soon, and it’s well worth the time of any researcher or product professional to think about how to use it at their organization according to best practices. Over time, your stakeholders might even stop calling user interviews’ &lt;i&gt;talking to users’&lt;/i&gt; and warm up to the rigor required to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What should we do about UX bootcamps?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/ux-bootcamps</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/ux-bootcamps</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore a pragmatic perspective on bootcamps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bootcamps are filling a gap in training requirements for UXRs. Until we have more robust and clear requirements for what “makes” a UXR, bootcamps have their place.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you gasp in shock or blink in surprise? I can believe it because what I hear more often is: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Bootcamps are destroying our profession!” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I’ve read some version of that statement nearly every day on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: Most UX bootcamps are primarily design-focused and only contain basic research training. There are research-focused bootcamps as well, and although the vitriol I’ve read covers both types of bootcamps, I’m focusing on boot camps attracting UX researchers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at this topic from a couple of different perspectives because the negative rhetoric goes further than critiquing the existence of boot camps themselves. It seems to take the following progression: Bootcamps are harmful to the profession, AND the people who attend bootcamps are unqualified to work as UX researchers. Let’s discuss each of these in turn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bootcamps are harmful to the profession of UX research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arguments are: The content of bootcamps does not address realistic scenarios to train researchers. The material is mainly theoretical and divorced from real-world scenarios that researchers would encounter in an in-house role. Plus: the bootcamps are marketing unrealistic expectations of graduates’ employability in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The people who attend bootcamps are unqualified (and therefore harmful to the profession)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, a bootcamp on a resume is actually a detriment to their employability: Although this person is new to UX research, their naivete in choosing to invest in a bootcamp means they are also unfit for the profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a pragmatic view of this topic and unpack the criticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bootcamps are harming the profession, yet…employers aren’t asking for bootcamp experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bootcamps are only harmful if people are hiring UX research bootcampers, right? People who hire UX researchers are often not familiar with the field as they are not researchers themselves. They might assume a bootcamp-prepared researcher is ready to hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, the harm is multi-generational: bootcamps create professionals who think bootcamps prepared them for the workplace; those people get promoted and are now hiring new bootcamp graduates to staff their teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this really a widespread problem? The answer is, tentatively, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawton Pybus’s excellent newsletter, The ¼” Hole, published a newsletter last fall on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quarterinchhole.com/p/what-employers-want-from-uxr-candidates?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=613172&amp;post_id=77869741&amp;isFreemail=true&quot;&gt;What employers want from UXR candidates&lt;/a&gt;, where he dives into what’s explicitly stated in job descriptions and what isn’t. He tracked the UX researcher job market since July 2021, using Indeed.com search terms and filters, and analyzed 22,425 job descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did he find? Most roles don’t require advanced degrees, and educational requirements have been trending downward since he first started his observations in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portfolio requirements are also down in the past one and a half years, with 22.5 percent of jobs requiring them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of tech tools is often a requirement—he found the most commonly mentioned in UX researcher job descriptions were Figma, UserTesting, Qualtrics, UserZoom, and Miro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did he not find? A plethora of bootcamp requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Lawton to comment on the presence of bootcamps in his data. His reply:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Bootcamps didn’t show up reliably from month to month in my data, but I had a note somewhere to revisit this since I wonder if I’m just using the wrong keywords. For example, ‘bootcamp’ and ‘boot camp’ show few or no results, but ‘certification’ shows a few more (although that can appear for multiple reasons). My suspicion is employers don’t care about bootcamps, per se. They’re looking for experience with UX research methods on realistic projects, and bootcamps can be a path to that.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all like to say, more research is needed! But we can say that a “bootcamp” is certainly not taking over other requirements deemed important to succeed in UX research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What it’s like from the outside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that long ago, I was on the outside. I’m one of those career pivoters, coming into UXR after a long academic career. I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7008411090564825088/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn confession&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago: When I was trying to land my first UX research job, I did a bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a bootcamp because it seemed that recruiters and hiring managers could only see my PhD and 15 years of academic research experience as a liability. I could not find any formal educational path to “become” a UX researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did a bootcamp because no one would hire me without “experience.” And guess what? The person who hired me for my first UX research job said that the credential on my resume showed I was serious about the career pivot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shared this story in defense of my own insecurity. I tried many avenues to get into the world of UX research, one of which was participating in a bootcamp. Research bootcamps were practically non-existent back then. The one I chose was in UX Design, and it did give me an idea of the UX design process and, most importantly, how I would collaborate with others once I was in an in-house role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bootcamps undermine the hard work UXR professionals have done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the elephant in the room: at the end of the day, bootcamps undermine the hard work done by UXR professionals. People spent years building their careers, and now someone is telling aspiring UX researchers that it takes just a couple of months to be job ready. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to realize this. My past career was in academia, where the lines of qualification are very clearly drawn. To be an Assistant Professor, you have to have a PhD. There is no PhD bootcamp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of UX research education&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bootcamp hater or not, we all have to agree: &lt;i&gt;Bootcamps are filling a gap in the profession.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s a lot to choose from: I did a google search for “UX research bootcamp” (in quotes). My search returned 969 results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also googled “UX research training” (8,070 results) and “UX research degree” (2,000 results). So, there are some options out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;quick question: If you were looking to enter a new profession and were still clueless about the lingo or culture of that profession, what would you google? How would you start your quest to get in?&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will have this discussion until there are widespread UX research degrees and the industry agrees that such a degree prepares one to dive into professional life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it won’t be a university degree. Who, then, is offering the education? Is it a university, a private company, or a consultant? Does this matter to the legitimacy we grant the training? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bootcamps have their place. Let’s work together to find it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll end with an example from my own career:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to 2008, while doing my PhD research, I taught a bootcamp. A crash course, really. It was called “Crash Course—Introduction to Research Methodology.” The course was created because the university I taught at noticed that many of their master’s degree applicants had strong academic backgrounds save for one important thing: Their previous education hadn’t afforded them rigorous research design training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the master’s degrees culminated in researching and writing a master’s thesis, students needed to have a basis for understanding how empirical research was conducted. Our three-week “bootcamp” course taught them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how to design research projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become acquainted with different methods of data collection, processing, and analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to understand and critically assess the value, reliability, and meaning of published research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three summer weeks before the academic year began, we welcomed a roomful of master’s students and attempted to get them up to speed so they could successfully complete their programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course came into existence because the institution granting the degree realized there was a gap between their requirements and the skill set of the students they wanted to admit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the class worked: Students were thrilled with what they learned. We’d hear year-round from former students about how our instruction helped them understand academic articles, join classroom discussions, and, most importantly, conduct empirical research for their master’s degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until a profession has a clear-cut path to legitimate training, these shades of gray will always exist. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI is changing research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-ai-is-changing-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-ai-is-changing-research</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the capabilities of technology like ChatGPT, concern for one&amp;#39;s future employment is a fair response.

While these help organizations develop solutions to usability problems, UX research can do much more once it reaches &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/uxr-maturity/&quot;&gt;higher levels of maturity&lt;/a&gt; in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By “higher levels of UX research maturity,” I mean reaching the level where you start doing strategic UX research activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this category, we’re thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/customer-journey-map&quot;&gt;customer journey and experience mapping,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deliverableux.com/ux-guide-to-mental-models&quot;&gt;mental model diagrams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/&quot;&gt;service blueprints&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/&quot;&gt;card sorts&lt;/a&gt;. The one thing these activities have in common is that they all help better identify problems and customers’ mental models before you start designing solutions. That’s because they mostly happen in the problem space or the first “diamond” in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/skills-learning/tools-frameworks/framework-for-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond/&quot;&gt;double-diamond model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These activities tend to be planned rather than reactive, which is why they are considered “strategic” (see more about the definition in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/videos/strategic-reactionary-user-research/&quot;&gt;Nielsen Norman Group’s video&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many approaches to consider when it comes to strategic UX research. The range goes from one strategic UX researcher in a small organization to a dedicated team for strategic research activities in larger corporations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that whoever conducts this research should be free from working in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebatman.com/a-typical-2-week-sprint-calendar-60304478651b&quot;&gt;two-to-three-week sprint cadences&lt;/a&gt; typical of software development. Strategic research activities require a different pace and aren’t geared towards delivering features on apps and websites but towards identifying pain points and mental models that can later guide design direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of repurposing one or some of your existing UX research resources to let them focus on strategic UX research instead of evaluative research, here’s what you should know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff between strategic and evaluative UX research is simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic research takes longer than evaluative research. Still, it can yield insights across multiple squads and product lines that help with better decision-making at a higher level beyond quick UI fixes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into a few of the many reasons why it is important for any organization to invest in strategic UX research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategic UX research helps in times of uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The only constant in life is change” - Heraclitus, ancient Greek philosopher (~ 500 BC).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past few years have been filled with rapid and extreme changes and events, from the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, higher level of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/04/ecommerce-sales-surged-during-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;e-commerce adoption&lt;/a&gt;, remote/hybrid work,  and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/advisor/ca/investing/why-is-inflation-rising-right-now/&quot;&gt;unprecedented levels of inflation&lt;/a&gt; around the world, potentially leading to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/why-everyone-thinks-a-recession-is-coming-in-2023.html&quot;&gt;recession in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic UX research can’t help you predict radical changes but can help better adjust your course of action while you’re thinking of designing for a future state. The main reason is that strategic UX research practitioners triangulate data from different sources, which can help better understand shifts in mental models and experiences. This helps you identify and understand the impact of various trends on your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of how strategic UX researchers triangulate data from multiple sources to help businesses in uncertain times:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;b&gt;customer journey mapping exercises&lt;/b&gt; after major world changes to assess the impact on your customers’ interactions with your products and services to reveal new pain points. For example, consider how trends like remote work or high levels of inflation affect customer behaviors &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Card sort exercise and in-depth interviews &lt;/b&gt;to assess how mental models have evolved after some of the past years’ changes (e.g., buying things online, spending more time online, rising prices of housing, etc.). These activities show the potential impact of major events on your business. Mental model diagrams are a good way to represent these changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-referencing &lt;b&gt;live quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/b&gt; with secondary data sources (i.e., industry reports, competitive intelligence, etc.) to see if the trends observed reflect a larger &lt;b&gt;industry-wide trend&lt;/b&gt; and how some of your competitors deal with it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more proactive view on the future, your strategic UX research team can branch out into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/what-strategic-foresight&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;strategic foresight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to actively observe how the changes they see now impact business in the longer run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a wide range of options to choose from, but understanding the potential of strategic UX research to help deal with uncertain futures at the strategic level is one of the strongest arguments for building this capacity in-house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategic UX research helps UX and CX teams see better returns on their efforts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/publications/infonomics&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Infonomics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; Douglas Laney writes about situations where certain kinds of information can generate high ROI. Generally speaking, many apply to UX research activities, as well as quantitative/big data initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first area and the most obvious one would be &lt;b&gt;cost saving&lt;/b&gt;. Strategic UX research can help your organization understand main customer pain points and what they mean beyond pure numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long wait times on the phone for your customer service representatives? Clutter of information on the website that prevents your customers from completing actions online? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all common and costly situations for organizations. One of the places where these problems manifest is in live data or comments coming from a feedback stream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality behind the scenes and why it matters to your customers is something you can only uncover by doing strategic UX activities. Talking to customers and mapping trends based on qualitative data gives quantitative data useful context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know many engineering-led organizations like big numbers, but they aren’t worth a lot on their own. The context from interviewing people (both customers and employees) allows you to understand the “why” beyond pain points, leading to solutions that support your customers and reduce costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service blueprints help you dig into your organization to understand areas causing customer friction. This provides a view of how to work around sources of customer pain by redesigning parts of your service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second way information can lead to better ROI is by discovering the potential for &lt;b&gt;new revenue-generating business opportunities. &lt;/b&gt;Strategic UX research can definitely help here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer journey and experience maps are great ways to discover areas of the customer experience that can be improved by introducing new products and features that can solve particular problems. You can map this experience across multiple product lines, with a wide impact across a few teams.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you frame these products and features as new business opportunities, you start to see why such activities can lead to better ROI on UX design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last area I’d like to talk about is &lt;b&gt;better&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;business decision-making&lt;/b&gt;. Sometimes you’d like to introduce new features into a website or app, but you’re unsure where or in what format to place the UI. This is an area where strategic UX research can help in the solution space rather than the problem space by rapid prototyping and testing potential new additions for desirability and not just usability. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gv.com/sprint/&quot;&gt;Google Design Sprint&lt;/a&gt; method is fantastic for this and will get you making decisions within a week or two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategic UX research is agile, but requires a different cadence of work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many engineering-led organizations, “agile” refers to two-to-three-week sprint cycles. This cadence can work well for evaluative research like short usability tests. However, this cadence doesn’t work well for larger, in-depth strategic UX research projects. For instance, read this article from the Nielsen Norman Group to learn how much &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-map-how-much-time/&quot;&gt;time it takes to create a customer journey map.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That still doesn’t mean strategic UX research isn’t agile! You have to remember that the cadence is different. I’d recommend taking one-to-two big questions per quarter and running two-to-three research activities to find evidence and insights that can help the organization plan design and business activities in the following quarter based on the roadmap of your product stakeholders. This way, your strategic UX research activities do not delay anyone’s work but can still be scoped and relevant when your team delivers the insights your stakeholders need to act upon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make strategic UX research part of your practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many organizations still underutilize UX research by only focusing on the present and near-future evaluation of their UIs. According to the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userinterviews.com/state-of-user-research-2022-report&quot;&gt; 2022 survey by User Interviews&lt;/a&gt;, interviews and usability tests are still the most common research methods among UX researchers, an indication most UX research activities are still at the basic level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic UX research is where your organization can take a step back and answer bigger questions such as “Are we solving the right problem?” or “If our biggest competitor created feature X, does that mean that we absolutely must offer the same feature?”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many organizations try to answer these questions by developing products and features and trying to see if people will use them. While this approach can work for certain situations, changing the approach and adopting strategic UX research can help to better identify the right problems to solve for your customers. It allows you to think broadly about your holistic design and business strategy and answer high-leverage questions.

It’s enough to make your head spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got my first introduction to the world of B2B nine years ago in a university class I taught. We paired students with a large B2B enterprise company and challenged the students to create a social media marketing campaign for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students had a lot of questions. What exactly was B2B? To whom were we supposed to market the products: The companies that bought the products? Or the end consumers who used the products? No one seemed able to answer this question, including the company themselves. It was a confusing time, and I told myself I would avoid B2B work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward six years, my first UX research role was to lead the practice at a B2B company, which—similar to that giant enterprise company—was somewhat confused about who their users were. They also had a 400-plus workforce and had never worked with researchers before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s setting the stage. Now let’s talk about what happens after you’ve got the job and started your first research project. That moment when you realize you have to actually conduct research. And the practicalities start creeping in. Tasks and challenges emerge, like: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating an interview guide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a deck to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-create-a-powerful-research-presentation/&quot;&gt;present findings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting software to record, transcribe, and code interviews &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Getting software&lt;/a&gt; to analyze data and share insights &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/recruiting-participants-user-research/&quot;&gt;Finding participants&lt;/a&gt; to interview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process of actually conducting a research project led to my first lesson:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson one: We’re going to need a system to make all this research happen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it sounds so obvious. But it wasn’t a task I had envisioned for myself. I had imagined my first UX research role in an established company would entail churning out usability tests for a couple of years until I earned my stripes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve learned that despite all the press and attention FAANG/MAMAA companies get in the UX research community, most organizations aren’t high in research maturity. A lot are just starting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they’ve never done research, they certainly won’t have systems to facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a system wasn’t just about running through the checklist above. Because research projects were—in the best-case scenario—going to be set on repeat. As our team grew, we could bring more and more insights to the table. We couldn’t possibly do all of this &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we created a checklist of what we would need, from proper consent forms to best practices for insights sharing. We created a file system to keep our materials organized and accessible to others. We crafted research project artifacts like consent forms and interview guide templates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were things that we could do solo. But we quickly realized: there were many things we couldn’t do alone. In some cases, we needed budget approval from our manager or other budget holders, and some tasks required cooperation with other people at the company. That led me to lesson number two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson two: Our operational structure should not and cannot grow in isolation from the rest of the company&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful researchers cannot work alone—that was clear. But it was more than simply introducing ourselves to others or “getting to know” our colleagues. Two things became quickly apparent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We would need money&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We would need to build well-functioning, productive relationships and collaborations&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll come back to budget in lesson three. First, let’s talk about collaboration. To succeed, research needs more than skilled researchers. It requires fruitful cross-disciplinary cooperation. I’m not only talking about the obvious collaborators like designers, data analysts, or product managers. The collaboration I’m thinking about must take place with people in teams you probably haven’t even met yet: sales, marketing, and the all-important Customer Success Managers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why CSMs? I have three words for you: Research participant recruitment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long to realize: CSMs would need to become our BFFs. If not our BFFs, at least enthusiastic enough about our work to share the potential value with their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSMs are experts on individual customers—in the B2B case, they know particular companies’ pain points and needs inside and out. From the researcher’s perspective, because CSMs know these customers so well, they are often the best bet to connect customers with user researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember all that confusion about customers and who actually uses the product? CSMs have a lot of insight into this process. Because they’ve built close relationships with customers, they have, in a sense, been conducting ethnographic case study research for as long as they’ve worked with that particular customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we figured this out and built these important relationships, things started running smoothly. But if a UX research job has taught me anything, the learning never stops. That leads me to Lesson number three: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson three: Getting buy-in for research operations isn’t the same as getting buy-in for researchers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting buy-in to expand your research team, as in hiring expert researchers, is a massive exercise in stakeholder management. I’ve written several articles on this topic, for example, about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/honoring-non-research-perspective/&quot;&gt;honoring the non-research perspective&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-low-ux-maturity-organization/&quot;&gt;approaching research in a low-maturity organization&lt;/a&gt;. It’s essential, especially as demand for research increases, that you grow your capacity to conduct and provide expert support for your company’s research needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However: Those same individuals you need to approach and convince to open up headcount for their “own” researcher or a researcher who will support a product or topic close to their heart may not be as keen to financially support an operational budget that serves the entire company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice? Figure out who holds the purse strings. It might be your manager, your manager’s manager, or someone else. Find out who this is and what they best respond to. Learn about the history of approvals, especially for new functions like research. If it’s your manager’s manager, don’t go over your manager’s head and talk to this person. Work together to come up with the best approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gotten that first, all-important approval—maybe a subscription to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;platform for qualitative analysis&lt;/a&gt; or a digital diary study tool—it’s time to sing their praises. Praise this person when you’re demonstrating how much smoother your research projects are running, thanks to their generous support. Everyone likes to be the hero, even if it’s just signing approval for something as mundane as AI interview transcription software.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s take a step back. Even with that person’s approval, it’s not necessarily smooth. In my experience, it wasn’t because the budget holder was unwilling to provide us with the tools necessary to build a thriving practice—although that could be your situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem came in procurement. Imagine signing up for an enterprise account with a research repository platform. You check the box, and they give you unlimited access. You send the bill to your procurement department and assume it’s being taken care of. In the meantime, you’re onboarding researchers and learning how to use the tool. You’re storing interview transcripts and analyzing the results. Then, one day, the lights go off—no more access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out our procurement department didn’t honor 30-day payment periods, only 90-day. Time went on, and they don’t honor 90-day periods, either. It could happen to you, too: the platform you’ve signed up for—rightly so—has gotten fed up with not getting paid and has cut you off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice? Make it an early priority to sort out what you’ll need to get your research operations up and running. Especially from a tooling perspective, get those requests in after you’ve built that all-important budget-approving relationship. Depending on your company, it could take months until you’re able to utilize these investments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being the first researcher at any company is a huge, exciting, and humbling experience. You’ll laugh, cry, and learn a ton along the way. Although it’s a lot of work, watching your efforts slowly transform a company’s mindset toward research insights will make it all worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rigor and research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/rigor-and-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/rigor-and-research</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rigor is not something one can turn &lt;u&gt;off and on like a light switch&lt;/u&gt; and still have research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is product a UX rival or partner?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/rival-or-partner</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/rival-or-partner</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Venus and Serena. Tom and Jerry. FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do these individuals, characters, and football teams have in common? When they meet, whether it’s on the tennis court, in an animated short film, or on the football pitch, their—and our—emotions are heightened because of their well-publicized rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Oxford Language Dictionary, a rival is “a person or thing competing with another for the same objective or for superiority in the same field of activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX research and product. Are we rivals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break that down a bit more. Are we &lt;i&gt;competing for the same thing&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the tasks that make up our work roles, the answer is: yes, we are in competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rivals compete for the same thing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rivalry is well illustrated by a 2021 Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) article entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-product-managers-overlap/&quot;&gt;UXers and Product Managers Both Say Others Intrude on Their Work&lt;/a&gt; (part two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pm-ux-different-views-of-responsibilities/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). They asked their respondents questions stemming from the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do other roles overstep on the work of PM and UX, and, if so, how often? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which roles overlap with PM and UX? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does duplicative work happen? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the effects of work overlap? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who do PM and UX think is responsible for which activities and deliverables? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who holds the power at the organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the survey with UXers and PMs (372 responses) provide evidence that UX and product are often duplicating work. The survey found that role overlap is common, and overlap is particularly pronounced according to UXers. Further, UXers feel the job overlap results in a negative impact—and this perception is significantly more pronounced for UXers than for PMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus on research practice in particular. The NN/g survey asked respondents about three research tasks: discoveries, user interviews, and user testing. For all three tasks, PMs and UXers differed significantly in the extent to which they assigned them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, 19 percent of PMs said discovery was UX’s job, and 73 percent of UXers thought it was their job. Less than half (46 percent) of PMs thought it was UX’s job to perform user testing, while 88 percent of UXers wanted this responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These views extend beyond who does the task to which topic should be researched: “Deciding which areas the UX team will research was the clearest example of appropriation: UXers thought UX should do it and PMs thought that PM should do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t sound great, does it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait. Let’s back up for a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this NN/g survey representative of what’s happening at your workplace? Maybe. But maybe not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Company roles are not equal to roles held by a global discipline &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a UX researcher starting a new role, did you have any assumptions on your first day? For example, that you were going to clash with PMs or POs? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did you feel when you were reading the results of the survey above? A bit disturbed? Anxious? (Especially about how one of the largest sources of conflict relates to research tasks?). Maybe I’m assuming here, but I see researchers talk about this conflict all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with Venus and Serena, Tom and Jerry, FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, the rivalry between research and product is often discussed. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/manomano-tech/should-product-managers-do-user-research-37ff02ed2306&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/i-sat-down-with-a-bunch-of-product-managers-for-a-conversation-b04a8089cf43&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/ux-researchers-and-product-managers-a-guide-to-effective-collaboration-90357c7a9adf#:~:text=UXR%20advocates%20for%20what%20will,product%20successful%20in%20the%20market.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, please remember that this survey does not look at relationships between PMs and UXers within a particular organization. They are looking at respondents from a variety of organizations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey takes PMs and UXers from companies who most likely have different approaches to product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a UXer who answers adamantly that research is their task may have a conflict-free situation at their work. This could be exactly true for a PM who conducts research as part of their job at another organization that doesn’t have researchers. Because this survey looks at global answers, the responses do not confirm or articulate an internal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal is not to pick on the NN/g survey. Rather it’s a great example of why it’s important to be aware of the pitfalls of industry-wide research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t assume a specific rivalry with product before you even get started. Instead, do in-house research to learn more about your company’s culture and ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From rivals to partners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Partner” is an antonym for rival. According to the same dictionary: “either of a pair of people engaged together in the same activity” but also “any of a number of individuals with interests and investments in a business or enterprise, among whom expenses, profits, and losses are shared.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s also zoom out from this focus on who does which tasks. Whether PM or researcher, we have been hired to further the success of our companies. The tasks we do are the tactical part of a larger strategy toward business success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get to know your product allies, start with this. Focus on your shared point of reference and the passion you bring to your job to get there. After all, a huge part of the reason we find ourselves confused over who does what task is because the work is meant to be collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose the following perspective: Research and product are not rivals. We have the same high-level goals and bring different skill sets to the table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to communicate how those skill sets translate into responsibilities, then work as partners to reach our goals. And let’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/honoring-non-research-perspective/&quot;&gt;bring those product people (and other non-researchers) into our process&lt;/a&gt; so they can learn and appreciate our skills and mindset—from how we hire, to how we work, to how we share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow may not be your first day in a new role, but it could be the first time you start the day asking the question: How can we address this perceived rivalry with our product counterparts and work together to create a productive, collaborative, partner relationship?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Build together: why co-design beats focus groups ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/co-design-beats-focus-groups</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/co-design-beats-focus-groups</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, the once almighty focus group has fallen from its spot as &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; go-to method for qualitative researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many researchers continue to harp on its virtues, the potential pitfalls are widely discussed in the user research community. Focus groups are increasingly being replaced by other methods like co-creation—with good reason. This holds especially true within the world of user and UX research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the challenges with focus groups? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics often point to the traditional focus group’s tendency to promote groupthink, where the human desire for social consensus wins over sharing individual truths or experiences. Unique perspectives are sometimes drowned out due to an unwillingness to be different in the context of a group, general shyness or fear of speaking in front of others, and other personality traits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, one or two strong voices emerge, and so too does their echo chamber. For example, let’s say you’re leading a focus group to understand how millennials make decisions about large purchases such as appliances. You provide a few minutes to jot down answers to some guiding questions and then open the floor for a group discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first person to speak walks everyone through a process whereby she recently saved for six months via a budgeting app to purchase a new refrigerator without affecting other lines on her budget. She meticulously tracked sales and promotions and waited for the precise moment when the price was right, and she had enough cash to fork over.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, someone shares a similar process with slight differences. At the same time, the people who made impulse purchases and paid extra for fast delivery while maxing out their credit limit may think twice before sharing &lt;i&gt;their &lt;/i&gt;process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may feel embarrassed about their haphazard approach or subtly second-guess what “they usually do.” This could lead them to change their narrative to fit the group: “&lt;i&gt;Well, I did look for sales a few times and I sort of cut down on drinks that month, so I guess I did some financial planning around the purchase.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, perhaps subconsciously, they’re grasping at straws to fit in, and it becomes a genuine challenge for a focus group moderator to draw out the true, individual truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enter: co-creation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, skillful moderation can mitigate these and some other issues inherent in focus groups—but I’d argue for most user researchers, there is a better way to harness the power of a group to generate actionable and nuanced insights: co-creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-creation is a methodology whereby you work &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; your target audience to generate new ideas or solve problems. More than a methodology, it’s a mindset: you regard your users or customers as &lt;i&gt;partners&lt;/i&gt; in your organization’s ultimate goal of delivering the best products or designing the best experiences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any partnership, everyone comes to the table with their strengths and weaknesses. In co-creation, your target audience or current users will likely lack expertise in product development. Co-creation isn’t about asking your user base to tell you &lt;i&gt;what to build&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;how to build it&lt;/i&gt;—that’s still your job.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, your user base &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; experts in their own experience: they know better than anyone what motivates them, what they struggle with, what inspires them, and so on. Put that together with your keen research abilities and product development expertise and, well—what a team!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-creation is a general term that encompasses quite a few potential research methods, sometimes in a group setting and sometimes one-on-one, researcher and participant. Below, I’m sharing one of my favorite co-creation methods in detail, but when you start thinking about co-creation, get creative! Depending on your goals and product, the possibilities are many. The idea is that you get creative and collaborative with your user base to churn out more data about their perspectives based on your research goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Design a new one: a co-creation method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of my go-to methods in a group setting, particularly because it involves getting crafty. Essentially, you provide a bunch of art supplies and ask a group of users to design a new version or part of your product. For example, you may ask them to reimagine your home screen if you have an app.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to execute this method is to start with some guided questions that users can answer on their own to get their creative juices flowing. Going with the above example of an app home screen, you may want to ask them to jot down what they find useful about your app, what’s challenging for them, what needs it doesn’t meet, and what they wish it did that it doesn’t.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, ask your participants to use all the available art supplies to reimagine your home screen. Encourage them to use their imaginations and not worry about feasibility: they should create the app of their dreams without technical constraints in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the group finishes, let each person stand up and share what they created and why. Be sure to ask follow-up questions because understanding the nuances behind what they churned out is the research data you will need to code and analyze later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to get specific feature ideas or UX/UI insights. The purpose is to use what each participant creates to understand their priorities, challenges, behaviors, and motivations so &lt;i&gt;you and your team&lt;/i&gt; can churn out actionable insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say a participant creates a translation feature at the top of your app’s home screen. They explain parts of your app aren’t localized in their native language, which is challenging for them. As a researcher, your takeaway isn’t “we need a translation feature!” but rather, this specific user has a significant pain point around parts of the app that are not localized. That’s data to be coded and analyzed with the rest later on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt;: have someone on your team take copious notes in addition to recording the session (with participant permission, of course). The person leading the discussion before and after your participants create their masterpieces should be someone other than the person taking notes or handling whatever device is recording. Their job is to keep the discussion fun and conversational without trying to multitask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rules of thumb with co-creation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, there are a ton of creative (and less so) methodologies within the realm of co-creation. You can search for ideas or brainstorm with your team to determine which works best for your specific research goal. With that in mind, here are a few things to keep in mind no matter which method you choose:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that co-creation means your users will tell you what to build or how to build it. Look at co-creation to better understand your user base’s inner workings: challenges, behaviors, motivations, what they prioritize and why, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to balance group discussions with individual work to limit groupthink and similar issues arising when conducting research in a group setting. One great way to do this is to have each individual do some visual, documented activity that they share &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; there is too much discussion. This gives a person space to think on their own and holds them accountable for expressing their views despite what others say, as they’ll have a visual that represents their experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While focus groups may have their role in qualitative research, user researchers increasingly favor co-creation methodology for group research that mitigates some of the inherent challenges with focus groups and yields rich and actionable insights.

It’s not, for example, a “must have” in academia and a “nice to have” in tech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rigor is not something one can turn off and on like a light switch and still have research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is about embracing rigor in our UX research practices and addressing the voices that say we can ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I’ll talk about how I’ve seen rigor given a bad name in UX research, define research rigor, and provide some examples of how we can showcase rigor while collaborating with fellow researchers and our stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the truth is: We need rigor for our insights to have influence and to maintain our reputation as researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The rigor controversy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, research rigor is a standard researchers use to evaluate the quality and credibility of their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s the controversy? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers—often academic researchers who’ve pivoted to UX research—are criticized by some for bringing their “academic” thinking into companies. Namely, their adherence to “rigor” in research projects. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Those researchers are slowing us down. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Academic-level standards aren’t necessary here. We just need fast insights.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Research just doesn’t fit into a tech environment. If they can’t adapt to our view, they’re not team players. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I’ve observed and experienced these views, I’ve realized two things. First, people who make these statements don’t entirely understand rigor or its necessity to produce trustworthy insights. Second, they might not know how academic researchers assess rigor and how this assessment method can help UX research grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s tackle these issues, starting with a definition: what is rigor? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Defining research rigor.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, research rigor is a set of standards researchers use to evaluate the quality and credibility of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, as researchers love saying—it depends. Perhaps most fundamentally, it depends on the type of research being conducted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because UX researchers often operate in the qualitative research space, I will focus on rigor in qualitative work. (For a great discussion about the differences between quantitative and qualitative research rigor, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-quantitative-research/&quot;&gt;this Dovetail article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won’t surprise you: in academic literature, there have been years of debate about how best to approach rigor or a rigor-like concept in qualitative research. A book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/naturalistic-inquiry/book842&quot;&gt;Naturalistic Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, published in 1985 by Yvonna S. Lincoln and Egon Guba outlined four concepts that have stood the test of time in evaluating qualitative research rigor. These are credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diving into these concepts in great detail isn’t possible in the space of this article. However, a simple summary of what these concepts entail relates to both &lt;i&gt;internal&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;external&lt;/i&gt; aspects of rigor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rigor is &lt;i&gt;internal&lt;/i&gt;: it is the soundness and precision of your study. For example, how precise is your study when it comes to how you planned it? How appropriate is the chosen method used to answer the research question? How did you collect the data? How did you analyze and interpret the data? How did you report the findings/insights? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, internal rigor is about the strength of the research design. Do we—as researchers—feel confident about what we’ve done? If questioned, can we convey that authority? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rigor is also &lt;i&gt;external&lt;/i&gt;—research rigor is a way to establish confidence and trust in research findings. In other words, it’s not just about how rigorous the research is but how stakeholders perceive its credibility. In academia, that’s research peers, but in UX research, it’s the non-research stakeholders with whom we regularly collaborate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In UX research, we must establish external rigor. If our stakeholders do not trust our insights, it doesn’t matter how rigorous our study design is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How we can embrace rigor in our UX research practices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about how we can establish research rigor in the context of UX research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Internally, with our fellow expert researchers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In academia, qualitative researchers often include their peers in the process, either implicitly or explicitly. An implicit method is documenting every step of the process. This includes: keeping notes on the decisions you make. Recording and transcribing your interviews. Written evidence about issues of concern or choices made in the analysis process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explicitly, this means bringing another researcher into the process to check our procedures and outcomes. This can be especially for teams of one. However possible, always run your research by your fellow researchers or an external peer (keeping in mind confidentiality) to ensure the rigor of your study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a sign of weakness. It is how researchers ensure quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Externally, with our collaborators and stakeholders&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When should we communicate issues of research rigor with our stakeholders? Always. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In academic writing, issues of rigor are often communicated through academic articles—in other words, by using a lot of words. In UX research, as is the case for sharing our research insights, we need to find effective ways to communicate our assessment of the study’s rigor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been at your place of employment for some time, you’ve probably learned a bit about what works and what doesn’t for various stakeholders. You can use these existing tactics for communicating rigor, too. Remember, you’re not just sharing this information to bore them or turn them off from a complicated research process. You’re doing this to inject transparency into the process and grow their trust in your work. It’s OK to communicate that explicitly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rigor is how we have influence. It’s also our reputation.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s reframe research rigor. Instead of seeing it as an obstacle, let’s reclaim it for what it is: An opportunity to be transparent about the research process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research, there are always trade-offs, and there are always shortcomings. Let’s not pretend that they don’t exist. Instead, report them out. That way, we can show our peers and stakeholders what may have impacted our results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By articulating what went wrong or could have gone better, we highlight our awareness of an ideal: a hypothetical perfect study. Even though we will probably never get there, especially in the dynamic world of UX research, we at least understand what could be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embracing rigor does not mean advocating for our work to come to a screeching halt. It is not about making insights irrelevant to our stakeholders in the name of science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers need to understand research rigor and the trade-offs we make when conducting non-rigorous projects and producing non-rigorous insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does mean that as expert researchers, it is our duty to educate our stakeholders about rigorous research and what we are giving up if we cannot meet those standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this transparency and demonstrable willingness to teach comes a solid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90792238/the-rigor-of-ux-is-in-the-research-not-the-design&quot;&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; for high-quality work. If we want our in-house practice to grow and our profession to thrive, we must embrace research rigor. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get the most out of UX research—invest in your organizational conditions]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/invest-organizational-conditions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/invest-organizational-conditions</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;UX researchers are in high demand due to the accelerated rate of digital transformation and disruption occurring in organizations—especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userinterviews.com/state-of-user-research-2022-report#anchor-insight-4&quot;&gt;2022 survey by User Interviews&lt;/a&gt; shows a clear trend. The percentage of respondents who said their company had zero dedicated UX resources declined from 19 percent in 2019 to only 6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But does high demand for UX research mean organizations take full advantage of the knowledge of these professionals and get the best ROI? In my humble opinion, the answer is no. Organizations invest mainly in hiring UX researchers and supplying software tools but a lot less in creating the conditions to enable their work. Let’s dive into it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about skills and UX research positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at any typical ad for a UX research job, you’ll find a strong tendency towards mixed-method researchers or UX research unicorns who can “do it all.” In other words, professionals who can conduct research activities both in the problem &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; solution space. More specifically, I’m talking about job descriptions that describe responsibilities like “using a breadth of research methodologies that span from exploratory to validation,” as well as requiring knowledge of how to conduct usability testing, field studies, interviews, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shows a lack of understanding of how to recruit UX researchers. Some UX researchers are naturally more qualified and interested in the problem space (e.g., people with anthropology backgrounds) or the solution space (e.g., people with design or marketing backgrounds). Listing every possible research method in the hope of finding someone who can do it all and actually has experience is unrealistic in a tight job market. Some organizations could find themselves without resources while overloading existing employees with large workloads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, suppose you recruit very qualified UX researchers from academic backgrounds, and you mostly need them to conduct usability tests to validate assumptions made by executive managers (that sometimes simply want to prove someone else is wrong). In that case, they might get bored very quickly. In this case, you won’t see a good ROI on UX research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at other organizational conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2022 User Interviews survey above, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userinterviews.com/state-of-user-research-2022-report&quot;&gt;31 percent of respondents &lt;/a&gt;mentioned they are particularly unhappy with their organizations’ structure and bureaucracy. &lt;b&gt;This was the biggest reason UX researchers were not happy with their work.   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all organizations have managers who understand UX research in particular. Only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.userinterviews.com/state-of-user-research-2022-report#anchor-insight-2&quot;&gt;35 percent of respondents&lt;/a&gt; worked in a pure UX research team. That means the rest of the 65 percent are supervised by managers that might lack knowledge about what researchers actually do. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/where-should-ux-research-live-7d0e7f86e2db&quot;&gt;pros and cons of reporting to different departments&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s nothing worse than reporting to a manager who doesn’t understand what you do. To get the most out of research, managers should have at least a basic understanding of UX research beyond dry job descriptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many technology organizations adopt an agile mindset and work in sprints. While this can be OK with UX researchers who primarily conduct rapid usability tests, it’s not going to work well with UX researchers working in the problem space on bigger questions that require a very different cadence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make the most of your resources, you’d rather separate them into two teams. By this, I mean one team that conducts more operational UX research activities such as usability and concept testing. And a team that works more on problem definition and exploration and conducts longer ethnographic or strategic studies, as well as more exploratory concept testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I’ve spoken to a few UX researchers whose companies already understand this idea, allowing them to work on one-to-two big strategic questions per quarter. They conduct a few research activities to understand the problem space better and even start ideating solutions. However, if you expect your UX resources to conduct these studies over a one to two-week sprint, it will likely not happen. The time needed to define questions, create a research plan, recruit participants, and analyze data is much longer than when we work in the solution space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we understand the problems preventing companies from getting the best ROI from their UX resources let’s discuss some solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before hiring new UX resources, here are a few things to consider about your organization’s needs and current conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your real needs&lt;/b&gt;. Do you mainly need researchers to work in the problem or solution space? Or both? Do you need someone to execute all the research themselves or someone to teach others how to conduct their own research and democratize research (e.g., product designers, product owners, etc.)? If what you need sounds like the second option, you’ll need someone with research &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; mentoring skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supervision.&lt;/b&gt; Do your intended hiring managers have enough knowledge to supervise UX researchers and understand their work? If not, you may want to hire a practice lead first or think about the right person to manage them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research organization. &lt;/b&gt;While it may be OK for solution-space UX researchers to work in a design team with designers and help them evaluate designs within a typical two-week sprint, this would not fly very well with problem-space research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you intend to look into big questions and dig deep. In that case, you need to plan a structure independent of executional work and scrum/agile methods that are very common in software development but not a good fit for problem-space research. Doing strategic and problem-space research has many advantages, but it has to be given adequate space with the right cadence to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article aims to show you how smart and qualified UX researchers who are given good software tools can help you make better design and business decisions. But everything will depend on whether you provide them with the right conditions to do so and proactively invest in those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capable people who work in less-than-ideal conditions won’t be able to deliver the best work and help your organization harness the highest possible level of insight that delivers the most robust ROI on UX research. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Should UXRs give in when leadership wants to rely on demographics?]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/should-uxrs-give-in-when-leadership-wants-to-rely-on-demographics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/should-uxrs-give-in-when-leadership-wants-to-rely-on-demographics</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked in an organization that doesn’t have much user research experience, you’ve probably been asked to build a better understanding of your team’s user base—using primarily demographic information. Aside from not always being a good match in terms of what UX researchers are best at, demographics often lack enough substance to help with decision-making regarding things like product roadmaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the sake of being on the same page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30326/demographic-data&quot;&gt;demographics&lt;/a&gt; are more or less defined as statistical information about a specific population. Some examples of demographic data points are age, gender, level of education, race and ethnicity, and income.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing about demographics: they’re straightforward metrics. They’re numbers. They can be statistically significant. For all these reasons, they often give &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/linked-entry-missing-how-to-influence-leaders-and-communicate-the-value-of/&quot;&gt;business leaders&lt;/a&gt; the warm fuzzies, while the nuanced qualitative data that relies on smaller (but representative) samples does not. I empathize—I really do. For decades, many exemplary corporations got useful insights by looking at demographic data, and in many cases, market researchers still do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But your research budget is likely limited when you’re working for a small- or medium-sized organization. You’re expected to consistently &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-report-recommendations-examples/&quot;&gt;roll out insights that inform both micro-decisions and product and marketing strategy&lt;/a&gt;. When that’s the case, it’s almost always true that your time and money will be better spent on mixed-methods research. This includes qualitative methods that focus not on generic demographic information but on goals, motivations, challenges, and other in-depth behavioral insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuanced qualitative insights are often more useful than demographic data alone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using demographic data to drive product or marketing decisions at a small- or medium-sized organization often relies on assumptions about mythological averages that aren’t nuanced enough to actually be useful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re a researcher at a company with a recipe app. You learn via demographic data that your current paying user base is 89 percent women, more than half of whom have at least a Bachelor’s degree, are between 30 and 42 years old, and have a household income of $150K or more. If your product team wants to make decisions about features, and your marketing team wants some insights to help them design new pricing experiments—you could make a series of assumptions based on this data. Your assumptions could range from how much a high-income household would be willing to pay for your app to, perhaps, the idea that people who identify as women might be more interested in fancy desserts. Are these assumptions definitely wrong? No. Could they be tested? Yes. But they lack the nuance that transformed UX and User Research from a rarity to a rapidly emerging profession.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to mention that relying solely on demographic data can cause organizations to make generalized assumptions that aren’t super useful. Worse, they can also be harmful assumptions based on antiquated perspectives about age, race, ethnicity, and gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of that in mind, imagine how much more creative your product and marketing teams could get if they could learn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How else might you segment this large demographic that comprises your user base? Are some passionate foodies, while others are just trying to make a quick dinner for three kids after work every day? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within those newly defined groups, what are their typical cooking habits? What about shopping for ingredients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How crucial is your app to each of those groups? Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What challenges with cooking and meal prep does your app solve? What does it not currently solve? What about cooking and meal prep still leaves each user group frustrated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What motivates your users to pay for a recipe app? Why not just search online for free recipes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d be hard-pressed to imagine any product or marketing exec choosing demographic data that often relies on assumptions rather than deep, nuanced behavioral insights like these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are you trying to say it’s useless?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work at a large corporation or somewhere else with a bottomless research budget, or if your company has a lot of demographic data already at hand (perhaps from marketing tools), do I recommend ignoring demographics? Definitely not. But&lt;i&gt; if you have to choose&lt;/i&gt;, using your user behavior data combined with deep, qualitative research will be much more likely to give you actionable insights to pass on to your stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have easy access or a big enough budget to collect statistically significant demographic data. In that case, it may be a good idea to create a research plan where you segment your audience based on behaviors, motivations, needs, and use cases—and then look at the demographic data within each user group.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s stay with our recipe app theme. We want to utilize both qualitative insights and demographic data. In this case, we may find that the Foodie persona is still majority women but includes more men than other user groups. While I’d still argue that the personas or groups that you build without demographic data are far more useful for the types of decisions that small- and medium-sized organizations typically need to make, it could be that adding some demographic info to each of your groups will give your insights about users a little more meat (and quell the concerns of the execs who still can’t really fathom making decisions without demographics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you’re using more nuanced qualitative data alongside demographics, it will help prevent your organization from falling into the trap of making far-reaching assumptions based on things like gender, income, age, and so on—that may lead to faulty decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What if your boss wants demographic data anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard from other researchers who couldn’t convince their managers that demographic data wasn’t the way to go. This is often daunting for UX researchers because collecting statistically significant demographic data isn’t always a simple task. It may even be outside of a UXR’s skill set if they are more qualitatively focused. First, you should check with your user acquisition team. If your organization does any paid user acquisition, it could be that their tools include a lot of demographic data about users acquired via their channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to outsource a demographic study to a large research organization. The advantage is that they not only have people on hand with the necessary skills, but they also generally charge a flat fee (note that it’s not cheap) and will free up your team to work on what you’re really excellent at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your team is asked to collect demographic data, challenge whoever is asking to explain why. In all likelihood, you’ll be able to have a productive and interesting conversation about why behavioral and attitudinal insights may be more valuable when budgets are limited. Or,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;settle on a plan for incorporating both demographics and rich, qualitative insights that honors the complexities of humans—and helps your organization make much more nuanced product and marketing decisions. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Man of tomorrow: Atlassian’s Work Futurist Dominic Price]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/work-futurist-dominic-price</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/work-futurist-dominic-price</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dominic Price, work futurist, has one of the most interesting jobs in the industry. And while he  half-seriously tells me the role was invented “almost as a joke,” there’s no doubt he’s made an impact in the six years since assuming the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part preacher, part soothsayer, part explorer, the graft of a work futurist is as varied as it is interesting. From TedTalks with millions of views to evangelizing executives and setting the pace for scaling Aussie software titan Atlassian—Price is a busy man. And the speed at which work has changed for us all lately means there’s still plenty left to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, with so many major world events shaking the  core of our professional lives, it’s a great time to check in with the work futurist and get a pulse on things to come. In this interview, we cover the big stuff—pandemics, remote work, the four-day workweek, the Great Resignation, Gen Z, and finally—as he is a futurist—we ask him to tell us what the next few years have in store. Price is as compelling in print as he is on the stage—read on and see what the future of work is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*This interview has been edited for length and clarity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;First, what does a work futurist do?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a job we made up five years ago—almost as a joke. It had &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; rationale: Atlassian’s mission is all about unleashing the potential of teams. So, we needed to understand teamwork in the future. Not to predict it, but we needed to have a sense of what that environment looked like because we have to build today what we don’t even know you need yet tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role is essentially made up of three components. One is how we think about scaling Atlassian. We were 600 people when I joined, now we’re about to hit 10,000. You don’t scale to that number by accident. You’ve got to do it on purpose to stay nimble and maintain good ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then two-thirds is external. How do we share the story around that with our customers and bring it to life in our products? And then the final third is how we share this story at conferences, events, whatever, just to get more momentum in the market because I’m a firm believer that we only create the future by taking one step today. If I can get an audience of people to take one step to improve their way of working, I’ve done my job. Because I think one of the things we’ve all suffered is being in shit teams. So why don’t we all just get into good teams and ways of working? We spend enough time at work. We might as well enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;With the pandemic, the Great Resignation, and now an economic crisis, the future of work has been a hot topic lately. What’s your take on all this?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the Dom trademark view: We’re going through some kind of natural evolution. I’ll give you an example—just before the pandemic hit, our third biggest office globally was home. We were noodling our way into that—a few people every month, nice and slowly. We were getting slightly newer ways of working that revolved around distributed teams. And then in mid-March, we went, oh fuck—and we leaned straight into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, the pandemic poured accelerant on all the things that were happening. So I think you would’ve found that people’s sentiment towards work was already starting to get a bit &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;meh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. If you look at any gallop surveys, engagement scores were going down. And so people weren’t over the moon. Companies were making money, but the people felt a bit soulless. They got forced into this way of working and saw a new light. And that’s where the great resignation came in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saw people staying in the same role but changing companies; they want to be more values aligned. Certainly, the generation coming through cares more about values, charities, foundations, and social causes than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Speaking of the next generation: We’re seeing Gen Z’s entrance into the workforce in full swing now. How do you view this?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m loving it because I love the provocation and disruption they bring. Forgive me for mass generalizations, but I think there are a few things that stand true. One is this ferocious curiosity that they have. When I joined the workforce, for my first three years, I was told what to do. I don’t see many Gen Z people entering the workplace doing what they’re told. They’re like, “Hey, I want to know the purpose. I want to know what the outcomes are, and then I want to be left to my own devices to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s great. But it’s a very different way of engaging and leading. They’re also digital natives, while I’m a digital immigrant. A great example of this is how you think about intrinsic motivation. So, when I started working in 2000, it was all about climbing the corporate ladder. And you did that by serving time and pleasing your boss. Now, the social currency is likes and followers, which doesn’t require an org chart. It just requires you to create your own content without approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules have changed. Because every social construct I grew up with had a hierarchy. The social constructs of Gen Z don’t have a hierarchy—everything is ubiquitous and democratized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The four-day workweek has been cropping up a lot lately. What are your thoughts?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a potential use case for some businesses. With any suggestion someone throws at me, I ask, what problem are you solving? And I get a different answer each time for the four-day workweek. Where I struggle is it feels like a singular solution to a multifaceted problem. I would rather work five days and work shorter days. That would work better for me because I work with international teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A four-day workweek might be fine if you are in a domestic business. If you’re in an international business, help me understand how you’re going to pick four days. Because you just made my work life infinitely hard. If you give me Monday off, that’s fine for me, right? But terrible for the team. Because the team has Monday off in San Francisco, they don’t come online until my Wednesday. That’s too late, I’ve missed half the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, I think we will end up having a blurrier set of working hours. I probably work 45 to 50 hours a week. I don’t know how many hours of work, but I have not worked nine to five Monday to Friday for 10 years and won’t for the next 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because as long as I’m getting my work done, it doesn’t matter if I do it on a Saturday or Sunday. I own the discipline of having boundaries around that. But if you said Dom, everyone’s out on a Monday, and that means the US doesn’t get online until my Wednesday. That’s going to stop me from being effective. That’s you forcing a solution on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we need to understand the role flexibility plays in where and when I work. If we can solve for where and when with flexibility—and I think we can—we can really land on a better way of working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What are some of the biggest misconceptions about work today?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few out there that keep on coming up. What’s this misconception that people need to be engaged? I’m intrinsically motivated. Sometimes if you just get out of my way, I’m effective. There’s this old-school notion of leadership that I am here to lead, and I will bestow this knowledge upon you, and you’re like, no, I need you to get out of my way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there are still a lot of challenges around the most senior person knowing all the answers. The best teams I work with in Atlassian are highly democratized. I don’t care how old you are or what level you are—if you are a subject matter expert in that thing, I care about your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a lot of the organizations, if you are the junior person, don’t speak up. You are here to learn. And it’s like, really? You spent all that time in the market hiring a smart person, and then you’re not listening to them. What’s the point of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I keep on hearing that humans don’t like change. Humans have got change fatigue. But humans have been excellent at change their entire life. I just think you’re bad at delivering it. I don’t think it’s that humans are resistant to change. And I think if we get more human with how we think about change programs, rather than broadcasting out to people with fluffy diagrams about how life might be better and instead just have a conversation with them in plain English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Let’s talk about agile. It’s come to be the gold standard as a way of working. How does a large company become agile, and is there anything better?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;People see it as a panacea. They think they’ll get to the end of this 18-month transformation, and the world will change. So there are a few challenges with it. First of all, most of the leaders I work with outside Atlassian want agility. And then what they go and buy from the supermarket is agile transformation. And I have to explain to them that those two things aren’t the same. When consulting firms come in and sell you an agile transformation, they’re coming with a cookie-cutter framework they think works for you. What you want is nimbleness. You can get that from your people. You don’t need to give it a name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s the first mistake. The second mistake is they create an agile transformation, which is an 18- or 24-month program. And then on the last day, some executive flies in, cuts the ribbon on the agile room, and they’re like, there you go, we’re agile now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took you 18 months to achieve incremental improvement. And that’s the irony. You built an 18-month waterfall plan to achieve agility. The whole point of agile is quick value realization. If you truly want to be agile, that’s a way of leading; just step into it. Start doing it on day one and do the transformation in the background. But just start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see a handful of organizations, certainly ASX organizations doing agility more pragmatically. Look at ANZ bank. They almost canned the phrase agile transformation and started talking about new ways of working instead. They were like, we have new ways of working, and that’s constantly evolving. We have new ways of leading and how we expect our leaders to turn up. And by the way, we never finished the new ways of working projects because there will always be new ways of doing things. That’s continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third irony—and I’ll share it with you—this gets me into trouble, but I don’t mind sharing it anyway. I find it deeply amusing that organizations are selling agile transformations and are not agile themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;You’re a work futurist—can you predict the future?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s what’s going to happen—organizations will wake up to the fact that they create value horizontally—across the organization. Most of the tasks and the way they’re organized are horizontal, and they’re going wake up and realize that strategy built up high and cascaded down into departments doesn’t make work happen better. Because when those departments come together to ship value to customers, they speak a different language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best organizations I’m working with now, which I consider relatively futuristic, are solving for their cross-functional teams to make them healthy and effective. They’re asking what network of teams is needed to ship a common outcome to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what it’s going to be called. I might call it &lt;i&gt;fajita&lt;/i&gt; because I like fajitas. But the magic that happens, and I’ve seen it in a few organizations, is they realize they’ve been creating silos by running everything using the organization chart. To work effectively, they need to work laterally across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the first prediction. The second is that we all need to become experts in leading distributed teams, remote, hybrid, or in-office. I don’t care where you are working, but virtually every company I work with is distributed in some fashion—be it time zones, cultures, or customs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be Sydney to Melbourne to Adelaide. It doesn’t matter. You are not in the same human space as your colleagues every day. And the minute that’s true, we all need the muscle to lead distributed teams. And so that’s something that I see just ticking over. It’s not happening enough. But again, the best organizations I’m working with do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third one is this concept of the “healthy team” and figuring out how we drive continual improvement in a healthy team. If you think about the team as the smallest nuclear atom you have in an organization, and you just make one team more effective, eventually, the whole system gets better. And I think that’s the opposite of what’s happening right now with everyone trying to do giant transformations. I think they’re going to become outdated because they don’t work. And instead, people are going to go: you know what, let’s just get one degree better today. If our team gets one degree better this week and then next week we get one degree better, eventually, we’ll get there. Knowing that we will never achieve this mythical best practice cause it doesn’t exist. So instead of best, we just get better. And I think that will be very true in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The hottest thing on the blockchain: Talking peer-to-peer energy trading with Dr. Jemma Green]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/blockchain-energy-trading</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/blockchain-energy-trading</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I called my mother over and said, “Mum, could you hold the baby while I talk to this person?” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Green is describing the day in her hometown of Perth when she first met her business partner, John Bulich, and discovered blockchain. Having just given birth to her first daughter, Green recounts scrambling out of her house clothes in time for the meeting and tells me about the moment she heard about this blockchain thing. It was going to change the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind every founder, every technology, is an aha moment. It’s endlessly fascinating to listen to the unlikely encounters and twists of fate that herald new enterprises. Amidst all the web3 hype for the creative industries, I think most haven’t caught on to what distributed ledger tech can do for the energy transformation to renewables. Dr. Jemma Green, however, figured all this out years ago. Back in 2016, Bulich and Green immediately saw what this tech could do for building decentralized, renewable energy communities. Understanding how blockchain could help communities trade renewable energy, the two decided there and then, on their first encounter, to set up a company—and Powerledger was born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Green’s ideas about blockchain and peer-to-peer energy trading didn’t start in Perth. Following a career in banking and a master’s in sustainability at the University of Cambridge, Green embarked on a nine-month hiking sabbatical while she considered her next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never been someone who could sit and meditate, but I found hiking a kind of meditative experience,” Green explains. “And all of these ideas started popping into my head. One particular idea was to build an eco-village. It was a bit of a radical thought, but it persisted and wouldn’t really go away.”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by the Mayor of Fremantle, Green did work on developing an eco-village as part of an applied PhD. Green recounts how she wanted to create a “marketplace” within an apartment building in the eco-village so residents could fairly trade renewable electricity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what was the answer to Green’s question? What can blockchain do with electricity? As it turns out, quite a bit. While Green does describe blockchain as a useful component to support the energy transition, she is quick to pre-empt skepticism and renounce the blockchain fanaticism that accompanied the technology’s nascence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, you can do nearly all of it without a blockchain, just as you can have supermarkets without barcodes. You’re not going to say: ‘I’m going to that Waitrose because it’s got barcodes,’ no. But because it’s got barcodes, the system is more efficient, stock control is better, there are less mistakes at the cashier.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green explains that having blockchain in the background for record-keeping builds trust in the system, which is necessary to encourage participation in new markets. Another reason is to reduce the risk of issues with trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Say I was to send you a [renewable energy] certificate in Oslo. The buyer says, ‘Well, send me the certificate, and I will send you the money.’ The seller says, “Well if I send you this certificate, how do I know if you’re going to pay me?” And no one wants to be the first mover because there’s counterparty settlement risk involved,” explains Green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whereas with blockchain, the transfer of the certificate and the digital payment from digital currency are one and the same entry on the blockchain. One cannot happen without the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green points to the 2018 European Union clean energy package directive as a catalyst for the emergence of energy communities in Europe. The EU Directive is a legal framework that includes provisions for citizens to create local energy markets. Enabling people to trade energy with one another from, for instance, solar panels installed on your rooftops is an exciting idea for a few reasons. The main benefit, explains Green, is that it encourages closer proximity trading and energy consumption, which provides a service to the grid. Because we don’t choose when the sun shines and the wind blows, and sometimes the sun shines and the wind blows too much, people store and trade energy &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it overloads the grid via the substation. Substation what, I ask? Green introduces another analogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think about the grid a bit like a tap: say you turn the water to the max. But say you had ten times the amount of water going through, it would burst the tap. [Substations] are only built to cope with a certain amount of volume, and if there is too much pressure on them, then it moves their lifespan from 30 years to 20 years to ten years, and that’s a multimillion-dollar piece of equipment. So, creating the local market within the town, encouraging people to store and trade energy with each other, reduces the pressure on grid infrastructure like substations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our talk concludes with a discussion on another equally fascinating facet of Powerledger’s business model—their cryptocurrency POWR, a purpose-built digital currency for accessing their software. (full disclosure: this is not a sponsored article, but I did buy £15 of POWR. Out of curiosity. Just to see how it behaves). Here, Green outlines the digital shift she imagines we will see in the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the same way we’ve got citizen journalists and citizen bloggers, we will have a new energy paradigm: a two-sided market with citizen energy utilities and citizen energy retailers. Ultimately, they will be able to trade and settle with each other financially on the blockchain. To start, the energy traded will be integrated into the customer’s electricity bill, but eventually, they will have enough of their own energy data to simply trade their excess solar energy and settle with our digital currency. I think that’s an exciting future stake.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree. That is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Continuous Discovery Habits with Teresa Torres ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/continuous-discovery-teresa-torres</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/continuous-discovery-teresa-torres</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Teresa Torres immediately strikes you as a coach—in the traditional sporting sense. She’s passionate, vivacious, and brimming with enough energy to power a small village. Her voice is a little hoarse, giving the impression she’s recently been shouting from the sidelines of a basketball court. A tendency to speak her mind and a no-bullshit attitude conjure images of pep talks and rousing half-time speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an image she carries well. And as someone who’s been on the frontline of product development for decades, Torres is well worth listening to. Particularly when she’s dropping 50-megaton truth bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I hear product managers say they don’t have time to do research, what I hear is ‘I don’t care enough about building a product that matter&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;,’” Torres opines. “I know that’s not what people mean when they say that, but that’s the reality. If you can’t find 30 minutes a week to talk to a customer, how in the world are you going to build something that meets that customer’s needs?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you can’t tell, Torres feels strongly about research. So much so that she’s dedicated her career and an entire book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Discovery-Habits-Discover-Products/dp/1736633309&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuous Discovery Habits&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book, which has been lauded by product leaders like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/getting-in-front-of-the-customer-with-marty-cagan/&quot;&gt;Marty Cagan&lt;/a&gt;, is fast becoming a mainstay on the bookshelves of PMs worldwide. It’s easy to see why. Torres covers an immense territory in a short span, instructing her audience in an easy-to-follow, tactical way, helping them achieve a continuous cadence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-method-discovery-product-management/&quot;&gt;discovery work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our hour-long conversation, we dig down into the details of &lt;i&gt;Continuous Discovery Habits&lt;/i&gt;, talk product team best practices, explore experience maps, and the product management veteran predicts the future of the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Becoming the coach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before becoming what was likely the first Product Discovery Coach, Torres had a varied career. She began as a designer—or as she puts it—“a front-end engineer with a human-centered background,” working for “companies that don’t really care about design.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the early days of digital products, and like many in her cohort, she stumbled into product management. “Eventually, I worked at a company with a VP of Product, and when I started working there, he was like, ‘You’re not a front-end engineer or a designer. You’re actually a product manager.’ And I was like, ‘Okay, that sounds cool, let’s do that.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before Torres found herself leading teams and even entire organizations, going from VP of Product to a stint as CEO. “I didn’t love being an executive,” she confides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of working at “founder-led” start-ups where she would have to fight for customer-driven decision-making, Torres quit the executive life and took on a new mantle as a Product Discovery Coach. “I had this core belief,” she tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you talk to your customers, you will build better products. I want to figure out how to help teams talk to their customers more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why discovery matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Discovery is just the work we do to decide what to build. Every product team on earth is doing discovery.” Torres explains why she chose to focus on this particular part of the product development cycle. In typical Torres style, she provides a lot of detail quickly. “Now, actually, that’s not true because sometimes their stakeholders are doing discovery and telling them what to build,” she adds caustically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all teams are doing discovery and it&amp;#39;s an ongoing, iterative process, then the idea of continuously involving customers is a no-brainer. This is the thesis of &lt;i&gt;Continuous Discovery Habits&lt;/i&gt; and the core mission of Torres’ professional life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that product teams should regularly connect with customers is straightforward. But that’s not the way the world works. Even though the product community broadly supports customer-led product development, where agile teams make autonomous decisions about what to build next based on research and insights, most businesses still struggle to execute this operating model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to why, Torres blames the internet. “Before the internet, waterfall and business stakeholders deciding what to build worked just fine,” she says. “It worked because you didn’t have to build the best product. You had to get on store shelves and have a better position than your competitor, right? So the biggest differentiator was distribution. It wasn’t the quality of your product.” Torres says the internet evened the playing field for distribution, and product quality became much more important. Greater access to information also gave consumers more power over their choices, and it became harder to force bad solutions on people who knew full well there were better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most product managers aren’t product managers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses change at a “glacially slow pace,” says Torres. Most still operate on a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management&quot;&gt;Taylorism&lt;/a&gt;” philosophy of efficient assembly lines. This is why she argues that “probably 90 plus percent” of product managers aren’t actually product managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of innovating, connecting products to marketable solutions, and driving development in a customer-centric direction, most product managers are “cranking widgets on this assembly line.” Essentially, most product managers are operating on a day-to-day level as project managers. Without consistent, strategic connections with customers—without a &lt;i&gt;continuous&lt;/i&gt; discovery motion, where PMs uncover, evaluate, plan, and market new solutions, Torres is arguing that it’s hard to call what most PMs do &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;product management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/ya30re/as_a_product_manager_i_stopped_doing_product/&quot;&gt;a common complaint&lt;/a&gt; echoed throughout product management communities across the internet. But there’s hope—many of the world’s most successful companies are working in a new way that leads to better outcomes. While Torres says that ditching your old company and finding a new one is always an option, she’s also bullish on simply changing the way you work as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screw buy-in, do it anyway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious first step to ditching the widget-cranking life and becoming a &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; product manager is to talk to customers regularly. And if you work at an organization that makes this difficult, do it anyway. “I’m probably a single degree away from somebody who’s my customer. So why do I need permission? Whose buy-in do I need?” asks Torres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product coach argues that you can always find someone to speak to. And once you’ve had those conversations, you should ensure the value is known across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you work with customer-facing teams who aren’t always comfortable with you speaking to their contacts. In that case, Torres says to ask to sit in on a few conversations, get them comfortable with the idea, and show your skeptical co-workers you’re not going to do any damage. “When they’re comfortable with that, maybe the next thing you do is you ask if you can ask a question at the very end of the conversation and maybe even tell your colleague ahead of time what you’re gonna ask so that it’s not scary,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do it regularly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Start by talking to one customer a week,” says Torres. And if that sounds like a lot, get there continuously. “You can get to one a month and then one every three weeks and then one every two weeks and eventually one a week. For some teams, that’s going to be adequate, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work at a company that releases slowly, that should be enough. If you release more regularly, you should look at upping the cadence. “I have worked with teams that talk to customers every single day. I have talked to customers every single day. I have worked with plenty of teams where I would say do not talk to a customer every day because you’re going to be overwhelmed with data, your delivery process doesn’t work fast enough to support that, and you’re just wasting energy. So I think it’s really important the feedback cycle matches your delivery cadence,” she tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keep it small&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this piece, I dropped a polarizing Torres take. To paraphrase: if you don’t have time to talk to customers, you don’t care about making a product that matters. It’s harsh but fair. But Torres has the answer for the average time-poor Product Manager—don’t make research a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The time thing, it’s really about project-based research,” says Torres, referring to the traditional approach to research planning. “We don’t have time to do project-based research. A product team does not have time to talk to 12 customers in a week. They don’t. There are too many other things that they need to do as part of their job. So I think a lot of that comes from this old model of project-based research and getting buy-in and being allowed and finding time,” opines the product coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we adopt a continuous cadence, all of those things go away. Everybody has 30 minutes they can fit on their calendar,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Build your knowledge. Make it shareable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuous Discovery Habits&lt;/i&gt; is full of tips, tricks, frameworks, templates, models, and more for getting better at discovery and making great products. You really should read it. It’s impossible to summarize all the fantastic work Torres has done in the space of the 200-odd pages of &lt;i&gt;Discovery Habits&lt;/i&gt; here. But I’d like to zoom in on one particular exercise she recommends—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producttalk.org/2016/01/why-drawing-maps-sharpens-your-thinking/&quot;&gt;the experience map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experience map is a visual representation of what you and your team already know about the customer and their problems. Before doing any research, make that explicit. Have each team member provide their unique perspective on the customer problem you’re working on. It’s important that everyone completes this individually to avoid groupthink and that the scope is limited to a specific outcome you’re looking to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experience map can help align the team around the customer problem. “A lot of team disagreement comes from the fact that I know some stuff, and you know different stuff. We’re not sharing that, so we’re drawing different conclusions,” says Torres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once everyone has completed their map, compare and contrast. Don’t look for “wrong” or “right.” Instead, be curious, focus on the differences between each map and try to understand how each team member has understood the problem. Once you’re done, synthesize everyone’s maps by turning each aspect into “nodes” and “links.” A node is a specific moment in time, and links join nodes. Include everything from all your team’s maps, collapsing similar nodes. Remember: don’t just add the “happy path.” Capture steps that have to be redone, where people might give up out of frustration, or where steps might loop back on themselves. Finally, add context to your map for each step. What was the customer feeling, thinking, and doing at each step of the journey?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a fully synthesized experience map, you have something to test when you go and talk to customers. “It’s this living document that allows you to capture what you think you know about your customer. Because we’re explicit about that, every interview we run can test it. We can evolve it and iterate on it,” says Torres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best product teams&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Torres, there’s no such thing as the perfect team. There are many ways to do it well, and some core principles she looks for. Here’s an at-a-glance look at the high-level principles you should strive for in your product team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is your team truly cross-functional? &lt;/b&gt;“Do we have product manager, designer, software engineer, and other roles collaborating on what they’re building? Not just with handoffs or passing the buck down the line?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you engaging with your customer?&lt;/b&gt; “How good are your feedback loops? How often is your team engaging with customers?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you working sustainably? &lt;/b&gt;“I would rather a team talk to one customer weekly and have sustainability, which is why I talk a lot about habits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you know anything about reliability and validity? &lt;/b&gt;“We’re not expert researchers; we don’t need to be expert researchers. But we need to know a little about the concepts of reliability, validity, and research. How do I know what a participant tells me in an interview matches their behavior? How do I know if I interview someone tomorrow, they’ll tell me the same thing? How do I know if I run an assumption test, the way that a customer interacts with my prototype is the way they’ll interact with the product?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of Product&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Torres to grab the crystal ball, and tell us what the future has in store for the product world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True to form, she gave me the most down-to-earth answer I’ve heard. “I think for most of us that are alive right now, for the rest of our lives, we’re gonna be getting good at the existing stuff,” she tells me. “And I don’t mean that the existing stuff is the endpoint and the be-all-end-all, but it’s going to take so long to get good at this stuff. In broad strokes, I think 50 years from now, we’re still going to be looking at how to engage with our customers more often. How do we get more reliable feedback from them? How do we build iteratively so we don’t build too much? I don’t think those things are going away,” she says before adding, “Humans change too slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this sounds like a dim view of the future, somehow Torres sounds optimistic when she says it. Like a true coach, what excites her most about the future is perfecting our fundamentals, getting good at the basics. And rather than getting frustrated by the glacial pace of change, it invigorates Torres, inspiring her to pull up her sleeves, take action, and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She leaves me with a final bit of continuous discovery wisdom: “If we can see that we’re getting better and if we assume we keep getting better, then 50 years from now will be better than we are now, and that’s good enough for me. That’s the value of continuous improvement. I don’t have to worry about five years from now. I just have to worry whether next week looks a little better than last week.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The problem with problems]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-problem-with-problems</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-problem-with-problems</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard that saying (often attributed to Henry Ford even though he probably didn’t say it): “If I would have asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” The “quote”—at this point a bit old and tired in product circles—is often used to inspire teams to focus on the customer’s core problem and help them develop a similarly innovative solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with this quote-not-quote is that most product teams simply aren’t in a position to pasture the horse and build an assembly line. Instead, it’s more like they’ve been handed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.ford.com/articles/history/henry-fords-greatest-innovation-the-quadricycle.html#:~:text=Apart%20from%20the%20motor%2C%20wheels,selected%20by%20twin%20drive%20belts.&quot;&gt;1896 Quadricycle&lt;/a&gt; and told to figure out how to improve upon it. (Case in point: with no steering wheel, brakes, or reverse, the 1896 Quadricycle was the original MVP). So, how do &lt;i&gt;these &lt;/i&gt;product teams figure out how to balance gradual improvements to the Quadricycle while simultaneously identifying what the next motor vehicle should be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Mr. Ford had a UX Researcher at his disposal to help navigate this terrain (not really, but since we frequently falsely attribute a quote to him, I figure we can also do the same with team members). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This UX Researcher explained to Mr. Ford that &lt;i&gt;now that he has a product&lt;/i&gt;, he has two problems to worry about and balance: product and customer problems. Worse yet, if he doesn’t balance them well, he’ll also have a third type of problem: business problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not in any history books, but I feel sure that if the UX Researcher were to break it down for product teams today, it would go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product problems &lt;/b&gt;point to the deficiencies in our products. They exist only because our products exist. That list of feature requests your favorite customer just sent you—that’s probably a list of product problems. The improvements your sales and customer success teams have been asking for—also likely a list of product problems. The content of NPS responses and technical support tickets—you guessed it. Probably almost all product problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: managing and responding to product problems is essential for product success. Our agile development processes push us to create and deliver products and features that are MVPs—in other words, knowingly inadequate. Post-launch we attend to the feedback provided by a multitude of sources, with the goal of prioritizing what to build next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working to improve an existing product, it is easy to become so myopically focused on product problems that we lose sight of the customer’s problem(s). And, because they are often resolving deficiencies in the product, they are often not the type of improvements that are market-worthy. And problems that aren’t market-worthy can be difficult to “sell” to leadership as they rarely result in significant revenue gains to the business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer problems &lt;/b&gt;are the true problems of our customers and prospects. They exist because our customers exist. In modern parlance, they are the “jobs” in Jobs To Be Done nomenclature. That is, they represent needs that exist for our customers (or prospects) regardless of whether there are a plethora of options and solutions in the marketplace or none at all. They get to the core of why a customer is using your product and what they hope the product will accomplish for them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the customer problem is painful enough and your solution novel enough, a market opportunity exists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity doesn’t have to be large enough to charge a fee, but if it’s at least “marketable” (i.e., something you can present at a conference or write a press release about), then you know you’ve hit on something worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there are &lt;b&gt;business problems. &lt;/b&gt;Which are, as they sound, the problems of the business. These problems are frequently revenue-oriented and driven by leadership. They manifest through statements like, “We need to increase market share” or “we need to be able to better compete against XYZ.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful organizations have to be cognizant of these demands and their position in the marketplace. However, it’s critical not to confuse business problems with product or customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different stakeholder groups are often focused on different problem types due to the demands of their role. While each of these different problem types is important, they often get pitted against each other, with the various stakeholder groups lobbying for what is “most important.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, executives tend to identify business problems and customer-facing teams tend to focus on product problems. It’s the job of the product team to maintain focus on the customer problem without losing sight of the product and business problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As UX Researchers, we are uniquely qualified to help our stakeholders navigate this dizzying balance of problems. First and foremost, it’s our responsibility to ensure that, regardless of any other problem type we might be focused on, it always overlaps with the customer problem. Otherwise, it’s not worth doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the opportunity for innovation lies in the intersection between these three problem types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying a solution that truly solves a customer problem while also resolving product problems is a recipe for meeting the business’s objectives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, our relative objectivity on a team enables us to identify and name which types of problems we are addressing and with what specific improvements. As skilled facilitators, we can host a workshop to help our stakeholders map the various problems to their types and ideate solutions that span all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to our 1896 Quadricycle. With no real breaks and no steering wheel, there’s no doubt that motorists experienced the &lt;i&gt;product&lt;/i&gt; problem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-first-car-accident-in-1896-involved-a-bicycle&quot;&gt;crashing into things&lt;/a&gt;. The problem of crashing into things—or, put another way, the need to stop the vehicle—only exists because the product exists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people were just walking around, they probably weren’t randomly crashing into things (unless they were drunk, but for now, we’ll assume they were sober). It seems silly for us to think about now, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abebrakes.com/en/information-en/the-history-of-braking-systems/&quot;&gt;early automotive inventors were more concerned with motion than braking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we focus specifically on the &lt;i&gt;product&lt;/i&gt; problem, we might offer various “stopping” solutions such as: throwing out an anchor or dragging your feet, Fred Flinstone style. In fact, the actual solutions put forward in terms of early improvements to brakes ultimately failed because they didn’t focus on the &lt;i&gt;customer&lt;/i&gt; problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;customer’s&lt;/i&gt; problem is that people need to get from point A to point B—comfortably and as quickly as possible, without fear of injury or death to themselves or others. As it turns out, the intersection between comfort and speed required an entirely new invention: the pneumatic tire. Pneumatic tires provided a more comfortable riding experience and allowed for faster speeds. But faster speeds and different tires require an entirely new type of brake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the real invention that resulted from the intersection between customer problems (go somewhere quickly and comfortably) and product problems (without crashing into things) was a new tire with brakes inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there is an actual Henry Ford quote that better aligns with the moral of our story: “There are no big problems, there are just a lot of little problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words: don’t get so caught up in solving product or business problems that you lose sight of your customers’ problems!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be clear about what specific type of problem each of those “little problems” are, identify the intersection between them, and then look for those magical opportunities for innovation. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Face-to-face is here to stay]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/face-to-face-is-here-to-stay</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/face-to-face-is-here-to-stay</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;User research has a lot to lose from this &lt;i&gt;everything can be done virtually &lt;/i&gt;mentality if we don’t take time to reflect on what we miss when making cuts to face-to-face research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why aren’t you doing face-to-face research? ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/face-to-face-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/face-to-face-research</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’d be remiss not to acknowledge the positive aspects of a forced transition to remote work for knowledge workers. It’s been over two and half years since the world came to a standstill and work as we knew it morphed into something else. Some of us experienced a life-altering shift, whether it was the ability to live out our digital nomad dreams or increased flexibility when scheduling the things that matter to us outside of work.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, what I really want to talk about is how the drastic switch to &lt;i&gt;remote&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; has affected user research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consider methods like interviewing, there are the obvious benefits of remote research that were well-known even before the pandemic: you can interview people all over the world, right from your home or office. You can save exponentially on the cost of travel if your workplace isn’t physically close to your target audience and more easily diversify your research sample. You can seamlessly record Zoom sessions and automatically generate transcripts five minutes after you speak with a user. Simple, fast, cost-effective.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those reasons and more, virtual research has a legitimately vital role on most research teams, mine included. But user research has a lot to lose from this &lt;i&gt;everything can be done virtually &lt;/i&gt;mentality if we don’t take a moment to reflect on what we miss when making serious cuts to face-to-face research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, a lot of research has been done about the extent to which virtual interactions can replace face-to-face interactions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbesinsights/Business_Meetings_FaceToFace/index.html&quot;&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; by Forbes found that business executives overwhelmingly found that in-person meetings are crucial for building strong relationships. Paul Axter, Corporate Trainer and Author summarized the reasons why very well in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/hilton/the-science-of-being-there/&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;: “In-person meetings provide a sense of intimacy, connection, and empathy that is difficult to replicate via video…It’s much easier to ask for attentive listening and presence, which creates the psychological safety that people need to sense in order to engage and participate fully.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships, empathy, connection, attentive listening, and presence are all at the very core of quality user research that makes people seen and heard within an organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your behavior and attentiveness affect the quality of the data you’re gathering, but the benefit of face-to-face research extends beyond data quality. In many cases, a researcher can actually generate &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; data through in-person interactions. For a range of research methods, from interviews to ethnography and contextual inquiry, you miss out on a lot of useful context and insight when staring at a computer rather than sitting across from your research subject. To name a few:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the participant’s body language tell you when you consider it alongside what they’re saying or doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What topics of conversation come up when you’re taking a coffee break? Who is this &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;whole person&lt;/i&gt;, and how does it inform their interaction with your product or their general approach to whatever you’re discussing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s it like to be in the presence of someone frustrated by something specific? What’s it like to be in the presence of someone fired up about the work they’re doing? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do your participants interact with each other? What do they choose to talk about? What do they get excited about when they’re in a group setting talking about a topic relevant to your research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any researcher who has done significant face-to-face research could likely add something to this list. Is it possible to create virtual experiences that provide these insights? For sure. But I have yet to meet a researcher who’d argue that it’s the rule rather than the exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://lightricks.com&quot;&gt;Lightricks&lt;/a&gt;, we work with creators who make visual content. Through virtual research methodology, my colleagues and I have learned a lot about workflows, challenges, goals, and so on. But the sixth sense that we seek to hone over time about how to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; serve our users is equally, if not more, informed by the times we sit with them in a room and debate the challenges of social media for creators or watch their body language while they struggle to realize their creative vision with an app. That sense gets sharper when we’re heading downstairs to walk them out, and they just &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to show us the Instagram post that one of their favorite creators just posted because it relates to our earlier conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important factor when it comes to experiencing your target audience is &lt;i&gt;focus&lt;/i&gt;. Most researchers know how to ensure no ringing, pinging, or momentary web surfing occurs during a moderated research session—one would hope. But it’s happened to all of us. One of our participants inevitably succumbs to a digital distraction that comes with research taking place behind screens. When you’re face-to-face with your participants, your mutual attention often makes for a more quality experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know who deserves a paragraph of their own in this ode to face-to-face research? Stakeholders. If you, as a researcher, have ever brought a stakeholder to meet and experience users, then you’ve witnessed something truly spectacular. Rather than another interesting Zoom in a day full of Zooms, you’re usually witnessing a transformative experience; not only the acquisition of knowledge about users (which is great) but a certain energy that comes from spending time with the people that they’re building for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between connection, attention, presence, and focus—plus extra data points—in-person research shouldn’t go out of style anytime soon. As a researcher, I’ve had plenty of &lt;i&gt;aha &lt;/i&gt;moments and generated a ton of actionable insights from remote research. But what the people in finance slashing your budget now that you “don’t need” face-to-face research might not know: &lt;i&gt;there is immense and tangible value in experiencing your target audience. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I’m hearing anecdotally from my fellow researchers, whether from startups, Big Tech, or elsewhere, is mixed. Some teams are exclusively conducting remote research, while some have managed to keep up or increase their face-to-face initiatives. More and more, I sense from my colleagues that factors such as global economic uncertainty and the post-pandemic excitement around how much can be done remotely make it difficult to get organizational buy-in for in-person work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, research teams have to adapt to economic realities and social phenomena like everyone else. What I’m suggesting is not a complete rejection of remote research but rather the adoption of a mindset that includes as much face-to-face research &lt;i&gt;as possible&lt;/i&gt; within the confines of finances, geography, timelines, and everything else that matters to your organization.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since things like speed and financial constraints differ from organization to organization, it’s impossible to assert what percentage of a team’s work should be virtual vs. face-to-face. Here is my rule of thumb: as much as time and money allow.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set a goal, and consider it positively correlated with the quality and depth of your research. Even in tough economic times, user advocates (which, above all else, is the job description for a user researcher) should see it as worth fighting for.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don’t be a feature factory]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/dont-be-a-feature-factory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/dont-be-a-feature-factory</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/outlier/how-to-make-something-simple&quot;&gt;I think the biggest risk when it comes to creating a product is that you just become a feature factory. &lt;u&gt;You have all of these features but nothing feels like it&amp;#39;s prioritized.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to make something simple with Jess Faccin from Canva]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-to-make-something-simple</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-to-make-something-simple</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing Outlier: Quality content for craft lovers]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/introducing-outlier</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/introducing-outlier</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Challenging the status quo and inspiring, Outlier hosts stories about the products, people, and organizations who are contributing to a better world by improving the quality of every thing—this includes everything from profiles, to interviews with industry titans, along with opinion pieces and commentary analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immersive, interactive, and accessible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlier aims to provide something for everyone who is passionate about products and hungry for content to help master their craft.

What if we made this a “must-have” role on UX research teams?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role—necessarily held by a research expert—solely focuses on influencing how research is received, perceived, and acted upon by non-research stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX researchers wear many hats. They do full-time project work. They build relationships with cross-functional teams. They advocate for the insights uncovered in project work. (They are also responsible for research operations if there are no dedicated staff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what, you might say. Every job has multiple responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreed. But let’s dive in a bit more, starting with a definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Defining the Research Evangelist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard the term &lt;i&gt;evangelist&lt;/i&gt; before. It might conjure up religious meaning, and indeed that is where the word originates: To “convert or seek to convert (someone) to Christianity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research evangelism is about converting a non-researcher to an insights-ready mindset, one where research insights play an informed and essential role in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But aren’t we just &lt;i&gt;advocating&lt;/i&gt; for our insights? Isn’t conversion too strong?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the definition of “convert:” To “change the form, character, or function of something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are responsible for changing the form, character, and function of stakeholders’ decisions. In essence, how they do their work and understand their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are attempting to change an existing way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that? We deserve a specialization—the research evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why we need research evangelism  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to illustrate this point with a nod to my academic origins. Let’s compare academic and applied research. Academic researchers craft contributions to an existing, often global field of study, facilitated by a university. Applied researchers craft insights to identify and solve real-world problems, often in the context of a company or organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because academic researchers, like UX researchers, have a dual responsibility to &lt;i&gt;conduct &lt;/i&gt;and to &lt;i&gt;share &lt;/i&gt;research. Sharing is what defines academic researchers’ success. Presenting and publishing their work allows them to thrive in their profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX researchers, too, must share research insights to have impact in their role. One could argue that having research expertise is necessary but far from sufficient to be successful: a UX researcher must share &lt;i&gt;actionable&lt;/i&gt; insights to ensure their insights are applied to the business and, ultimately, increase its financial success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference? An academic researcher is engaging an audience that’s already drunk the Kool-Aid. Whether it’s a heated debate at an academic conference about choice of method or theoretical framing or a peer reviewer at a journal article complaining about the perceived overreach of conclusions, discussion participants are all on the same team. When academics share research insights, no one is debating the relevance of the scientific method. The necessity of a carefully structured research design. The very premise of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience that UX researchers find themselves in front of is, to put it mildly, very different. They are non-researchers. Nothing is sacred. Often, no set of universal standards governs the discussion. In this example, the academics have it easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many of you—especially in low UXR-maturity organizations—recognize you’re not simply responsible for sharing insights in an agreed-upon form. That you’re dealing with stakeholders who don’t understand or actively resist your definition of an insight? Or discount your perspective on what it means to be user-centric?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe your stakeholders understand and appreciate research insights but struggle to incorporate them into existing decision-making processes and need your help and expert guidance to convince leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence: We need Research Evangelists because we are not preaching to the converted. First, we must convert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to separate research evangelism from other roles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some would say evangelism or advocacy is entrenched in Research Operations. Others would say it’s simply part of an individual contributor job or at least a UXR Lead or manager’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with operations. Research Operations does indeed have a crucial role in research advocacy. Research Operations professionals need to ensure that the structure is there to share research insights coherently and impactfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Research Evangelist takes a different focus: It is not about building and maintaining the structure for storing and sharing research. It requires taking the ops-designed advocacy structure and evangelizing it to non-research stakeholders full-time. Coming back to the origins of our term, the insights repository created by operations professionals is like a Bible held in the hands of the Research Evangelist. Those insights—crafted under the supervision of research experts—are our source of truth when it comes to evangelizing the power of insights-driven decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding IC or lead roles: We hire UX researchers to focus on a subset of users. As a company matures its practice, researchers often focus on a holistic user group or the users of a particular product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employing a Research Evangelist takes this evolution further: an evangelist focuses on internal user groups—non-research stakeholders. The evangelist can apply all their research skills to understand these users. They can conduct internal research to understand needs and pain points and craft solutions based on the unique profiles of their stakeholder-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean the UX researcher is off the hook when insights are delivered. UX researchers: Have you experienced the pain of wanting to disseminate insights and brainstorm solutions with stakeholders but need to move on to the next project? The Research Evangelist solves this problem by ensuring insights are acted upon and influencing non-research stakeholders to understand the insights-ready mindset any user-centric company needs to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for managers? Managers are often at the top of the hierarchy on their teams. In hierarchical organizations, they will have the greatest chance of getting in front of high-level leadership. It would be counterproductive to take this opportunity away from them. But their key responsibility is to their team. Let’s let them focus on hiring and nurturing talent and collaborate with the Research Evangelist on the best strategies to communicate with “out of reach” leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until a company shifts its mindset to being insights-ready, until it incorporates user insights into every decision-making process, evangelism is a necessary specialization for UX research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do I find a Research Evangelist?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This person is an expert researcher. They have to be because they must be fluent in what they are evangelizing. They must be ready for skepticism and even hostility. What helps them stay strong is their commitment to empirical research to study the world as it is, their unflappable trust in the scientific method, and an undying cheerfulness for converting the cynics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look around. You might already have one on your team.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[This doesn’t feel like a bank: how top-notch CX wins hearts and minds]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/up-bank-cx</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/up-bank-cx</guid><pubDate>Invalid Date</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The banking sector doesn’t usually cause much of a stir when it comes to innovation. Solid, reliable, &lt;i&gt;safe&lt;/i&gt;, and probably boring are words that come to mind when I think of financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s so damned cool to see &lt;a href=&quot; https://up.com.au/&quot;&gt;Australian NeoBank Up&lt;/a&gt; explode onto the market with a brand and product that feels fresh. (Yes, I just used the word cool and bank in the same sentence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the “face-melting” welcome packages and colorful branding to the sheer intelligence and gutsiness of their product, Up is a fantastic example of what can happen when you combine world-class CX with a tech-driven customer-centric product philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of buzzwords, I know. But bear with me—Up is proof these terms aren’t empty slogans. They are real things, and when implemented effectively, they are the secret sauce that results in groundbreaking innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s dive a bit deeper and unpack it all a bit with the help of Up’s Head of Marketing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tagell/?originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;Paul Tagell&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, by the end of the article, you feel inspired to take some risks, think deeply about your customer experience at every touchpoint, and understand how a focused philosophy and mission can bleed through in every interaction you have with your customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not like other banks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first impression I get of Paul is that he isn’t like other marketers. In my mind, the Head of Marketing at a bank wears a suit—even in the shower—they live in an office filled with polished mahogany and talk in smooth three-letter acronyms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul, on the other hand, is a regularly dressed, down-to-earth guy who seems genuinely stoked to be doing cool shit with his team. He’s kind of nerdy and clearly smart. He feels like the kind of person you could have a beer with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the energy I get when I look at Up, too. Their distinctive orange branding, colorful onboarding packs, and fun flourishes throughout the app, ooze personality, authenticity, and good vibes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re always looking to create an experience that doesn’t feel like a bank,” Tagell tells me during our convo. He doesn’t say it with any animosity directed at banking. After all, Up is a bank. But he does make the funny distinction between what Up and other neobanks are doing and what they refer to internally as “all caps banking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a marketing perspective, you get a really engaging ad or newsletter, go to our website or talk to us, and you speak to a person who’s human and treats you like a mate,” he elaborates. “Our platform does some really useful and powerful things, but at the same time, when you interact with us, you feel like you’re talking with a friend. It’s technology made for humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up combines a human-centered approach with powerful technology and a customer experience that not only delights and engages but consistently reiterates the fundamental philosophy of Up. Everything is designed to make dealing with money easier and more engaging. The entire experience gives the customer a sense of control over their finances that they previously didn’t feel they had to improve their financial wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First interactions matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you first sign in to Up, the onboarding flow is quick, atomic, and easy to follow. Tagell says it was built with a coffee line in mind. The idea is that someone could tell you about Up and invite you in app at the beginning of a line, and by the time you get to the front, you’d have an account with five dollars in it as a referral bonus. It’s called “instant provisioning,” and Up was the first bank in Australia to offer it. The message from the very first interaction is clear. Up is not like other banks. In fact, you can turn everything you know about how banks operate on its head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, your welcome pack arrives in the mail. “We put in a lot of time into considering what customers’ first physical experience would be. Most banks would send you a tri-folded piece of paper with a card glued into it. You’ll open it and just chuck it away,” explains Tagell. “Our goal was to deliver a bank card but also melt people’s faces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colorful welcome pack comes replete with stickers and a custom mailer made from beer mat board that you can slide your bank card into. It looks fantastic, and there’s a bingo game on the back that encourages you to pick a number each week, cross it off, and add the amount to your savings over the course of a year. “For us, that was about setting the tone: we’re here to help you manage your money. We want you to understand that everything we do is to help Upsiders spend wisely and save effortlessly,” says Tagell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fun flourishes and charming elements aren’t just there to entice; they serve a fundamental purpose. They disrupt, differentiate, engage, and deliver a clear message about what the bank is all about. Every detail of the customer experience is focused on delivering the right message, and every moving part of the business works in sync to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Driven by technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always been super technology and product-led, but the most important thing is that our ethos has always been to help a generation of Australians get more control and understanding of their money,” explains Tagell. “So, we built a whole lot of features and a bunch of things that don’t necessarily make sense if all you need to do is have a bucket to hold your money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up allows its customers to create an unlimited number of savings accounts that can be named and dedicated to whatever they want to save for. In the spirit of taking risks and making bets around customer experience, they provide emojis to attach to each saver account and a gyroscopic “wave” animation that fills the screen you add to your savings. Quite frankly, it’s totally unneccesary. But it works. It engages customers and encourages them to save. What’s more, it encourages them to tell others about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because the accounts are so visual, people have started to share the index of their savers. And sometimes, they scribble out the amount. Sometimes they don’t. Ultimately, the risk of doing something that most banks would consider a bit of a childish novelty has turned out to be really engaging,” says Tagell. “It’s what makes people go, okay, I know what this is for, and I’m going to contribute money to it regularly because I want that thing. It helps reduce reliance on credit. It means that people are saving for purchases in advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of examples of this kind of thinking littered throughout the Up product. From the “Round Ups” that put the extra cents from your purchases into a savings account to sophisticated and detailed tracking of your purchases that provide insight into where your money is going, the details are sweated on each feature and flourish to drive home the message that controlling your money and saving is achievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marketing in a product-led company&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are more likely to get divorced than open a new bank account,” Tagell tells me, perfectly summing up the challenges of marketing in the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tells me how stunning and distinctive brand creative is one way Up cuts through but admits they’re still trying to figure out the best mix of messaging to balance talking about “the shiny new things,” which they love, and the routine stuff that gives people confidence Up is a safe place to leave their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word of mouth referrals, the sign of a great product, and a key marketing instrument in PLG companies are still Up’s primary source of new customers. “Ultimately, referrals happen because what we’ve built helps people. Once people have used Up, they understand that one plus one equals three and go and tell their friends about it,” says Tagell. “The goal of all of our marketing is to help our customers understand how everything fits together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, Tagell and his team certainly know where their audiences are. Though he tells me Up is for everyone, the brand feels undeniably young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozo.com.au/neobanks/articles/up-teams-up-with-tiktok-to-release-australia-s-first-ever-gamified-tiktok-effect&quot;&gt;Up brought their message to the social media app TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. A place more famous for twerking videos than banking, TikTok presented a big opportunity for the neobank to connect with younger customers. Up ran a campaign called “Easy Money,” the first-ever Australian branded Gamified Effect. The effect gave anyone on the TikTok platform the chance to play a 30 second game, munching as many coins as they could to potentially win $1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The TikTok thing was obvious for us, a lot of our customers are quite young, and one of the places that young people are at the moment is on TikTok,” explains Tagell. “We’re happy to experiment with things like that, which again, are not what a normal bank would do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine this with activities like sponsoring PAX, one of the world’s largest gaming conferences, and the Melbourne International Film festival. You begin to see how Up can use its differentiated brand to slide into spaces that banks would struggle to exist in authentically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Up and away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the little details that go a long way in today’s crowded markets. Up has shown that differentiation doesn’t need to be difficult, but it does mean taking risks. And beyond that, we’re giving a shoutout to Up because their customer experience is so focused and their product and service deliver on the hype. And at Dovetail and Outlier, we appreciate useful things—products that serve a purpose and solve real problems in simple, ingenious, and fun ways. While I can’t imagine going out of my way to praise banks of all businesses, particularly on innovation, Up is exceptional and a valuable addition to an old and often stale institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are there any products or services that offer an amazing, ingenious, and innovative customer experience that you think we should write about?

The smell, and the impact, is real. And we love it.” - Phoebe Gardner, Co-Founder of Bardee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes climate change. And we all know that greenhouse gas emissions are a problem. What may not be so obvious is where it all comes from (Hint: it’s not just from cars and transportation, which only account for an estimated 15 to 20 percent). To the chagrin of Tesla-driving vegans everywhere, the aggregate activities of food production make up anywhere from 21 to 37 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions for which humans are responsible. It gets worse too. More than 30 percent of food ends up wasted, and of that 30 percent, 70 percent of the wasting&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;happens before those tasty meals hit our plates for consumption. Then, when all that wasted food hits the landfills and rots, it produces methane, a greenhouse gas more than 30 times stronger than CO2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bardee.com/&quot;&gt;Bardee&lt;/a&gt;, a company turning food waste into protein-rich feed for dogs, cats, chickens, and fish. They also make fertilizer. For every tonne of food waste they divert from a landfill, 1.9 tonnes (nearly 2,000 kilograms) of carbon are offset. It’s vertical farming reimagined. Using Black Soldier Flies, food waste, and a hell of a lot of ingenuity, Bardee tackles climate change and food waste in one go, killing two birds with one stone while creating tons of jobs in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, they’re way beyond the proof-of-concept stage. Headquartered in Melbourne with a team of 20-plus, they’ve racked up more than $5 million in funding from Blackbird and big-name investors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierelzinga/?originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;Didier Elzinga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/simongriffiths-founder/&quot;&gt;Simon Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;. At the company’s heart is a secret weapon. Her name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/phoebe-gardner/?originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;Phoebe Gardne&lt;/a&gt;r.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as her first years of university, Phoebe was already making a name for herself as a contender. She’s one of those rare Kanye types who would succeed at anything because of sheer grit, drive, and determination. She’s a fighter, a mover, a doer. As a fresher at the University of Melbourne, she won a big prize for her top marks. Three years later, diploma in hand, she was off to the races, working as an architect out of the Melbourne offices of distinguished English firm Arup. After two years of hard yards there and a brief stint at Wood &amp;amp; Grieve Engineers (now Stantec), Phoebe co-founded Bardee with her Partner, Alex Arnold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conceived first on a trip to Amsterdam, where the pair were looking for a way to harness recycled energy on a massive scale, the seedlings of Bardee were planted. “A billion flies later,” Phoebe noted enthusiastically, “that’s exactly what we’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-is-a-user-researcher/&quot;&gt;User Research&lt;/a&gt; professionals sometimes think of it as a field exclusive to software products. But it’s not. While UR is incredibly useful in the tech space, it’s an approach that works whenever you’re building anything for others—especially something physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phoebe herself said it best: “We’re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/user-research-agile/&quot;&gt;lean methodology&lt;/a&gt; (people sometimes forget that practice started in manufacturing, not software) and first principles thinking, inspired by companies like Tesla and Toyota, to get outsized results from tiny incremental changes to our vertical farming system. Instead of tweaking code, we’re tweaking our food waste recipes or maybe modifying a climate in one of our labs by a small amount. Watching the compounding effect of those tiny improvements has been awesome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further discussing Bardee’s approach, Gardner explained that she and her team “need to make sure our learning loop is fast, and our problem-solving is practical and creative.” Working with top talent around the globe on every stage of the end-to-end process—that’s exactly what she does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliant minds feed off of each other, and it’s often in the interdisciplinary rather than the siloed that we break through and are truly able to create out-of-the-box solutions to complex issues. Bringing together their joint backgrounds and experiences, Phoebe and Alex are a powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Architecture is the art and science of creating spaces, and in the words of Australian Architect Glenn Murcutt, we should all try to ‘touch this earth lightly,” Phoebe stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bringing that lens to designing a vertical farming system, with Alex, who’s trained as an entomologist (bug scientist), gave us a pretty unique blend of skills—and we’ve drawn from both backgrounds to design what (in our view) is much more than the sum of its parts.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phoebe and Alex have big plans and hope to continue growing exponentially. “In 10 years’ time, we would hope to see Bardee facilities transforming a majority percentage of food waste in every city of the world—ten thousand facilities,” she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/business/entrepreneurship/it-s-a-bugs-life-aussie-startup-enlists-insect-army-to-tackle-food-waste-20211116-p599bj.html&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Emma Koehn in a recent interview with the &lt;i&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this may seem overly optimistic, Bardee just might get there. There are a few other companies in the space right now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goterra.com.au/&quot;&gt;Goterra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://entosystem.com/en/&quot;&gt;Entosystem&lt;/a&gt; among them. But it’s by no means an oversaturated market. It may well soon become one, though. If and when that happens, Bardee will have a leg-up for the simple reason that they got there first. And because they have something no one else does: Phoebe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Honoring the non-research perspective]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/honoring-non-research-perspective</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/honoring-non-research-perspective</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;UX researchers—we have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have an incredibly challenging role, especially when working for a company that’s new to our way of thinking. Our job comes with a big ask: We’re requesting that our non-research colleagues to question their expertise and reconsider the way they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a problem because the success of &lt;i&gt;our &lt;/i&gt;work is 100 percent tied to how well non-research colleagues embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be a cultural problem within our discipline. A divide between research (or the academic variety, anyway) and “the real world” has existed for centuries. My first career was in academia, where since the 1800s, the term “ivory tower” has been used to describe academic research practices as disconnected and irrelevant to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, UX research is not academic research. Our presence in a company is proof of research’s perceived relevance. Our existence represents the hope that there’s a solution to an organization’s biggest problem—not understanding their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet we have a disconnect. A disconnect that, in my view, is a major reason for the trend to democratize research, to throw open the curtain and allow the audience backstage to tinker with the lighting, the set, and the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t the research we do. We are experts at research design. The problem is how we communicate the entirety of our process to our stakeholders. By “entirety,” I’m not only referring to our craft. I’m also thinking about who we decide to hire and how we make these decisions. I’m thinking about how we communicate our sometimes slow research rhythm to our stakeholders, who often work at a quicker, agile pace. Perhaps most importantly, it’s how we share our insights, make sure they land, and whether we clearly assist our stakeholders in making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to talk about democratization of research, at least in terms of training non-researchers to do research work. Rather, I’d like to focus on three areas where we can make an impact by empathizing and educating others about how we perform research. Our potential impact, in other words, begins by honoring the non-research perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we hire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiring is all about bringing new researchers to our teams. To help ease our workloads. Build out our research function to support more of the company. That’s it, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong! That’s not it. Interviewing potential new UX researchers is a great moment to open a dialogue with relevant stakeholders about how we work and what our work involves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people your future researcher will work with most closely should be present at their interview. This is stage zero of stakeholder buy-in: Ensuring that the stakeholders feel they have a say in who will join the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, being “present” in the interview isn’t the goal. Participating in the interview process allows non-research colleagues to express their understanding of what the researcher is coming on board to do. For example, if they expect a researcher will only conduct evaluative research and you planned for a focus on long-term generative research, now is the time to communicate this. It’s also a moment to share your definition and vision for UX research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are the hiring manager: Schedule a brief meeting with each stakeholder attending the interview. Find out what their assumptions are about the future scope of this researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use this meeting to align your vision to the scope. Companies are often short-staffed when it comes to researchers, so it may be that this team has a different expectation of the focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a misalignment will rear its ugly head during the interview. Don’t shy away from working through this. (Bonus benefit: This is your potential future hire’s front-row seat to how you handle conflict.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-hire, this alignment is important to repeat regularly, especially for the researcher who’s joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe more specifically, our working rhythms. I hinted about this in my last point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk agile. Research is not always agile, but we often work with agile enthusiasts. Here’s a scenario I’ve seen again and again: Researchers join a company. There is no candid discussion about what these researchers will actually do, so everyone assigns their own definition to the researcher’s work, including their working rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is initial pushback on research because the work they want to do is not aligned with an agile workflow. Since researchers usually sit in product, your agile enthusiast stakeholders could recover from their initial enthusiasm, shrug their shoulders, and give up. They say: researchers have convinced us they need time. But, if research doesn’t work agile, how can we work with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, this is our problem to solve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some tips:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the hiring process: When you interview for a new role, even if you are the twentieth researcher hired at the company, make sure you and your stakeholders are aligned on what you will actually do as a researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with your manager and stakeholders, determine the rhythm of your work. Some low-key evaluative projects can indeed fit into a sprint. Others will take longer and therefore need to be planned accordingly. Not just the research but also the insights sharing and the solution brainstorm &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after you join the company, there will be moments of misalignment. Coming back to a shared understanding of what your job entails or how it could evolve is always a good starting point for working through these issues  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How we share&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we sit comfortably in the problem space. We are trained to finesse our stakeholder’s questions into answerable research questions. We are a master at research craft. We spend time analyzing our data and crafting insights that we hope are understandable and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a scenario I’ve seen many times: A researcher completes a project, presents insights, leaves five minutes at the end to answer questions, and then moves on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In UX research, it doesn’t matter how brilliantly you crafted your project. If these insights don’t connect with your stakeholders, it doesn’t matter if you are addressing a relevant question or you’re enthusiastic about your insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you doing to ensure that your insights land?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s return to that empathy-then-education model. Start by aligning with your stakeholders about the answerability of their question and what they can expect from the insights (I cover this extensively in my article, The Baton Handover: making insights actionable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A few tips:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take time to confront your potential fear of moving stakeholders into the solution space. Maybe you’re not sure how the research will be actionable. Or how far you’ll be expected to go into the solution space. Spend time writing down what scares you about this process. Then, connect with your stakeholders and share your concerns openly. This is a great way to build a trusting relationship that will facilitate this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start every research project scoping meeting with a look back at past projects you completed with this stakeholder. Don’t conduct a full retro—that should have already happened. Ask them to reflect on past projects’ relevance and how these insights still play into their current work and questions. This situates research as more of a body of work than a disconnected project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the lines of communication to see how you can best accommodate the solution space. What do your stakeholders expect from the current project? What will they do with the insights? How can you help to ensure this process is successful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, the responsibility ultimately lies with us to make this insights thing work. It’s a huge responsibility on top of our project work, our setting up of research operations, and the time we need to spend first empathizing and then educating others on our craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll end by stating what I said earlier: Our potential impact begins by honoring the non-research perspective.

What are you working on these days?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently begun the next step, which is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; on those people who are trying to help product teams, product leaders, and product companies. I refer to that as “coaching the coaches,” and it’s an acknowledgment that far more teams and companies need help than there are people with the knowledge and experience to provide that help. So, we’re trying to do our part to address that problem. We are starting by helping to develop a network of coaches in Europe but hope to take that to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What was the general thesis of INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and what do you hope people take away from those books?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;INSPIRED&lt;/i&gt; is all about product discovery, which is how a cross-functional product team discovers a solution worth building—a valuable, usable, feasible, and viable solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; EMPOWERED&lt;/i&gt; is all about product leadership, which provides the necessary coaching and strategic context to the product teams, including the product vision, product strategy, team topology, and team objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I hope people take away from both books is that the best product companies in the world produce products in ways that are very different from most companies and that it’s not an accident that they are also the most valuable companies in the world. And most importantly, there’s no reason you can’t change to work like the best companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How do you retain customers in an atomized world where their options are seemingly infinite?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the bar is higher today than it has ever been, and customers have more choices than ever before. But despite the crowded playing field, the key is to truly take care of your customers and not worry so much about competitors. It’s remarkable how many companies I meet that give lip service to caring about their customers but, unfortunately, have little idea of what it means to truly work to continuously innovate on behalf of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Talk to me about the importance of qualitative user research.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every good product team I know uses both quantitative and qualitative techniques. They are both critical because they answer different questions. The quantitative techniques tell us what’s actually happening (good or bad), but they can’t tell us why. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques/&quot;&gt;qualitative techniques&lt;/a&gt; help us learn what’s wrong with our products and provide great inspiration for how to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What advice and tips do you have for PMs looking to better understand their customers?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher-order point is that if you are doing user-facing products, you need a steady cadence of getting in front of your customers. Normally, that means the product manager, product designer, and at least one of the engineers spend at least an hour each with three different users or customers every week. We combine this with quantitative techniques (such as running A/B tests to see which solution approach performs best).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;You advocate for PMs to do user research each week. Some would argue that this may not be possible for early-stage companies with limited resources. What would you say to them?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If resources are limited (especially time and money), then that makes this work especially critical, as it’s all about learning quickly. It’s much faster than older approaches where someone would just take a guess and then spend months to build, QA test, and deploy, only to find out customers didn’t want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is important that product teams pace themselves. I often find teams spending way too much time validating that customers actually have the problem (even when the evidence is clear) and not nearly enough time figuring out if customers will actually buy their approach to solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cut to the chase, what’s really hard about product is coming up with a solution that is so much better than the alternatives that the customer is willing to switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s your opinion of lean research? And what do you say to those that argue this approach leads to cherry-picking or biased results?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no question this is a real problem in some companies. I’ve seen product managers working without a trained product designer or user researcher, and also not including their engineers (but that’s a different issue), and just going nowhere fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I advocate a compromise that is used at many strong product companies. These companies have a relatively small number of professional user researchers to coach and enable the product teams to do good product discovery work every week. Realize that this model depends on having professional product designers on these teams, and also realize that most professional product designers have had some level of training in user research. So the combination is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out the problem on the other extreme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In several old-school companies, professional user researchers do all user research, and months later (literally), the product team gets a report that they rarely even read, let alone pay attention to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because they weren’t there learning firsthand. I tell user researchers that their work is too important to be ignored, and they need to enable the product teams to learn directly if they want to have a real impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;You’ve talked about “intercept testing” in the past, where you essentially get real-time feedback from people already using a product. Could you elaborate on this?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we love intercept testing and have done it for many years, but today the tooling makes this easier than ever. The concept is simple. If we are building an app to help someone book a table at a restaurant, you could go to pretty much any adult and ask them if they’re ever booked a table at a restaurant before, and if so, could they please pretend to do that now so we can see how well our app solves that problem. However, if we can get people that are actually in the process of booking a table, the learnings will be much more valuable. In the first, the focus is usually on usability. In the second, you quickly get to the tougher issue of value— would they really use this to book a table?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One use of user research firms is to recruit users, and of course, with intercept testing, that process is essentially automated. But the actual running of the test and interpreting the learnings is where the user research skills are still critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Talk to me about some methods for continuous product discovery. Why do many PMs neglect this, and why is that a mistake?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, product discovery is only relevant if the product team is empowered to actually come up with the solution. Sadly, most companies are not working like the best companies, so they don’t empower their teams. Instead, many stakeholders, executives, or even customers (which is why we hate focus groups) tell us what features they want us to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In which case, all the product team is asked to do is design and implement that feature, build and QA test that feature, then deploy that feature. We call these feature teams because it’s all about delivering features and projects on a roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product discovery is necessary when we are instead given a problem to solve, and now the product team has to figure out a solution that will actually solve that problem. And that requires considering the various risks—value, usability, feasibility, and viability—and testing out different approaches until we discover one worth building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Researchers sometimes feel like they’re ignored and don’t have a meaningful seat at the table. How can they improve their relationships with PMs and other stakeholders?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is shared learning. Unless the actual product team—the PM, the product designer, and the engineers—learns the issues firsthand, they will not act on those learnings. So the key for user research is to enable that shared learning. Not to do the research for the team, and not let the team go off and struggle to do the research themselves. But rather to work with the product team to coach and enable them to do good research every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What advice do you have for young entrepreneurs just getting their start?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many great places to start—I started as an engineer and have benefited from that to this day. Product design is a fantastic role and is in very high demand. Product management can be a stressful role, but it’s where many entrepreneurs learn the critical skills that eventually lead to running a startup. User research is a great place to develop true customer-centricity. Data analytics and data science are some of the fastest-growing areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why do you love what you do?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love building things, and today, almost everything is powered by technology. And the enabling technology changes literally every day. So every day, new things become possible. I think any other career would have been boring compared to that.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From lamps to playgrounds, Isamu Noguchi believed sculpture should be omnipresent]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/from-lamps-to-playgrounds-isamu-noguchi-believed-sculpture-should-be</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/from-lamps-to-playgrounds-isamu-noguchi-believed-sculpture-should-be</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[UX research is vital to energy transitions]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/ux-research-is-vital-to-energy-transitions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/ux-research-is-vital-to-energy-transitions</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is a phrase from an academic paper that has lived in my mind rent-free since my master’s degree in digital anthropology nearly half a decade ago. Most people get songs stuck in their heads—for me, it’s niche philosophical takeaways from PDFs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the phrase: &lt;i&gt;“When is an infrastructure?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is simple and jarring, a poetic summons to reconsider an impenetrable word: infrastructure. Not what, but &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt;. This phrase comes from a 1996 paper written by Susan Leigh Star and Karen Ruhleder in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/192844.193021&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Information Systems Research&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Two-and-a-half decades later, their foresight and broad understanding of how online communities are built into our daily lives and businesses as infrastructure still delight and surprise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now a little past the brink of a defining era for energy, with massive infrastructural, technological, and social changes afoot—much of which will be digitally mediated. The political will and technological capability for energy transitions are beginning to coincide, and we are witnessing entire industries emerge around this transition. As an anthropologist and UXR, the first question I’m wont to ask is: what does this mean for &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;? Perhaps it’s trite to argue for our own profession, but I don’t mind preaching to the choir. Still, my thesis is that we, as UXRs, designers, product managers, and social scientists, have an essential role to play in helping businesses and institutions navigate this transition. Because it’s never just about the infrastructure, it’s the people who interact with it. A beehive doesn’t build itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So&lt;i&gt;—when is an infrastructure? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academic duo lists a few defining moments for how software and communities morph into infrastructures. And this is where the magic happens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infrastructure is &lt;i&gt;learned &lt;/i&gt;as part of membership”—not just built but &lt;i&gt;learned &lt;/i&gt;and reiterated by the people who use it. This forecast into the importance of membership is spot on. Take the fierce debates between Apple and Android users. Are you just a user, or are you a &lt;i&gt;member &lt;/i&gt;of a community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice,” and here the authors start talking about fluctuating electricity demands—I’m returning to this later because it’s relevant to the point I am going to make about electricity consumption habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this third is my favorite: &lt;i&gt;“Infrastructure&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;becomes visible upon breakdown.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phrase whispers itself in my mind each time something goes wrong. &lt;i&gt;When&lt;/i&gt; the supermarket shelves were laid bare at the beginning of the pandemic, each month &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; I get my alarming electricity bill, &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; I got locked out of my PayPal account last week because it was hooked up to my teenage email address. Suddenly the infrastructures taken for granted are not only visible but physically and emotionally tangible, the source and subject of moments of incredible frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; systems stop working the way that we expect them to? Hopefully, though not necessarily, we change our behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When did users start caring about energy infrastructure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a digital anthropologist, I spent the past three years tailing climate and sustainability activists in the UK and Norway. I witnessed how digital technologies helped transform underlying beliefs and understandings of sustainability challenges facing society were transforming. Flitting seamlessly between varying social media apps, activists used the context of the city to stage virtually streamed theatrical protests, ultimately transforming how many people, politicians included, talk about climate change. The demonstrations undeniably sparked new and broad-reaching narratives about the climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, top-down ideas in academia, policy, and industry have emerged. One example is that of a circular economy. Ideas and policies for leveraging design practices and consumer behavior to create resource loops and reuse raw materials are gaining traction in many sectors, including those within the digital sphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several circular economy apps and platforms in the UK and Scandinavia have surfaced for reusing and redistributing waste, particularly within the building and textile sectors. And in April this year, the UK government released its energy security strategy paper. While the government has committed to more oil in the near future, there are significant commitments to roll out other energy sources: offshore wind, solar, hydrogen, and nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, EVs are high on the UK’s agenda, along with zero emissions air and maritime technology. Far from perfect, these rollouts are fraught with tensions, massive trade-offs, and risk exacerbating social injustices. Nonetheless, change is underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Visible changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s quite something to drive through the suburbs in London and start to see solar panels on people’s rooftops. These new energy interventions look strange but are something we will inevitably get used to and eventually hardly notice once they are in smooth working order. Very visible infrastructure, particularly onshore wind, has already been the cause of outrage for some communities, while others have jumped at the opportunity to build renewable energy cooperatives. The scientific consensus is that society cannot continue to run on fossil fuels. Still—the ruptures caused by these new energy infrastructures appear alien and affect different communities in varying ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we can expect new behaviors right down to the level of the individual as energy systems transform. For instance, there is the possibility that people will begin to trade renewable energy using cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This is called peer-to-peer energy trading, where households produce and store their own energy at a small scale—in industry and academia, this is called &lt;i&gt;prosumption&lt;/i&gt;. This topic is worth a whole other blog post, but I use this example to illustrate the digital infrastructures that might find their way into the average users’ homes and hands sooner than we think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And other changes are pending too. The way we interact with other resources besides energy is shifting. For example, people might change to a vegan diet and so change the way they shop online and search for recipes. They might decide to shop second-hand using an app, or perhaps they will learn to sew through an online community ed-tech platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;i&gt;we &lt;/i&gt;know&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;that an app or consumer-facing concept that fails to place the user at its center causes unnecessarily painful uptake. The challenge is not just to build new green-sounding apps but to help people understand these changing values and technological norms and, in turn, understand how consumer values are also transforming across cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The strengths of the UXR&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The context for doing business is changing rapidly. The pandemic and climate change have already challenged the cultural cognitive scripts we live by. Further, the policy landscape in which companies operate is transforming. There are many challenges to be addressed and mediated by digital technologies—from coordinating city planning for more circular urban environments to rolling out new energy infrastructure for disparate energy communities around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everywhere, the local contexts for these transformations will present unique challenges, especially for uniformly designed sustainability solutions built by global companies. Like Star and Ruhleder wrote all those years ago—infrastructure is &lt;i&gt;learned &lt;/i&gt;and made culturally relevant by its members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, people have the opportunity to have a greater say in how we design these infrastructures. We have methods and technology to make communication between companies, governments, and citizens much more of a two-way street. We can’t achieve an energy transformation of this scale without the user’s trust, nor will it be possible without access to excellent online education, regardless of whether the technological capability and political will are there. This is where user research plays a valuable role: in its ability to understand people’s ever-changing needs, beliefs, frustrations, and contexts. We must &lt;i&gt;listen. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UXRs and applied social scientists are in an excellent position. They understand the need to balance stakeholder and business requirements with those of the user and customer. Now, we need these skills to take us beyond the happy lands of theory and into the thorny realm of the practical. The businesses that nail this transition will be those willing to take honest feedback from designers or researchers when a product isn’t meeting a user’s need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when is an excellent time for even more user researchers and social scientists to engage with the people and organizations creating the tech for change? Now.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Playing isn’t a waste of time]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/playing-isnt-a-waste-of-time</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/playing-isnt-a-waste-of-time</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As we get older, a lot of societies, education systems, and workplaces make us feel that playing is a waste of time. &lt;u&gt;We end up suppressing stupidly brilliant questions&lt;/u&gt; for what we think are more serious responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to be a games user researcher with Steve Bromley]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-to-be-a-games-user-researcher-with-steve-bromley</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/how-to-be-a-games-user-researcher-with-steve-bromley</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Steve Bromley has one of the coolest sounding jobs out there. It’s one of those gigs like professional food taster, chocolate consultant, or tropical island caretaker—that as soon as we hear of its improbable existence, we’re immediately sent into a kind of despair. Like we’ve been hoodwinked by curmudgeonly career advisors into a lifetime of drudgery while someone out there is eating chocolate for a living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromley doesn’t scoff Lindt in his day-to-day, but to many, his job—Games User Researcher—sounds just as sweet. And there’s good news. While Bromley may have one of those too-good-to-be-true-sounding roles, he isn’t gatekeeping it. The opposite—Bromley, the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamesuserresearch.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to be a Games User Researcher&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; wants to tell you how to live the dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you start rearranging that CV, read on—we’re not only covering what it takes to be a games user researcher. We’ll also be taking a broad look at the state of user research in gaming and tackling some of the challenges researchers are facing in the industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to be a games user researcher&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bromley, there are three major areas you need to cover if you’re considering a career in the industry. You need to understand:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How games are made&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to run playtests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to apply and interview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How games are made&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are definite similarities in the way games and traditional products are made, the differences truly define the games user research profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a games designer differs quite dramatically from a product designer. “The term game designer covers a whole bunch of different disciplines,” says Bromley. “From people who are crafting the puzzles and crafting levels or activities players do to more systems designers who are thinking about the core loop of the game—which is understanding what the player has to do with every part of the game and how it all joins together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the specialty, games designers spend a lot of their time thinking about all the different moving parts in the game. In the product world, the closest parallel, says Bromley, is a service designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the primary stakeholder in a games user researcher’s life is a producer—akin to a product manager in the traditional product world. “Producers have a very good overview of the timeline, what things are coming on board at which point and when, and when are good times to test,” says Bromley. “And then, as user researchers, we need to find the relevant designers and ask them about the intended experience.” The goal, Bromley iterates to me, is to uncover the vision for that part of the game and understand how the designer expects the player to react. A games user researcher then does the research thing and turns this information into a series of hypotheses that can be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The art of playtesting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring a player reacts in the intended way to a specific experience is paramount to the game’s success. To ensure a designer’s creation is hitting the mark, the industry employs something called playtesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playtesting is what it sounds like: a real player will sit through some or all of a game and answer questions relating to its playability. If it sounds familiar, that’s because playtesting is the industry’s version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/usability-vs-preference/&quot;&gt;usability testing&lt;/a&gt;. But some very particular considerations make it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional products, games are released in one big bang. Tonnes of marketing spend is deployed in the lead up to the game’s release, and accordingly, there is a lot more pressure to get the game right first go. Incidentally, this is why Bromley believes so strongly in the part user research plays in the game’s success. Practically, this also means studios are very concerned about information leaking before the launch date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the methods we might use in product user research feel too unsafe for many games, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-running-unmoderated-tests/&quot;&gt;unmoderated testing&lt;/a&gt;,” says Bromley. “Someone playing at home can be difficult because you don’t know if they are recording their screen or something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of those risks, when we want to answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/mixed-methods-research/&quot;&gt;quant&lt;/a&gt; things, we need to bring them to us,” Bromley states. “So it’s very typical in a playtest lab for the big publishers to have 40, sometimes 80 gaming seats where we can have 80 participants at once just playing through the game, going through long campaigns or doing individual levels and surveys and analytics generated by the game to answer questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, with all that prep work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/what-is-researchops/&quot;&gt;ResearchOps&lt;/a&gt; plays a significant role in games user research. Not only in the gargantuan effort it takes to get 80 participants in a room simultaneously (shout out to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/the-characteristics-of-top-researchops-practitioners/&quot;&gt;ResearchOps people&lt;/a&gt;! If you know, you know!), but also in the screening of said participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Gamers are] a very engaged audience, and everyone wants to see secret things and talk about secret things. Lots of people would like to participate in the research,” says Bromley. A typical product research session isn’t likely to be the most exciting thing our participants have done that day. Usually, the reward is financial or social. But in games user research, taking part can be the highlight of the month or even year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants falling over themselves to get access sounds like a dream—but Bromley aptly points out that extra rigor must be taken in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/participant-recruitment-101-with-user-interviews-vp-of-product-john-henry/&quot;&gt;screening process &lt;/a&gt;to ensure no time wasters slip through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where’s the industry at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While playtesting sounds like the obvious domain of an experienced user researcher, the industry hasn’t quite matured to the point where employing professional user researchers is widespread. According to Bromley, this means that playtesting exists as an idea, but it’s still in its nascent stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Playtesting can mean a whole bunch of different things in different studios, especially because user research and UX isn’t that established in games,” Bromley reveals. “The definition does vary from, ‘I am a game designer, and I play my game, and I see if I like it. And if I do like it, I give it a thumbs up,’ which, obviously, coming from a research discipline, we know that’s subject to human biases. You’re playing your own thing. You haven’t defined your criteria. You’re just deciding, does this feel right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting widespread adoption research is one of Bromley’s strongest points of advocacy. He acknowledges that part of the difficulty is that “unlike product development, games are considered art.” To many games designers, the idea of a researcher coming in and telling them how their game should operate smacks of interference and a watering down of their creative vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromley approaches this barrier with candor. His response is an amazing template for anyone looking to further the cause of user research with skeptical stakeholders. “As user researchers, we make sure we’re aware that the games are art. And we say, we’re not here to change your vision. We’re not doing market research to tell you what game to make. Instead, we want to understand your vision and make sure it’s being understood by players correctly and that there isn’t an interpretation gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think the fear is user research will be getting a focus group together. And participants will say, ‘I don’t like this game,’ and lots of opinion-based things rather than behavioral measurements against the intended experience. This means game designers don’t engage with user research until quite late in the development period or when our ideal process would begin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of games as art isn’t prevalent at all studios, says Bromley. In particular, the booming mobile “games as a service” industry seems to have a more product-forward approach to development. Nevertheless, getting buy-in early for research remains a challenge for many user researchers in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bromley seems confident in the headway he and other researchers have made over the years and remains optimistic about the future potential of user research in games. “We’re professionalizing research and bringing in the expertise that user researchers elsewhere have to help make tests more efficient, more reliable, and ultimately better for making game design decisions. There are also really interesting nuances of doing it in games that you don’t see in other industries. It’s a fascinating industry for a user researcher to work in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get the job&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re already a good candidate if you understand playtesting and grasp how games are made. But there are a few more considerations for those who might be interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, geography. No, not the subject, but rather where you live or would be willing to live. “[Games user research roles] are very geographically specific to hubs like London, San Francisco, or Canada,” Bromley tells me. “There can be a lot of competition for the roles because a lot of people want to work in games. It’s a very prestigious industry, and there aren’t many roles out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the competition, those who stand the best chance of entering would bring a fair bit of experience. While there are many junior roles available, there’s also a lot of demand for those roles. While at the top end, many senior games user researchers are drawn out of the industry into the tech world. This leaves room for experienced researchers to enter somewhere in the middle or top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to enter as a junior, Bromley’s best advice? Work on your interviewing skills. “What are the skills you need to demonstrate? How can you get the experience, and how can you demonstrate those skills?” he posits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;User research and creativity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our earlier conversation about game designers, their creative vision, and auteurial control over development has me thinking. Particularly regarding designers’ skepticism toward research—could they be right? Is user research even compatible with creativity? Or does it, in fact, lead to a kind of design by committee—a camel instead of a horse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromley believes wholeheartedly that user research is compatible with creativity. “The critical part as user researchers is that we need to &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; the creative vision. We need to put hard work into talking to designers and understand what they think they’re making and how players should receive it. And then treat that as the hypothesis for what we’re testing against,” states Bromley. Rather than changing the vision, he says it’s supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Bromley, it doesn’t end there. He believes the future of user research in games is to be true collaborators in the creative decision-making process. In Bromley’s words, “Helping people recognize how a better understanding of users can inform their creative vision—but that’s a battle for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the old chestnut about horses and camels? Bromley leaves me with a neat little rejoinder on the matter. “I think we need to find a way to communicate to designers, ‘Hey, we’re not going to tell you to make a camel. We understand you want to make a horse. We’re going to investigate: Where does that horse need to go, when does it need to get there, who’s going on the horse? All the things that would help you design the horse appropriately so that you’re still in control of it, but you understand the context in which that horse has to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Games User Research sounds like a blast?

The chef high-key understood the assignment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Say less, it’s hitting different. The pepperonis are gas—&lt;i&gt;no cap&lt;/i&gt;!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bet, this place slaps. We’re vibing. Sheeeesh!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to forget this exchange from last year. I was dining out with friends when we simultaneously stopped our chatter to hear this remarkable conversation play out. We couldn’t help but smile as we attempted to decipher what sounded like a foreign language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick search revealed that these sayings are common terminology for Gen Z, the term coined to describe anyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/&quot;&gt;born in 1997 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt; While this manner of speech might seem amusing to Millenials (those born between 1981 and 1996) and older, research indicates this current generation should be taken very seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They make up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/retail-courts-gen-z-spending-power-over-140-billion-2020-1&quot;&gt;40% of global consumers with a spending power of $140 billion&lt;/a&gt; and are on track to become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z&quot;&gt;largest cohort of consumers by 2026&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/&quot;&gt;highest educated generation eve&lt;/a&gt;r. With Gen Z serving as the first true group of Digital Natives—having grown up with digital technology their whole lives—perhaps it’s time we begin examining their implications on user research and explore how we might adapt our craft to their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who are Gen Z?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from being born in a particular age range, what key characteristics do individuals from Gen Z possess? Firstly, very high levels of savviness—and dependency—with technology. Particularly when it comes to social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Take in these Gen Z statistics that &lt;a href=&quot;https://99firms.com/blog/generation-z-statistics/#gref&quot;&gt;99 Firms has drawn from IBM, the Global Web Index, Pew Research, and more:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gen Z spends an average of eight hours online per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;95 percent of teens own or have access to a smartphone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;55 percent use their smartphones for five hours or more per day (26 percent for more than 10 hours per day)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;65 percent use their phones after midnight more than once per week (29 percent are on their smartphones after midnight every night)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, they are pragmatic, financially-minded, and shrewd consumers, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aecf.org/blog/what-are-the-core-characteristics-of-generation-z&quot;&gt;Annie E. Casey Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a charitable foundation focused on improving the well-being of children established in 1948. Gen Z-ers are typically careful spenders and thoughtful investors who seek stable jobs. They lean on social networks for exploration and evaluation when making a purchase decision. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hootsuite.com/generation-z-statistics-social-marketers/&quot;&gt;Hootsuite&lt;/a&gt; states that 85 percent of Gen Z learns about new products via social media. Many are also entrepreneurial, leading to the rise of side hustles such as Etsy stores or creating social media channels as both a creative outlet and means to generate income. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate theme among Gen Z is a feeling of overwhelm, stress, and anxiety. In a 2019 interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/09/8489331/greta-thunberg-gen-zs-quest-to-save-the-world&quot;&gt;Refinery 29&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. B. Janet Hibbs states, “In the past year, 91 percent of Gen Z experienced one or more emotional or physiological stress-related symptoms.” However, many embrace frequent communication to build a sense of interconnectedness. They also champion diversity as an important value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did these characteristics come to be? Many of Gen Z’s shared behaviors can be attributed to consistent Internet access from a young age (more than half of children in the US own a smartphone by age 11 per &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/10/29/774306250/report-more-than-half-of-u-s-children-now-own-a-smartphone-by-age-11&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;) alongside the meteoric rise of social networks. The digital world has been a key aspect of their lives from a young age and has become ingrained in their daily habits. Seeing the struggles of loved ones during life-changing events such as The Great Recession and the Housing Crisis of 2008 likely left lasting impressions as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diving deeper with qualitative research&lt;b&gt;   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While statistics from quantitative survey data provide insight into Gen Z’s behavior, the spirit of user research inspired me to conduct interviews with four Gen Z individuals (three females and one male aged 18 - 22). The aim was to learn more about their expectations and behaviors regarding technology. This led to nuanced discoveries about Gen Z’s tech usage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Constantly connected and technology-dependent—but not necessarily enjoying it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My conversations absolutely confirmed that Gen Z is attached to technology. All participants reported five or more hours of daily smartphone screen time and ten-plus hours of total screen time, including computer usage. However, all of them expressed a negative sentiment when describing their habits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a raging addict.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know I’m addicted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish I wasn’t that dependent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s BAD!”     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that high screen time results from a combination of: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Habits. &lt;/b&gt;Scrolling social media to keep up with friends and current events has become second nature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Necessity.&lt;/b&gt; Schooling and work rely heavily on technology and take place almost entirely online &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boredom. &lt;/b&gt;Especially during the pandemic. With no better options, the smartphone was a welcome escape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also elements of “background” screen time, such as navigating, viewing recipes, watching television on a smartphone instead of TV, and FaceTiming loved ones instead of phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The interview participants expressed a longing for alternatives to technology: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wished I spent more time outside. It’s hard to quit habits. I don’t want to check my phone constantly, but it’s hard not to. If I don’t, I feel intense FOMO!” (Fear of missing out) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; “My family lives hours away, so I’m not driving each time I want to talk to them. And for recipes, do you expect me to use books?!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for researching Gen Z versus previous generations&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the above in mind, here are some take homes for you to consider next time you find yourself confronted with a research project involving Gen Z. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understand the assignment &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Gen Z phrase refers to an individual who perfectly plays their role and accomplishes a goal with great success. As user researchers, our jobs lead us to conduct research in unfamiliar fields. Studying our users and their context is pivotal to crafting meaningful interview scripts or usability test protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding our users often means performing research and connecting with subject matter experts beforehand to comprehend the space better. The same can be said of preparing to conduct research with Gen Z. Reading articles like this that highlight the distinct characteristics of this generation and studying their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/e/gen-z-slang/&quot;&gt;slang&lt;/a&gt; can go a long way in preparing for a research session and ensuring it runs smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Go deeper with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/mixed-methods-research/&quot;&gt;mixed methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When time and resources allow, supplementing quantitative research with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/qualitative-research-methods-techniques/&quot;&gt;qualitative techniques&lt;/a&gt; can yield more &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/research-report-recommendations-examples/&quot;&gt;actionable findings&lt;/a&gt;. For example: combine &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/analyze-open-ended-survey-questions/&quot;&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; or usage logs with interviews, observations, or diary studies. Recommendations based on an incomplete perspective could result in lackluster outcomes. In the case of this article, primary interviews to supplement statistics from secondary research provided a clearer picture of why Gen Z relies on technology and the negative sentiments that many feel towards this dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Make research engaging and non-disruptive&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up as digital natives, Gen Z seems to possess high expectations for digital experiences. Whether it’s an app, social media platform, or website, the experience needs to be polished, entertaining, and minimally invasive. The same holds true with research. Whether in-person or remote research, ensure that you’ve tested your protocol and prototypes to ensure everything works as intended. Gen Z is also used to enthralling social media videos, so if possible, make the session exciting and engaging as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Becoming the main character&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one final Gen Z phrase that describes becoming the protagonist, aka “main character” within your story. We’ve touched on my aspects of this special generation: from the well-advertised technology usage to their desire to feel more connected. With a further understanding of their qualities, it’s your turn to think about what things you might (and might not) do differently when conducting research with this current generation. We know you’ll do great and can’t wait to hear your insights on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/community/&quot;&gt;Dovetail’s Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trust issues: the quest to design accountable AI ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/accountable-ai</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/accountable-ai</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Andrew Ng, co-founder of Google’s AI research lab, Google Brain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc&quot;&gt;compared the transformative power of AI to that of electricity&lt;/a&gt;, and I think he’s right. I can’t imagine any industry that won’t continue to benefit from the tidal wave of innovation in AI. And—like electricity—AI is now part of the infrastructure of our lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the co-founder of the Designing with AI Lab (DWAIL) at The University of Sydney, one of my missions is to equip designers with the knowledge they need to design complex AI-driven systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe this is important because when designers and engineers fail to estimate the potential of AI-driven systems, unintentional and counterintuitive outcomes can have huge impacts on people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example of AI-driven decision-making gone wrong comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing&quot;&gt;ProPublica’s exposé &lt;/a&gt;on the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm. COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a predictive tool used to assess how likely a criminal defendant will commit another crime. ProPublica’s analysis uncovered that COMPAS would wrongly label Black defendants as future criminals at almost twice the rate as white defendants. This should never have happened, so why did it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When AI-driven decision-making fails, it’s common to find two key drivers: a lack of accountability in the decision-making process and overconfidence in AI-made decisions. Together they create a heady mixture of opinionated, un-auditable, and seemingly trustworthy outcomes. Because of this, there has been a push for more “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/watson/explainable-ai&quot;&gt;explainable AI&lt;/a&gt;,” championed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pair.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Big Tech&lt;/a&gt; and leading institutions like MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), who are calling for greater transparency and understanding of machine behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe if we equip designers and engineers with both more knowledge about the limitations of AI and better principles for designing systems that use AI-driven decision-making, we can avoid the pitfalls of unaccountability and overconfidence and, instead, build trustworthiness. To do this, I propose the following when designing AI-driven decision-making systems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trustworthiness = accountability + transparency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If AI systems are responsible for making predictive decisions about our lives, they must be trustworthy, and for that to occur, they must be both accountable and transparent. Accountable systems can be audited, or their decisions interrogated for consistency and bias. Transparent systems are ones where their decision-making processes are exposed, and the system’s limitations are clearly communicated. These two principles are key to the trustworthiness of any decision made by an AI system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if an AI system cannot be made accountable by audit or interrogation, what assurances do we have that bias does not exist? If none are given, then why should the public trust the decisions made by AI systems? Or, if the system’s limitations are unclear or the process by which a decision is made is opaque, how can we be confident in the system’s conclusions? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a new frontier for designers and engineers. It’s the perfect combination of socially significant and technologically complex. Unlocking the potential of AI decision-making rests on our ability to design trustworthiness into AI systems with accountability and transparency at their core. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most designers are familiar with traditional models of trust that are often based on Maslow’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/commitment-levels/&quot;&gt;hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;,” where users move from “no trust” towards “high trust” based on the presence of key indicators such as &lt;a href=&quot; https://www.nngroup.com/articles/communicating-trustworthiness/&quot;&gt;design quality and interconnectedness&lt;/a&gt;. But when it comes to designing with AI-based systems, it can become more complex than this. For example, most of the systems you interact with that use AI-based algorithms are hidden from you. They’re black boxes. You put something in, and something comes out, but what happens in between is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is when you search on Spotify for a “Sunday morning vibe” (for which the answer is &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; James Blake–“Retrograde”), and you’re presented with recommendations from the machine-ether. To do this, Spotify has analyzed every song in its database for danceability, instrumentalness, energy, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.atspotify.com/2015/03/09/understanding-spotify-web-api/&quot;&gt;countless more audio features&lt;/a&gt; to find you the closest match to your search terms. Yet this deeply rich dataset of millions of individually analyzed audio features is presented as a single text field to the user. In this example, Spotify relies on traditional indicators of trust such as consistency and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/social-proof-ux/&quot;&gt;social proofs&lt;/a&gt; to move a user towards a trustworthy experience. But users are missing out on a much richer experience, one that includes accountability and transparency of the algorithm itself as the drivers of trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore this idea using a core AI concept—&lt;i&gt;latent spaces&lt;/i&gt;. A latent space is a compressed and sorted representation of all the data the system is trained on. You can visualize a latent space like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system has sorted all the 1 into a group on the left, all the 2’s towards the bottom, and all the 0’s towards the right. These groupings are one way that Spotify’s algorithm finds your recommendations. If a song is like another, it will be closer in the latent space. If it’s different, it will be far away. This gets interesting when you try and pick a point in the middle. For example, what if I want a song that’s halfway between James Blake’s “Retrograde” and Ed Sheeran’s latest ear worm? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotify has over the years &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.spotify.com/community/showcase/&quot;&gt;supported a community&lt;/a&gt; of innovative product designers who are trying to take advantage of the capabilities of AI systems, like those that latent spaces allow for. From visualizing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotify-audio-analysis.glitch.me/analysis.html&quot;&gt;comparing song structures&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.spotify.com/community/showcase/artist-explorer-spotify/&quot;&gt;exploring the sonic relationships between artists&lt;/a&gt;, fostering experimentation with AI-driven systems sets the stage for making complex machine behaviors part of how a user can interact with Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of features have never made big waves in Spotify’s products and nor are they commonly found in other popular recommender-based systems. One of the reasons for this is that latent spaces are an example of an AI capability that designers struggle to have a clear vision for. But the key might be focusing on designing for trustworthiness. Let’s consider reframing Spotify’s search functionality. Instead of focusing on the correctness or quality of the system’s recommendations as the key driver for trust, what if we instead focused on &lt;i&gt;exploration &lt;/i&gt;as the driving principle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a focus on correctness, a recommender system like Spotify’s will take your input and return the most correct results to you, perhaps filtered by another measure of relevance based on your profile. It might look something like this:        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything the algorithm knows about the information you’re searching for is “black boxed,” filtered down into the most likely and relevant results, and returned to the user. This is an excellent model when correctness generates trustworthiness with the system—the fewer opportunities for the algorithm to be incorrect, the better. But we know from the example of COMPAS this comes with a trade-off. Black-boxed systems are inherently unaccountable and keep users from understanding the reasoning behind a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does an interaction with an AI-driven tool look like if we instead focus on explorability? You can imagine an interaction that looks more like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of interaction model is open to including users as active participants in deciphering the outcomes of a search. It presents the results of a query contextualized in their latent space alongside less relevant information. Doing so increases the system’s transparency while also offering an opportunity for AI-driven decisions to be interrogated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with black-boxed systems, there is a trade-off. Systems like this are inherently more complex to interact with, and representing a latent space is not always straightforward. Despite this, the model opens up exciting possibilities for recentering the design of AI systems around human-centered goals such as &lt;i&gt;searching&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inspiration. &lt;/i&gt;It asks designers to consider: What if, instead of automating away decisions from ourselves, we focused on augmenting and extending decision making by allowing AI systems to become collaborators in our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke about this idea with Associate Professor Oliver Brown. He is both &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/76rNPeXwFcvii9vnKMDnn0?si=6Skua1pmScGNZaHPKOxRjw&quot;&gt;an electronic musician&lt;/a&gt; and founder of the Interactive Media Lab at the University of New South Wales. In his recent book &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/beyond-creative-species&quot;&gt;Beyond the Creative Species&lt;/a&gt;, Prof. Brown explores the role computers play in creating music, art, and other cultural artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the machine can simulate neural processes, it can perform creative search and discover new and valuable things, and therefore, it can entirely be creative. There’s no mystery about that at all,” said Brown on the subject of whether AI systems can be creative. But he sees a limitation. “We’ve yet to build machines that are very successfully culturally embedded, and one of the most important things is that artistic practices, right down to their motivations, are culturally grounded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key distinction is made here; systems like Google’s Magenta can generate musical rhythm and melody endlessly. But the system itself has no understanding of motivation or cultural context—it has no idea if the beat it’s made is, in fact, sick. “If you just program a machine to generate patterns, it doesn’t have any strategies and goals and objectives. It’s therefore lacking in a really obvious way,” said Brown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culturally grounding AI systems means working out how to embed human-centered goals and objectives in AI-driven decision-making. For example, Magenta cannot evaluate how &lt;i&gt;valuable&lt;/i&gt; its output is. To do that, we need to build machines that understand cultural value as we do. Without this, AI systems will remain isolated probabilistic number generators, prone to bias and misunderstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study conducted at DWAIL, we looked closely at music producers working with Magenta. The study’s goal was to understand how Magenta contributes to creative decision-making. Participants were asked to compose music with Magenta and estimate how close they were to completing their creative task. While doing this, we monitored their interactions with the system, focusing on when they used the system to generate new musical output. We found that Magenta can dramatically change the course of a creative task, provoking a composer to change their approach and explore new ideas. Still, it wasn’t always a positive experience for users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed that users can be easily discouraged if Magenta can’t reproduce valuable musical output. For example, the user inputs a musical sequence, and Magenta generates musical output. But when the user listens to this output, they estimate that they’re actually further from their goal than before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In follow-up interviews, users were asked to review footage of themselves composing with Magenta. When asked about moments when they estimated they were further from their goal after listening to Magenta’s output, it became clear that not all generated material was of equal value. Magenta could not understand their creative goals and could not communicate effectively with the user about the desirable qualities of generated musical sequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication of human-centered goals with AI-driven tools is the new frontier for designers and developers alike. Engaging our intelligent tools as collaborators by embedding cultural awareness is the first step in building more accountability, trustworthiness, and transparency into our everyday experiences with AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boring dystopia is one in which we fail to pursue an alternative vision of AI-driven decision making, one where unaccountable, black-boxed algorithms make decisions about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22455140/lemonade-insurance-ai-twitter&quot;&gt;insurance claims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/amazons-sexist-hiring-algorithm-could-still-be-better-than-a-human-105270&quot;&gt;who gets hired&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/08/women-less-likely-ads-high-paid-jobs-google-study&quot;&gt;reinforce gender inequality&lt;/a&gt;. If we continue to allow the proliferation of AI-driven automated decision-making uncritically, we will continue to see instances of AI gone wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope we choose the alternative. Let’s reframe our relationship with AI-driven tools and focus on how they can extend, enhance, and augment decision-making processes. Let’s design new tools that support human-led, collaborative, and culturally grounded partnerships with our intelligent tools, drawing on the principles of accountability, trustworthiness, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two design resources for thinking through this problem are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pair.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Google’s People + AI Research (PAIR) group guidebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.ibm.com/teams/trusted-ai#:~:text=Biases%20find%20their%20way%20into,humans%20and%20machines%20that%20learn.&quot;&gt;IBM Research’s Trusted AI tools&lt;/a&gt;. Both are practical starting places for designers and developers to get started on this critical shift in thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Genevieve Bell on advancing user research]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/genevieve-bell-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/genevieve-bell-research</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Professor Genevieve Bell is a fantastic conversational partner. Like all good professional academics, she has an incredible grasp of a range of topics, including (but not limited to) history, technology, government, sociology, and obviously, anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/genevieve-bell-technology-research/&quot;&gt;In a recent article&lt;/a&gt;, we spoke to Bell about the future of technology. Given her leading role in building Intel’s social science’s competency and current mission to invent an entirely new branch of engineering, it’s a subject that Bell is more than well-versed in. (Take that as a nudge to give the article a read, if you haven’t already!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Bell is a fount of knowledge on any given number of topics, but in matters of research—she’s one of the best minds in the biz. Naturally, we jumped at the opportunity to hear her thoughts on the future of the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our conversation, we talked about diversity, “productive discomfort,” and what cybernetics—a decades-old transdisciplinary study of systems—can teach us about research. While we couldn’t cover everything, what follows is a few high-level thoughts designed to inspire creativity and trigger the imagination to rethink our approach to product research and design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Embrace “productive discomfort”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell and I begin by discussing the merits of diversity in research. It’s a common theme in the research community as more people become aware of the startling impact a lack of diverse voices has on product development and society as a whole. We even wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/how-to-embrace-inclusivity-in-ux-research/&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; recently that provided a few tips for anyone looking to make their practice more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, beyond including diverse perspectives in research—which can often be a box-ticking exercise lacking in substance, Bell pushes the concept. She suggests that more voices should lead to situations of “productive discomfort,” which she believes produces better outcomes that authentically embrace the idea of diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more voices in the room and the more diversity of perspectives, the better,” Bell states matter of factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bearing in mind that once you do that, you have to be willing to create a space for productive discomfort.”     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Down with post-its (kind of)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Productive discomfort” is a way of approaching research in a way that doesn’t seek harmony, agreement, or even solutions necessarily. It’s a key concept for Bell, who tells me our contemporary practices (think: post-its and sticky dots) are designed to consolidate thinking around a single idea. Usually, one that resonates with everyone in the room. “I love post-its, don’t get me wrong,” Bell laughs. “I have a problem with the way we sometimes use them to get to a shared point of view. Frequently, that’s just a way of externalizing the things we want for ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, there’s a something in asking how we would do a post-it notes or brainstorming session where the outcomes were discomforting rather than comforting. Hence that space of productive discomfort. A moment where you encounter a pause, and you think, ‘This just wasn’t built for me.’ What does that feel like? And how do we use that as a generative exercise rather than something to resolve?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving versus resolving problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell recites a line she recently heard from the Dean of Architectural Design at MIT about engineers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said to me, the thing about engineers is that they want to solve problems. And the thing about designers is they want to &lt;i&gt;resolve&lt;/i&gt; problems. I think there’s something beautiful in the notion that maybe good products don’t tidy everything up. They actually work with the things that are around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a matter of erasing the past. It’s a matter of building into it, around it, and with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What cybernetics can teach us about research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell’s inclination for the eclectic and fascination with systems comes into play as she describes how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics&quot;&gt;cybernetics&lt;/a&gt; (the transdisciplinary study of self-regulating systems) can teach us something about product research and design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you imagine a system that always has to have people, some sort of technology, and some kind of environment and ecology?” Bell ponders. She’s referencing one of the mainstays of cybernetic thought—that interrelated systems can exist in a “dialogue” with each other. That technology doesn’t need to “solve” the environment or people but exist in a space of “productive discomfort” that never truly gets resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next insight Bell provides comes from her thinking about cybernetics. She tells me how struck she is that the ideas have endured so well and that those same ideas had room for reinvention and reinterpretation. She describes this as “grace.” Perhaps it is also a head nod to &lt;a href=&quot;https://allpoetry.com/All-Watched-Over-By-Machines-Of-Loving-Grace&quot;&gt;Richard Brautigan’s poem&lt;/a&gt;, which she frequently cites and has a place on her bookshelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t mean graceful or elegant. I mean grace in that it has enough of a core to it that it will hold its form, but enough flexibility that other people can reinterpret it to be something else,” muses Bell. “I think for me, that manifests itself in a couple of ways.” She then goes on to say how Agile and Six Sigma and other modern ways of working efficiently have a place but, because of their success, have become an orthodoxy that sometimes stifles different viewpoints. “Some of the most interesting products of the past one hundred years were ones that people could re-imagine in different ways,” Bell points out. “They could imprint their own meaning on them. They could extend them, and they could remake them in some other way. They could localize them. And there’s something about making something with enough &lt;i&gt;grace&lt;/i&gt; that the edges can blur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you folks think about the concepts of “Grace” and “productive discomfort”? Should disagreement and discomfort be more readily embraced by researchers?

And with the resumption of international travel and the promise of a new year, we all have a lot to look forward to—including, it seems, major career pivots. Over the past year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/australia-s-version-of-the-great-resignation-revealed-as-staff-swap-jobs-20211111-p5984f.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;35 million American workers have left their jobs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In September, an additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;4.4 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; left. It’s not just an American phenomenon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/the-great-resignation-a-sense-of-possibility-allows-workers-to-quit-their-jobs-20211029-p594cw.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aussies are feeling it as well&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of workers Down Under who changed jobs in October was 26 percent higher than it was pre-pandemic in 2019 according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartcompany.com.au/people-human-resources/great-resignation-aussies-changing-jobs/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;LinkedIn data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

He’s founded multiple companies—including one that was acquired by Twitter in 2012. He has also worked at Under Armour and Boxee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/phoebe-gardner/?originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Phoebe Gardner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bardee.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bardee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a startup dedicated to reshaping the global food system by transforming food waste into protein and fertilizer. She’s at the helm of what just may be a revolutionary Australian unicorn, and we’re lucky to benefit from her insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-cowan-46805182/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simon Cowan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the Research Director at Sydney’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cis.org.au/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Center for Independent Studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He is an economist and policy expert and has previously discussed budgetary issues and health policy in front of the Australian Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked, in his opinion, why people are leaving their jobs in droves, Drew noted that the pandemic caused a lot of people to look inwards and reflect about whether they found their jobs fulfilling and meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ones who didn’t answer in the affirmative were incentivized to quit, perhaps driven by a life-is-too-short mentality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick echoed similar sentiments, explaining that “COVID taught us all that we can work from home...which in some ways is the same as working from anywhere. COVID also forced us to reflect on what we value. As many of our freedoms were restricted, whether it was family, or friends, or nature...we suddenly saw what mattered to us much more clearly. And working from home spiked people&amp;#39;s burnout...so you have people needing a change, wanting a change, and having the freedom to make one. That&amp;#39;s where the shift has come from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon was less eager to conflate correlation with causation, expressing a reticence to blame the so-called “Great Resignation” on any one cause or set of causes. “Significant caution should be exercised from trying to interpret labour market changes stemming from a 1 in a 100 year global pandemic,” he noted. “Workers, particularly in Australia’s most populous cities of Sydney and Melbourne, have been locked down for months at a time, forced to work from home or furloughed. Welfare has been boosted by unprecedented amounts. All of these things have had unpredictable and unanticipated impacts on workforce trends and participation. Let’s see what the data says in three years’ time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Incentives, incentives &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is all somewhat speculative, as neither Drew nor Nick has personally dealt with large degrees of turnover. Strong incentives, they believe, improve retention rates and have protected them as employers from the rising tide of leaving employees. According to Drew, “Working from anywhere, competitive salaries, flexible vacation policy, [and] in-person events and get together[s] to still foster a strong sense of unity with the team” have all worked well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick elaborated on this further and spoke to what has worked for him and his team at Blackbird. “What people need changes as you grow,” he explained. “At Blackbird, as we&amp;#39;ve grown, we&amp;#39;ve had to invest in making sure each team knows what other teams are working on. We&amp;#39;ve moved to a RACI structure (Responsible, Accountable, Contributing, and Informed) to make it clearer who owns what. We&amp;#39;ve seen people struggle to take time off so we&amp;#39;ve implemented company-wide Kit-Kat days [of the same kind that Dovetail uses] where we all switch off for the day. We&amp;#39;ve bolstered the mental health support we provide our team. We&amp;#39;ve invested in training our managers to be better at what they do. And we&amp;#39;ve been really disciplined about making the first week of every month Zoom-free, and not having any Slack activity outside of business hours. There&amp;#39;s some quiet on nights and weekends that is pressure relieving. There&amp;#39;s a lot more than that but those are some good examples.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Drew and Nick seem to have adopted these policies voluntarily, Simon noted starkly that soon, employers won’t have much of a choice. If they want to retain their employees, they’re going to need to pile on the incentives. “Companies will need to be aggressive about providing both generous remuneration and rapid advancement opportunities for high performing workers,” he argued. “The idea of ‘doing your time’ was already becoming old-fashioned and inefficient but that’s been accelerated now. Ordinary workers are likely to expect and demand greater workplace flexibility, perhaps even more so than higher wages. Having worked from home for two years, even moderately competent workers will be increasingly less likely to tolerate a culture of ‘presenteeism’ in the workforce.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of where we go from here, it seems that the burden rests mainly on the shoulders of founders and employers. As the labor market reacts to the precipitous changes of the unprecedented events that have marched their way wantonly through the past two years, employees will have their pick of who they work for, how they spend their time, and under what conditions they do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, founders and employers would do well to think outside the box about how best to move forward. There are few people that have done this better than Bardee’s CEO and co-founder, Phoebe Gardner. While she’s pursuing a hybrid work model, she has found that given the choice, her remote and in-office teams generally tend to stick to their ground. That is, at Bardee, most people are either fully remote or fully in-office. There’s little in between. To keep everybody in the loop, all communications and decisions are run through shared slack channels of which all employees are a part. For her and her team, this has worked well, and she’s had very little turnover in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While COVID has undoubtedly given us all a massive headache, it’s also forced us to rethink how we do business. And for some, like Phoebe, it’s been a blessing in disguise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bardee’s business is “quite multidisciplinary,” she told me, “and we’ve drawn from a lot of different pools of talent. We’ve ended up with 20 people and eight different first languages. There’s no way we would have hired like that without COVID…it means that the whole world is your talent pool and you can seek the best whereas without COVID we would have been very likely to look locally.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catastrophe, tragedy, and upheaval necessitate change, which creates new possibilities and opportunities and worlds for all of us. What the future of work means for founders remains uncertain. As Motley Crue’s frontman Vince Neil once put it back in ‘89: “Now it’s time for change. Nothing stays the same. Now it’s time for change.” The silver lining to an atrocious pandemic is that it will propel us into the future. It’s time for change, indeed. And employers probably need to wake up to this if they’re to retain their employees. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Embrace failure]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/embrace-failure</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/embrace-failure</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is very important to embrace failure and to do a lot of stuff—as much stuff as possible—with as little fear as possible.

Spool is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people cook for themselves, is that democratizing restaurants?” asks Spool, a wry grin spreading across his cheeks. In the research community and beyond, Spool’s ideas are well known. Perhaps less well-known is his penchant for witty analogies. Before the end of our conversation, he’ll pepper me with some more. But not before he takes his shot at a few sacred cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To me, this democratizing trend is a statement of arrogance,” says Spool. “It has the air of ‘letting the peons do the work that I do.’” As he says this, Spool does what appears to be an impersonation of a feudal lord. He apologizes for the poor impersonation before launching back into his point. “It’s the phrase researchers use to give permission to people who they otherwise didn’t want to give permission to. ‘Yes, yes. We will democratize this. We will carve out small pieces and let you do your thing.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m taken slightly aback by Spool’s take on democratization. Not in a bad way. It’s refreshing. But the perspectives on democratization usually fall into two camps. Camp one believes democratization dilutes the craft and unfairly treats research as a set of activities rather than a profession. This group is decidedly anti-democratization of research. Camp two believes democratization is the way forward for research. By offloading more routine research activities like evaluative testing to stakeholders, camp two argues researchers can focus on more strategic, high-impact activities. This group is pro-democratization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spool is in his own camp—he believes &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; sides are wrong, and he tells me exactly why. “When we talk about democratizing research, we treat the research as the end goal. It’s not the end goal,” he states bluntly. “Research is a practice we use to get a shared understanding of what the problem is. The democratization movement rarely talks about that. It talks about giving people access to tools that allow them to conduct certain kinds of research,” says Spool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with camp two&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spool’s referring to the argument proposed by “camp two.” Their idea is that professional researchers should focus on high-impact research projects while a well-trained apprentice can conduct usability testing activities. Eduardo Gomez Ruiz, Design Lead at Miro, promotes this angle in his &lt;i&gt;UXPlanet&lt;/i&gt; article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/training-an-army-of-non-researchers-7a1853553b5&quot;&gt;Scaling UX Research: how to train an army of (non)researchers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruiz’s article provides practical and grounded advice for teams looking to expand their research capacity through democratization. But as Spool suggested, the stated end goal is to have non-researchers pick up a range of skills and conduct research activities—i.e., the research is treated as an end in itself. Carrying out usability testing or crafting simple surveys for feedback would almost certainly bring the team closer to the customer to some extent. But still, Spool argues it isn’t a good use of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not effective to relegate research to what essentially amounts to QA work—which is important—but should be a small percentage of what’s happening,” says Spool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thing that bothers me about the democratization movement is it’s very much about being a gatekeeper—which is ironic,” says Spool. “Whenever I hear people talk about democratizing research, what they’re really saying is they want people to do the parts of research they don’t like to do and keep the rest of it for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spool then hits me with another analogy. “It’s like having this lovely cow that we’ve butchered, that we’ll share with you, but we’re going to keep the prime cuts of meat. We’re going to give you the chewy bits. To some extent, that’s what people talk about when they talk about democratization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Spool isn’t opposed to providing non-researchers with training or that research shouldn’t be everywhere in an organization—he simply doesn’t think the democratization movement advocates for the right things. It puts the research cart before the insights horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spool’s thoughts are mirrored in another &lt;i&gt;UXPlanet&lt;/i&gt; article on democratization by Saswati Saha Mitra, a former colleague of Ruiz and current Group Research Leader at WhatsApp. In the piece titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/undemocratising-user-research-6897e6f4cf72&quot;&gt;Undemocratising User Research&lt;/a&gt;, Saha Mitra provides a sobering case study of the failings of democratization efforts from her time at Uber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Democratization] failed because no matter how much you plan and organize, high-quality insights require much more than a faster insights gathering process,” writes Saha Mitra. “It took more time and effort to deliver than the value it delivered to the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herein lies the problem. The effort and resources expended on democratization don’t yield real insight into customer problems. By focusing on the training, frameworks, methodologies, and research outputs, something bigger is missed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with camp one&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for “camp one,” Spool also dismisses the argument that democratization threatens to dilute the research craft. It’s a common theme that comes up in discussion about democratization and one that’s hinted at in Carol Barnum’s seminal essay on the topic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxpajournal.org/state-ux-research/&quot;&gt;The State of User Research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Journal of Usability Studies&lt;/i&gt; (2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spool points out that doctors don’t mind people putting bandaids on themselves, nor do dentists hate it when you brush your teeth. He hits me with one more analogy. “People don’t stop going to restaurants when they learn how to cook. They appreciate fine cooking even more,” he aptly points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just insecurity speaking. If they were truly good at their craft, they’d be hopelessly transparent about it,” Spool adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is there more to democratization?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair to the democratization concept, it’s often discussed as much more than simply “training an army of non-researchers.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetail.com/blog/what-is-the-democratization-of-user-research/&quot;&gt;In a previous article&lt;/a&gt;, Dovetail’s Product Design Lead Lucy Denton talks about democratization as a cultural shift in an organization led by researchers who educate, inform, and open up the research craft. The goal isn’t to transform stakeholders into apprentice researchers but to guide the entire organization to better customer understanding. The real challenge that democratization seeks to tackle is how you “engage” non-researchers in the research process, and ultimately how you facilitate deeper customer understanding across an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spool more or less agrees with this perspective but still believes democratization is the “wrong verb.” It focuses on the output—the research—rather than the outcome—deeper customer understanding, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ideal &lt;i&gt;outcome&lt;/i&gt; would be: I can talk to anybody on the team about some aspect of the user’s experience—frustrating, complicated, convoluted things that are really hard for users to deal with, and everybody has the same understanding of what that is,” says Spool. “Also, hopefully, they have the same vision as to how we’re going to solve that thing and know the baby steps to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exposure is everything&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What advice does Spool have for researchers looking to guide their organization toward a closer understanding of the customer? It will come as no surprise to anyone who follows Spool, he suggests a concept called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.uie.com/user_exposure_hours/&quot;&gt;exposure hours&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exposure, in its simplest form, is the amount of time that someone who makes a decision that affects the user’s experience spends with the people who have that experience,” explains Spool. “When companies are really small—like two or three people—they have incredible contact with their customers. But as companies grow, insulation forms between the people who make the most significant decisions and those affected by the decisions—the users and the customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, that insulation prevents decision-makers from understanding that the decision they made in the meeting room the other day has this incredible effect on the people who they’re trying to serve,” Spool elaborates. “The more we punch holes in that insulation and get direct exposure between the decision-makers and the folks who are feeling the effects of those decisions, the more we can create a feedback loop that drives better decision-making. And that’s really what we’re talking about: creating that environment where a feedback loop can happen and doing that at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a familiar point of view at Dovetail—our CEO and Co-founder Benjamin Humphrey talks about the growing insulation between decision-makers and users as a “customer understanding gap.” By making research and insights more accessible to stakeholders, he believes organizations can “punch holes” in the insulation around decision-makers, helping them make better customer-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a (rather extended) nutshell—that’s Jared Spool’s view on the democratization of research. It’s clear by the end, his aversion to the idea comes down to a framing of the problem, where he believes democratization emphasizes the wrong thing. To conclude, I’ll leave you with one last analogy, courtesy of Spool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Democratizing research is] like saying, we’re not trying to get our errands done, we’re trying to drive today. It’s nice to go for a drive. But what about when you want to go somewhere? It would be nice to know where that place was and how we could get there before we get in the car.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I told you he liked analogies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Human-centered design with Canva’s Nadia Surtees]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/human-centered-design-canvas-nadia-surtees</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/human-centered-design-canvas-nadia-surtees</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human-centered design is a popular design approach these days. Rather than designing from a singular perspective, human-centered design invites users to participate in the design process from the ground up. By placing the customer—the human—in the center and facilitating their participation throughout, designers can come up with a range of innovative solutions to customer problems resulting in products that magically improve people’s lives in ways they would never have foreseen. Such is the power of human-centered design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean to be human-centered? Beyond the high-level stuff, what tactical steps can we take to implement these processes in our work? To help us navigate these waters, we’ve employed the help of Nadia Surtees, a former IDEO designer and a current Product Design Lead at Canva, to steer the ship while we look to get her perspective of this customer-centric philosophy to product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why human-centered design?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Surtees’s words, human-centered design is the intentional focus of “cultivating empathy for the people and communities you’re designing for.” Further, one needs to look at the effects your design might have on that community in the near term and look ahead at the secondary consequences of what that design might entail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re designing with the needs of people you’re creating for at the center of your design process. And they’re part of it from day one. It leads to a product or service that people will be excited about and they’re going to use because you haven’t designed in a vacuum. You’ve involved them in the process,” says Surtees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HCD isn’t only for customers, however. It’s great for designers themselves. Nadia explains how her own motivations as a designer naturally lend themselves to a human-centered approach. She tells me how she wants to make things that improve society and the quality of life of the people who interact with her creations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to create things that satisfy the ego,” she says. “That’s such a small way of thinking, rather than the expansive sensibility of making other people’s lives better and acting as a channel for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But what can I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to unpack human-centered design, but the approach involves three phases at its essence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In phase one—&lt;b&gt;inspiration&lt;/b&gt;—you “learn directly from the people you’re designing for as you immerse yourself in their lives and come to deeply understand their needs,” according to IDEO’s human-centered design kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase two is &lt;b&gt;ideation&lt;/b&gt;, where “you make sense of what you learned, identify opportunities for design, and prototype possible solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final &lt;b&gt;implementation&lt;/b&gt; phase, you bring the solution to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this general overview is a good launch point, Surtees tells me that human-centered design practices are much less about specific methods and more about a mindset in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former IDEO designer emphasizes the importance of coming to a design challenge confident in your ability to sit with whatever comes up without having to be right or have the correct answers at hand. To be able to hold ambiguity. It reminds me of a similar idea Professor Genevieve Bell brought up &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/genevieve-bell-research/&quot;&gt;during our conversation a few months prior&lt;/a&gt;. She told me that researchers and designers have to get accustomed to “productive discomfort”—holding the space of unknowing and not necessarily seeking solutions. It should come as no surprise that Bell also is a massive advocate for human-centered design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ask the right questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re designing something, always begin with a really clear design question. One that’s not outcome-driven,” says Surtees. “We want to hit 20,000 monthly active users. That&amp;#39;s a great product metric, but it’s not a generative design question. A great design question is ‘how might we empower families to feel more confident in the kitchen, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on hypothetical, Surtees describes how to start thinking about the people you are designing for. “Stretch the boundaries of what you define to be families. Are they families of five, of mixed backgrounds, living in rural environments, are the families living in really compact, urban dwellings?” she explains. “And then when you’re beginning to recruit and have conversations, get to know them, hold that space, ask them questions about their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The sacrificial concept&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surtees recommends bringing a prototype to your early conversations with users. These prototypes are known as “sacrificial concepts,” as the designer has no real attachment to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re concepts you intentionally decide you’re not getting emotionally invested in because you don’t know what’s going to work,” says Surtees. “How could you possibly know what’s going to work for a family of five that lives in rural Byron bay when you are a single person who’s living in Melbourne. It’s so important to come to those conversations with an open mindset to understand the critique of the design.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By placing distance between yourself and the design, Surtees says you can begin to understand how to improve the product if you remain open to hearing negative feedback. She says it’s these moments that help shape her thinking as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Human-centered analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re big fans of tagging at Dovetail, in case you hadn’t noticed. And so is Surtees. She offers some fascinating insight into what to look for while analyzing customer interviews during the design process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look for the nuances of what’s happening. Sometimes we’re looking for consistencies, like quantifying how many times a person of a certain user group says something. But often, it’s those nuggets that feel different that are most interesting,” says Surtees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surtees believes that the fringe cases, the insights that don’t sit right, the exceptions to the rule, are often best for pushing a design forward. “It’s about holding both. It’s about holding that sense of patterning and repetitive nature of your findings, but also looking for the difference—the things that feel a little bit out of the ordinary—that can lead to some inspiring new design paths,” says Surtees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recruit the right participants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends at User Interviews agree—the right participants can make or break your research. And just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/participant-recruitment-101-with-user-interviews-vp-of-product-john-henry/&quot;&gt;User Inteview’s Head of Product explained in a previous interview&lt;/a&gt;, Surtees says that finding participants who are generative, opinionated, and who build on your ideas lead to richer design opportunities than people who give only one-word answers. That means screening your participants so that you’re not just looking for people who meet the profile but will show up to the conversation in a rich and insightful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to engage your stakeholders with HCD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, we’re sure you’re sold on human-centered design approaches—if you weren’t already. But what good is being mindful, empathetic, and genuinely connecting with your users on problems if nobody else in your organization cares?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing stakeholders along for the ride is an important part of any research and design process—that is, if you care about seeing your ideas brought to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Surtees has some expert advice on this as well. She points to strong storytelling techniques as pivotal in gaining the attention of her stakeholders. “I’m a big fan of creating podcasts out of my interview audio and making it fun by putting it in our pre-read, and maybe having one of our team members do a voiceover to introduce the ‘three hero users’ of the research,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surtees says to make the pods short and snackable—keeping them to about 5 minutes in length. “We need to design our research sharing to be pithy, memorable, and entertaining. Especially as everyone is time-poor. Choosing an engaging format is better than having a lengthy research report that’s difficult to digest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with HCD in your org&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start small and scale. Be realistic about the appetite the organization has for human-centered design. If you’re in a high-growth company that has big goals, and everything’s on a tight timeline, don’t start by suggesting a three-month ethnographic, multi-country schedule of research. Start with two or three interviews, or try one new method for a design project. In short: don’t overwhelm your team!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a tactical learning perspective, I’ll do a little plug for IDEO because they have so many courses out there with the right teachers, methods, and mindsets. That would be my strong recommendation,” says Surtees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, in everything you do, bring a lens of curiosity, bring a prototype early, start conversations with people, and even bring that level of human-centered design to your internal stakeholders. Think about how you can talk to them and get curious about what their needs are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s keeping them up at night? What’s frustrating them? What do they wish was working better? Design thinking doesn’t just need to be like an external-facing way of looking at users. It can also be a way to look internally to think about what isn’t working in the way we’re approaching challenges and figuring out what can we do about that.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design can play, and is already playing, a critical role in rethinking food of the future]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/design-can-play-and-is-already-playing-a-critical-role-in-rethinking-food-of</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/design-can-play-and-is-already-playing-a-critical-role-in-rethinking-food-of</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[“Where are all the women?” Genevieve Bell on women in tech]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/genevieve-bell-women-in-tech</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/genevieve-bell-women-in-tech</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The tech industry is famous for a lot of reasons. The personalities, platforms, gadgets, innovation, and higher than average pay all contribute to its reputation as an appealing industry for fresh-faced graduates looking to cut their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, tech also has another reputation: its golden doors and lucrative opportunities are not always open to women. How an industry that prides itself on forward-thinking has ended up run almost exclusively by men has been the topic of hot debate, fraught with the usual vitriol that accompanies gender discourse in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we jump in and consider this issue like adults—with the help of real-life adult Professor Genevieve Bell—here’s a quick summary of some of the &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt; reasons put forward for why, despite making up almost half of the modern workforce, women still only comprise a quarter of the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women aren’t tech-savvy. They consume tech but don’t really understand it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women aren’t interested in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and maths) subjects required for entry into the tech industry. They’re much more at home in the humanities and soft sciences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women prefer a healthier work-life balance. The demands of the tech industry are too high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To any reasonable person, the above list would seem outdated, to say the least. But even if most recognize the problem runs deeper than bad stereotypes, these opinions are not as uncommon as you would think (just spend some time on Twitter, you’ll see plenty of it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the topic has seen a lot of attention in recent years as individual women and adjacent activist groups push to reform our archaic cultural norms. There is no shortage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2020/jan/02/ten-years-on-why-are-there-still-so-few-women-in-tech&quot;&gt;great articles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/&quot;&gt;think pieces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/3516012/women-in-tech-statistics-the-hard-truths-of-an-uphill-battle.html&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenintech.co.uk/women-technology-survey-2019&quot;&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt;, and more covering the subject in great depth from a series of diverse and nuanced perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We won’t pretend to be experts in this domain—the writer of this article is a white male and works for a tech company still trying to reach gender parity (check out our work on Project 50/50 for more details). However, we do want to shed light on the topic through the lens of one of tech’s most well-known women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Bell has been the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/blog/search/?q=Genevieve%20Bell&quot;&gt;two previous &lt;/a&gt;articles in Outlier, where we’ve covered everything from the history and future of technological development to what cybernetics can teach us about user research. In this final installment in the series, we’re going to talk about Bell’s personal experiences as a woman in the tech industry, her work pushing women’s issues to the foreground at Intel, and her advice for the next generation of young women coming up through the ranks today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where are all the women?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Bell is no stranger to the struggle for women’s rights. Her mother, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Bell&quot;&gt;Diane Bell&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the world’s most notable feminist anthropologists. One can only imagine the kinds of dinner table conversations taking place in that house, not to mention growing up around university campuses in the 80s meant regularly interfacing with radical politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say, the seeds for activism were planted early on in Bell’s life. And throughout her time as one of Intel’s rising stars, those seeds blossomed, with Bell becoming a key figure in the charge for diversity and inclusion at the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a thoughtful and darkly hilarious fashion, Bell describes what it was like transitioning from academic anthropology at Stanford University, where 70 percent of her cohort were women, to the male-dominated tech industry in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spent a good year thinking that women were just in a different building,” she says, laughing. “There’re 15,000 people on site, right across all of Oregon, which is where I was supported. I just kept assuming there were multiple cafeterias, and all the women were somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it hit Bell that her phantom colleagues weren’t in a different building but rather didn’t exist at all, she enlisted the help of her male peers to rectify the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found a couple of senior men, and I basically just started saying to them, where are the women?” Bell tells me. “We cannot be building the future if the future just looks like all of you—so what are you going to do about that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell describes the hard work of shifting Intel’s ossified cultural norms. New systems and ways of hiring, mentoring, retaining, and promoting women were advocated for and implemented. She tells me she and a diverse group of women “agitated a great deal” for diversity and inclusion. She gave a regular presentation called “Where are all the women,” pinpointing on the company’s org chart where she saw hiring opportunities. Change did not happen overnight, and it was only through the persistence and effort on behalf of Bell and her counterparts that progress was slowly made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diversity isn’t enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have long borne out the positive impacts of diversity on decision-making and investment, but as Bell points out, simply hiring people from different backgrounds isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that doesn’t get discussed so much are the consequences of pursuing diversity initiatives. It’s fine to bring more diverse people into an organization, but then you need to start investing in a whole series of other processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses need to invest in creating a place where women and minority groups are not only safe but where their voices can be heard. “Where you don’t end up saying, tell us what you think as the woman,” says Bell. “Making someone speak for an entire group creates more work for that person and imposes the assumption that they’re the only person who has that responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bell, businesses have to pay attention to the outreach and marketing materials they use, checking that they don’t present an unintentionally sexist portrayal of women in the workplace. “It would be really good in your marketing material if, in every photo of your employee base, you don’t have a man performing a power pose and women staring at him adoringly. Or a man writing on a whiteboard and all the women on their laptops,” laughs Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There will be conflict—and that’s a good thing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an organization invites more diverse perspectives, it should be prepared for the resulting conflict that comes with it, says Bell. “It turns out once you have people who come from different places in their worlds and have different viewpoints and different skills, they argue a lot. Not because they necessarily think any less of each other, but because they have different vocabularies, different theoretical paradigms, different approaches, and you have to find a way to make that productive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The history of women in technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of women in technology today is underscored by a darker reality— women have been at the forefront of technological innovation since its early days and have since been sidelined by male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, more women were graduating in computer science in the 1980s than today, making it the only STEM discipline to see women’s participation rates drop in modern times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell references women’s employment as “human computers” in the 1940s when programming was thought of as a lowly clerical function. Women were also widely employed to perform advanced ballistics calculations as part of the war effort. Part of this work was the development of the world’s first electronic computer—the ENIAC— which was worked on primarily by women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After men returned from the war in the US, many of them took advantage of the GI Bill’s offer of a free education to pursue a career in technology, working side-by-side with their female counterparts. It probably comes as no surprise, but these men, armed with the privileges of their gender, went on to dominate the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an entire system that structurally reinforces itself,” says Bell. “So it’s not that men are better at those things or that men want to do them more. It’s that every sign and signal through that system means you have more men running things, looking for people that they feel comfortable with, who coincidentally happened to look more and more like them. And so the system reproduces itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’ve been women there the whole time, though. We just write them out of the story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bell’s legacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Bell is no stranger to inaugurals. She is the first person to hold the inaugural Florence Violet McKenzie Chair at the Australian National University, named after Australia’s first female electrical engineer. Bell is also the first SRI International Engelbart Distinguished Fellow, the first female Senior Fellow at Intel (Intel’s highest technical rank), and the first woman we know of to head up a school of cybernetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubting Bell’s contributions to the field. Her recognition is well deserved. Though, she tells me it’s unfortunate she was the first woman to receive so many of these awards and titles, considering how many deserving women had come before her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Usually, what that feeling does is energize me to make sure that while I might be the first, I will never be the last or the only,” Bell tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think you have an interesting obligation as a senior person, and I suspect particularly as a senior woman, to both be visible but also clear about the work it takes to get there. You don’t want it to be as if by magic; it takes hard work. And then you also want to make sure you are creating as many opportunities and possibilities for the people that follow you,” says Bell. “And then I think it’s got to be about how you ensure—not that the women that follow you are exceptional, because they are exceptional—but that the system sees and recognizes them. So for me, it’s as much about how you change the men in the system than it is to make the women any better than they already are because most of them are already amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in Bell’s work at the 3A Institute in the School of Cybernetics at the Australian National University, you should know they’re currently recruiting students from a broad range of backgrounds and disciplines for the 2022 Master of Applied Cybernetics.

This marks a significant milestone for the organization that can now unleash its fleet of driverless Chevy Bolts onto the road to test their tech out in complex urban environments with real passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the proper fun will start when their flagship vehicle—the aptly named Origin—hits the production line sometime in 2023. The Origin is the company’s first vehicle specifically designed to operate without a driver on board. Unlike the Chevy Bolts, it does not have manual controls such as pedals or a steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an ambitious vision of a driverless future and radical plans to reimagine what personal transportation looks like, it’s clear that Cruise, with its $10 billion war chest, is doing more than just spinning wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we decided to &lt;i&gt;cruise&lt;/i&gt; on over for a video call to speak with the company’s Director of Research and Insights, Arianna McClain, to get a better look under the hood of the research process at one of the most exciting autonomous vehicle organizations in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tell us a little bit about your role at Cruise&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was initially hired as the Director of User Experience Research. But over the course of the past nine months, I’ve started overseeing research across all users as the Director of Research and Insights. We’re in charge of research for engineers and engineering products. We have a hardware team, and a traditional ride-hail and delivery experience team, which is probably what most people think of when they think of User Experience Research at Cruise. We also have a new Autonomous Vehicle Behavior team working on understanding what riders want from autonomous vehicle behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Can you tell us more about the research you conduct for creating engineering tools?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to realize self-driving cars have never existed before. And this is what you’re going to hear me say a lot, and this is what I say when I interview candidates—how do you do something that’s never existed before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means all the tools engineers use to develop self-driving cars have never existed before. Imagine having dozens of engineers working on one autonomous vehicle behavior, such as an unprotected left turn. These teams that make the brain of the car smarter need to collaborate and understand if their models are improving autonomous vehicle behavior over time. So our research team spends a lot of time with these engineers to understand if their tools are easy to onboard and use to speed up the development workflows and increase collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What are some of the primary considerations when designing autonomous vehicle behavior?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can give you a very specific example of how we need to think about autonomous vehicle behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our autonomous vehicle behavior team is going to start thinking about certain things like pick-ups and drop-offs to try and understand where the safe spots to pick people up are. To do this, we will have a user researcher talk to riders and understand what a safe spot looks like. And then, they will work with our legal or policy team and our engineering team and tell them what riders want. We will also work with the city to pass on the information around the areas that are okay to drop off in that are also consistent with people’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to think of unique autonomous behaviors and what those autonomous behaviors might be. For example, how do riders expect our vehicles to react to an emergency vehicle? How should they respond regarding pick-up and drop-off? Should they go the speed of traffic if it’s over the speed limit? These are all the things we need to think about to create a human driving experience that doesn’t feel robotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s it like to work at one of the best capitalized autonomous vehicle companies in the world?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is amazing to partner with General Motors and Honda as both an investor and partner because it gives us the flexibility to operate as an independent startup but with big company benefits. I’m going to give you a few examples from a research perspective. When I first got to Cruise two and a half years ago, we weren’t ready to have passengers ride in our vehicles. The technology wasn’t developed. From a User Experience research perspective, we needed to understand (and we’re still trying to understand better) what information we need to provide in the UI or onboarding, for example, to make riders feel safe and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, we partnered with the super-talented and experienced R&amp;amp;D researchers at General Motors. One of my favorite stories to tell is about how GM loaned us a right-side driving vehicle, which sounds super basic, but it really helped. This meant we could hide real drivers and tell people there was technology hidden on the right side of the vehicle. We drove around the GM campus and had a trained driver act like a self-driving vehicle. Six out of the seven riders thought they were in a self-driving car. We had things like a fake app that would allow voice input from the passenger to control the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM also has a cutting-edge lab facility that enables us to conduct research. So we were able to run a few studies in their simulator. We also have the GM’s Milford Proving Ground to drive around the race tracks in autonomous mode. It’s very cool. I don’t know how other companies are doing it without these resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t take everything from GM. We definitely do things differently, but it’s great to have those resources available to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Putting a secret driver in your autonomous vehicle research sounds like something from an episode of &lt;i&gt;Punk’d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to be creative and embrace ambiguity on the design and research team because we’re trying to answer questions about things that don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t like a traditional mobile web prototype that you’re asking people to walk through. We have to do Wizard of Oz prototyping or create paper and cardboard prototypes. We have to find ways to make the future feel like reality today because we can’t wait until our technology is ready to start developing the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Can you tell us more about the role customer research plays in developing Cruise’s autonomous vehicles?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Leadership Team is very user-centered. We spend a lot of time and resources out in the field, talking to people, testing, and iterating. We’re trying to figure out what people need to know to feel safe and comfortable. We are putting people in scenarios that might feel unsafe (but aren’t actually unsafe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to develop a product that’s not just technically safe but is perceived as safe and is exciting to be part of. We need to have our riders trust us before they get in, once they get in, and throughout the ride. This is something we’re constantly thinking about from a user experience and research perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often design for the happy path. We have to design for the unhappy path to avoid putting people in bad situations without guidance. They need to feel comfortable coming back and telling their friends about the experience. We don’t want this to be a ride that people take one time because it’s interesting. We want this to be how people get around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What kind of cross-cultural research do you conduct to understand how different riders worldwide interact with autonomous vehicles?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to think about a lot of things. So, for example, we’re in the process of planning cross-cultural research for our upcoming launch in Dubai. We need to think about their basic assumptions regarding self-driving vehicles in this new market. This impacts onboarding, marketing, and practically everything else. For example, do we need to convince them it’s safe? What are the feelings of safety and perceptions of safety of autonomous vehicles in this market? We also have to think about cultural norms in the UAE. For example, we know that we have to think about font size and pixel size when designing the UI. Arabic is less concise than English. It’s wordier, which means it will take up more space on the screen and buttons. And so there’s a lot we need to think about from a cultural perspective. So, we’re going to immerse ourselves and talk to people so we can understand all the things that the research and design team need to consider when designing for culturally different markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What advice would you give to researchers looking to have more impact in their organization?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your research going to help the company reach its OKRs? If not, you’re not working on the right things in my general perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my team is writing their quarterly or annual roadmaps around what they’re focused on, I ensure that their goals level up to our OKRs. Because if it’s nice to have, are they going to do something with it? Or is it just nice to know? If you don’t know what someone is going to do with the work you are doing, then you shouldn’t be doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The past, present, and future of technology with Genevieve Bell ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/genevieve-bell-technology-research</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/genevieve-bell-technology-research</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“I keep this line by William Gibson in my head most days,” begins Genevieve Bell. “‘The future’s already here, it’s just unevenly distributed.’ It’s a lovely provocation because it means if you know how to find it, you can find the future today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Genevieve Bell, a woman with far too many honorifics to list and a trail of letters after her name that seems to grow with each coming year, is seated across from me. A mass of curly red hair sits upon her head. She gestures in a way that gives me the impression she is literally pulling thoughts into the space around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From academic anthropology to one of the world’s foremost technological thinkers, Bell has walked the road less traveled and has some of the most acute observational skills to show for it. Her contributions to the field are manifold, but Bell is perhaps best known for her work at the Intel Corporation, where 20 years ago, she pioneered their social-science research division and is widely credited with establishing their User Experience capabilities. Outside of Intel, Bell has been consistently recognized for her work. In 2010, she was named one of the Top 25 Women in Technology to Watch by AlwaysOn and one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business by Fast Company. In 2012, Bell was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame, and in 2013, she was named Anita Borg’s Women of Vision in Leadership, to mention just a few of her accolades. To put it simply, Bell has earned her place as one of the most respected people in tech. And though it feels a little bit like requesting the Rolling Stones play ‘Satisfaction’, I’m asking Bell to predict the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 2020, I looked at Australia on fire, and I looked at the world’s response to that. And I thought, well, actually, this is a future, and it’s here,” Bell tells me. Though her message is alarming, she’s not an alarmist. Her tone is level, her posture relaxed. “In January of 2020, I remember saying to a lot of people; I think we’re in a moment in time when the technologies of the twenty-first century that we’re building our future on will turn out to be surprisingly dependent on technologies of the twentieth century,” Bell recounts. “And those technologies are more brittle than we ever imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Born to be an anthropologist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of renowned Australian anthropologist Diane Bell, Genevieve Bell, born in Sydney, Australia, was destined for academia. She spent her formative years on Australian university campuses, and her mother’s dining room table routinely hosted lively conversations about social justice, political reform, and change. She also spent time in remote Aboriginal settlements in the dusty center of the Australian continent. The combination of all these experiences has left Bell with an intellectual restlessness that would come to define her later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following in her mother’s footsteps, Bell studied anthropology in the United States, receiving her Ph.D. from the prestigious Stanford University in California’s Bay Area in 1998. Her doctoral thesis focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle_Indian_Industrial_School&quot;&gt;Carlisle Indian Industrial School&lt;/a&gt; (a boarding school for Native Americans established by the US Government around the turn of the century). A rising star in academia, her colleagues were shocked when she was offered a job at another Bay Area institution—the Intel Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technology and culture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking into Bell’s office in the 3A Institute at the Australian National University is like stepping into a microcosm of her mind. On one side of the room, Indigenous artworks are propped up against bookcases filled with literature covering everything from Foucault to futurology. Against one wall, there are dozens of lanyards for speaking events hanging like willow branches from a dark lacquered hatstand. Beside the hatstand, a circular traffic sign that reads: “YEAH!”. At one end of the office, a professional ring light for video live streams looms over an old wooden desk. Planning notes for the School of Cybernetics are scrawled in fluorescent pen across windowpanes overlooking the yard below. An assortment of knick-knacks, mugs from prestigious schools, and other miscellaneous swag line bookshelves and desks. Outside of Bell’s office, retro-futuristic murals splashed across the walls beckon passersby. To one side, a large whiteboard with a marker-pen caricature of Bell compares the historical development of the steam engine to the present-day story of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting together in this miniature mindscape, Bell reminisces about her childhood tours through the culturally diverse worlds of the southern hemisphere, drawing a thread between those early experiences and her contemporary work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thing about having grown up in Aboriginal communities and then anthropology departments was in both of those places, you come to realize technology is cultural,” Bell offers. “It exists inside a culture. It is a product of a culture. It carries cultural messages with it. When technology moves across contexts, it takes some of those messages, and it creates other kinds of challenges,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversations with Bell tend to wander. But not in a disjointed way. There’s a deftness to how she draws connections between history, technology, anthropology, society, and economics. Speaking with Bell demands you to be nimble. From our discussion about the culturally constructed elements of technology, we’re suddenly talking about the iconic industrialists who spawned them. “The ways we’ve talked about technology over the past 200 plus years in the West is always to erase the people who’ve made it except the one hero,” says Bell. “So James Watt and the steam engine, Stephenson and the Rocket,” she adds. “We tend to talk about technologies as if they just appeared out of nowhere. We don’t talk much about who funded them, what problem they were trying to solve, whether that problem was a shared problem, or whether that problem sits inside other stories and discourses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The veteran researcher uses the story of the steam engine—a recurring technological totem for Bell—to illustrate her point. In the early days of steam engines, Bell points out, the central function of rail transit in Britain was transporting coal from mines to the rest of the country. It made abundant sense to base the technology of the steam engine around locally available coal and water. “So now you’ve created a technology that carries with it in its fundamental constitution the place where it came from—and that place won’t be everywhere,” says Bell. “For me, when talking about technical systems, there’s this important piece of work in both trying to ground them in the places they come from and the places they are built, and also to be mindful about what it would mean to build new ones and carry that baggage forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future according to Bell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were somehow told that electricity was solved. And yet, we watched the lights blink out across New South Wales and Victoria during the bushfires of 2019 to 2020,” says Bell. We’re talking about the future. What I thought would be a discussion about robot butlers and flying cars is quickly turning into a high-level dissertation on the state of modern technical infrastructure. This is the future according to Bell. “In Australia, we watched the electrical grid fail. We watched the telecommunications grid fail. We watched the financial grid fail. We watched the internet fail. We watched civic and civil society not do their jobs,” she elaborates. “And so you suddenly ask, What if the technologies of the twentieth century are brittle and the twenty-first century just can’t be built on those things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear we are part of a series of systems. And those systems are both brittle and fragile and unexpectedly deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve these significant problems, Bell insists we have to employ a “systems viewpoint.” One that captures more than just the technical but goes beyond and implicates people, culture, government, and the environment. Moreover, Bell tells me that increasingly, technology will become more “specific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deglobalization of technology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s really clear in the past year what it means to be Italian during the COVID-19 pandemic was different than what it meant to be Taiwanese was different than what it meant to be Australian,” asserts Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we can take from the present is that the stories we need to tell about the future are going to have to be really specific.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bell, technological thinking will need to be located in a particular place, moment, and time, with a specific set of resources at its disposal. “Gone are the days of broad vision making technology,” she states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask if Bell means we need to start a deglobalization process with technology. She replies in true academic form. “Globalization was just a story. It’s a very good story. It’s a story we told compellingly. But it was never really &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt;,” Bell states. “Things moved across borders, but even a mobile phone in Australia might have had a global brand, but it was connected to a network that had different configurations. It did different things, and people did different things with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing localization effort in UX and software over the past ten years. As a result, more products and services are now designed with language and cultural adaptations that make them feel more natural for the end-user. Bell believes this trend will continue to be applied to technical systems “all the way through the stack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That localization could be because of ideas about government. It could be ideas about software capability. It could be because you have to manage a very particular set of constraints and configurations. Of course, we’re still always going to have global companies. But the desire for and the pragmatics of localized answers is an interesting piece of the puzzle at this particular moment in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of government in tech&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/why-people-really-love-technology-an-interview-with-genevieve-bell/265596/&quot;&gt;a previous interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;, the writer asked Bell about the future prospects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing&quot;&gt;ubiquitous computing&lt;/a&gt; (the integration of computing power into everyday objects and experiences). She responded by stating it was already a reality in places like Seoul. It may have been missed, Bell observes, because rather than private enterprise bringing the concept to fruition, it was “back-ended by a vision driven by city-states about notions of citizenship in the future. It had a form that was more interested in civic good than individual rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation gets to the heart of how we think about technology in society today and the differing agendas of public and private organizations. “I think it is important we remember that just as we can operate as consumers, we operate as citizens too,” she reminds us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell points out whenever a government has pushed a particular kind of technology, it’s done in a way that links technology consumption to an idea of citizenship and nationhood. “I’ve often looked at the technical systems governments have backed. Most governments have notions about equity of access,” says Bell, returning to the steam engine as an example. “In the 1800s, when the steam engine goes big in England, one of the very first pieces of regulation was about fare structures. The government understood that as this technology was going to scale, their role was to regulate access to it or to ensure that as many people could have access as possible,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You think about where the twenty-first century will go in terms of technologies, governments have a responsibility to ensure equity of access. They have a responsibility to ask the question, Does this technical system reproduce inequity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3Ai and cybernetics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of our time together, Bell and I are wandering the corridors of her latest big idea—the 3A Institute, which sits inside a larger School of Cybernetics at the Australian National University. Her goal is ambitious as ever—establishing a new branch of engineering to safely, sustainably, and responsibly take artificial intelligence to scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Institute has been running for three and a half years and has seen three cohorts of master’s students, and launched its own Ph.D. program in 2020. Recently, Bell pushed to have the Institute incorporated under the School of Cybernetics, the first of its kind in at least 50 years, the first-ever in Australia, and probably the only one ever to be run by a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Bell’s contemporaries, like Oxford University’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nickbostrom.com/&quot;&gt;Nick Bostrom&lt;/a&gt;, who heads up the ambitiously named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Future of Humanity Institute&lt;/a&gt;, have similar goals to Bell—tackling the development of artificial intelligence through a multi-disciplinary lens that incorporates philosophy, biology, computer science, and governance. Bostrom has stated in the past that AI is the greatest existential threat to humankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that intelligent machines are destined to replace humans or, at the very worst, kill us all, is a recurring theme in popular culture. But Bell is pragmatic. Like a true anthropologist, for her, the popular imagining of artificial intelligence says more about our collective cultural experiences than it does about the threat of killer robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The arc of the twentieth century is humans watching technical systems be used to do the worst things that humans have done to each other. The idea we might imagine that as part and parcel of that story is not difficult,” Bell affirms. “But I’m sitting somewhere between the ways in which technology occupies our imaginations and the ways it’s occupied our daily lives. And so, it’s always tempting to say people are being silly when they are frightened of robots. But I think you have to say that fear is the product of centuries of accumulated experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell argues we can mitigate the risks of artificial intelligence through training, regulation, and law enforcement. Her mission is to create a framework for artificial intelligence to be brought to scale safely. To that end, perhaps it’s a given that she would advocate for a systemic approach to regulating AI rather than doomsday thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Bostrom may be sounding the alarm about artificial intelligence’s threat to humankind, but I get the impression Bell is more optimistic. She disagrees. “I don’t think it’s about optimism or pessimism. I think it’s about knowing that what we have in 2021 isn’t necessarily the world I want for my future,” she argues. “It’s less that I’m optimistic or pessimistic and more that I’m just a builder,” Bell remarks. “Maybe what I’m optimistic about is that we could build something different.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating a research culture with Atlassian's Leisa Reichelt]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/creating-a-research-culture</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/creating-a-research-culture</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, management teams might prefer that products were built by ultra-intuitive engineering teams deeply connected to the customer and their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is (perhaps thankfully) not the case. Deep customer understanding is fast becoming the key differentiating factor in the success or failure of a product, and leaders are utilizing research across the business to help make clear-eyed strategic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the apparent benefits, at Dovetail we often hear how hard it can be to convince leaders to invest in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/leisareichelt/?originalSubdomain=au&quot;&gt;Leisa Reichelt&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Research and Insights at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, is no stranger to this dilemma. After heading up UX teams overseeing the digital transformation of public services in the UK and Australia, Reichelt landed at Atlassian three and a half years ago when the software giant had yet to embrace customer research with the sophistication it does today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, Reichelt spurred on the expansion of Atlassian’s research capability from a few researchers scattered around the organization into a sizeable team of hard-nosed professionals. It’s fair to say she understands, on a deep level, what it means to change an organization’s culture by thoroughly and convincingly advocating for the benefits of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Proof is in the pudding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going in and pitching for large research investment is probably a foolish thing to do first up,” states Reichelt. “The way to build a research culture is through value creation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to do this. The first is to make sure the work is useful to the team immediately and that it helps to build their sense of purpose and connection to the customer. “Part of the reason they get up in the morning and go do their job is that they feel connected to the customers they’re doing the work for,” she enthuses. “The other way to add value is to make sure your team feels a greater degree of confidence in the decisions that they’re making, and they don’t want to be without that confidence anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Support the organization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember that the value of research isn’t limited to a cross-functional software team. There are many opportunities for research to contribute at the wider organizational level. Discovery or usability testing aren’t the only weapons in a researcher’s arsenal. Show the impact research has by looking for opportunities to contribute to company-wide goals and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are opportunities to link the research you want to do to an area where your organization wants to go,” says Reichelt. “It might be fueling content creation for marketing, or helping gain press attention via thought leadership research—there are lots of ways to create value for an organization where you can actually look at the ROI and confidently say, ‘This research costs this much, and this is the value we’re going to get back.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to bring leadership on the journey, Reichelt stresses. Whether you’re working within a team or on a corporate level, linking research to tangible outcomes and an ROI is essential to win over management and foster a culture of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There’s no I in research—do it as a team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no value in conducting the research if the team isn’t truly connecting to their customer and applying what they learn to the product. To accomplish this, it’s important to work openly and involve stakeholders throughout the process. One way to achieve this (and, importantly, track and measure it) is what Atlassian refers to as “exposure hours.” Borrowed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uie.com/&quot;&gt;UIE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Spool&quot;&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt;, exposure hours at Atlassian are regular, scheduled sessions for all team members to observe customers using their product or a competitor’s product. According to Reichelt, it’s been shown that this relatively simple concept is most likely to lead to teams who create products or services with the best user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to success, says Reichelt, is to set a clear goal (two hours every six weeks). “We have set exposure hours as one of our research team OKRs this year. Each month, we share back to the organization how we are tracking against that goal and which teams and people are getting the most exposure hours by coming to research and observing their customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps people realize that observing research is everyone’s real job,” states Reichelt. “As an engineer, spending an hour watching a customer using the software is &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; work. It’s not what you do if you happen not to have a ticket that you’re picking up right now. It’s not something that you do if you have spare time. It’s real, proper work that’s going to help you make better decisions within the team and as an individual engineer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Know thy team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Reichelt has explored varying approaches to her team’s organizational structure, using a combination of centralized research teams and researchers embedded in cross-functional teams. Today at Atlassian, they use a combination of these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind the different structures was to optimize the research team’s effectiveness in each organizational context. Different factors affecting the context could include research capacity and ratios, maturity and experience of the researchers in the team, through to overall maturity of the organization’s research culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had embedded researchers when I was first at Atlassian, but we didn’t have a strong research culture at all,” explains Reichelt. “We didn’t have any real sense of exactly what research meant for us, and how we did it, what we believed in, what good looked like—that kind of thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason we went centralized in the first instance was to accelerate that rise in capability. It certainly wasn’t because I thought that was ultimately the best way to work, because I think cross-functional and embedded working is absolutely critical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we didn’t have the culture. We needed to pull together and work out who we were, what we did, and to feel comfortable and capable in that before we were able to go back  as individual researchers and do that in all the different teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strike a balance. Iterate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with a growing headcount, a significant challenge for Reichelt still prevails: How do we prioritize the seemingly endless amount of research needed with a finite number of researchers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relatively simple response is to make a list of all the most critical work and allocate your team accordingly. “That seems sensible because then your most important research work gets done by the people who are most capable,” says Reichelt. “Except what can happen then is that you can slowly make your researchers miserable because they are constantly moving from project to project. They are never &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; part of the cross-functional delivery team, and they never get to see anything through to the customers’ hands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s super, super hard to try to get that balance right: making sure that you’re working on the most important questions, but you’re doing it in a way that creates rewarding work experience for the researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feels like a chess game that we play all the time, trying to work out where to play people and how to play people to get the best result,” she says. “The organization changes. It just changes naturally. It also changes a little bit in response to what you are doing. You have to keep iterating your approach regularly. You can’t just go, ‘Alright, we’ve set everybody in place, and now we can all just put our heads down and do what we’re doing.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of research at Atlassian&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may come as no surprise, but Leisa Reichelt’s priority for 2021 is to drive even more cross-functionality within Atlassian’s teams and to ensure everyone deeply understands and connects with the customer problems they are solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reichelt sums it up: “The really exciting thing about human-centered cross-functional work is we all center it on the thing we care about the most, which is meeting the customer’s needs as best we can. By approaching it cross-functionally, we bring all the different skills we have together to solve that problem collectively. And that to me is where you have the best, most exciting teamwork with the highest potential to deliver really great products and services—when we’re coming at it with all of all the things that we know and can do, centered on that customer’s experience,” she finishes, then laughs, “I feel like I need a couple of hallelujahs in there or something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher, Reichelt is a fierce advocate for human-centered design; she sees it as her role to help to “unleash the potential of every team,” pushing developers and designers to make products that people actually need and want to use. While this makes perfect business sense, there’s almost a deeper philosophy at play here. There are too many examples of building for building’s sake, too much time, effort, and talent wasted time on products that nobody asked for. Beyond work, there ought to be a purpose behind the things we make. That’s the impression I’m left with after speaking with Leisa Reichelt. And now I feel like I need a couple of hallelujahs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The secret behind Four Pillars’ world-beating title]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-secret-behind-four-pillars-world-beating-title</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/the-secret-behind-four-pillars-world-beating-title</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We’re sitting in the newest addition to the brand’s brick and mortar offerings, the Four Pillars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fourpillarsgin.com/drinks-lab/visit&quot;&gt;Gin Lab&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney’s Surry Hills. The bar is quiet, refined. Elegant but unpretentious. Gregor is doing what he does best—talking about gin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PR man, journo, booze dude, MC, auctioneer, and business and marketing gun—if it involves raconteuring or alcohol, Gregor seems poised to take it on. His CV is an eclectic mix of wine-making, alcohol writing, the odd not-for-profit involvement, and lifestyle public relations (he founded &lt;a href=&quot;http://liquidideas.com.au/&quot;&gt;Liquid Ideas&lt;/a&gt;, one of Australia’s most successful lifestyle PR firms in 2000, only stepping back from a leadership role in 2017). To put it in simple terms: Gregor has been talking and drinking professionally for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the long list of bona fides before his name and Four Pillars’ stellar performance over the past seven years, Gregor isn’t what you would expect from a highly successful business owner. He’s far more entertaining, for one, possessing a good-humored patter that naturally draws others into his often hilarious, often insightful, often strange world (he spent a few minutes explaining the innovation of Cottonelle toilet paper—one durable ply, as opposed to multiple, pressed plies—“genius,” he remarked, only to then jump into a quick-fire dissertation on his fondness for anchovies). There is a Boomer jocularity to him recognizable in uncles at a Christmas party after the third or fourth beer, telling tall tales of yesteryear. And no matter how much he may find himself at the center of attention, there’s little apparent need on his part to be there. He rolls out line after line of storytelling gold, simply for the love of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregor’s Four Pillars story started in 2013 with a copper still called Wilma, named after co-founder Cameron Mackenzie’s late mother. After that, a distillery was founded in Healesville, tucked away in Victoria’s Yarra Valley. Here, along with his two co-founders, they launched what would soon become one of the biggest Australian food and beverage success stories of the past ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a little Aussie distillery on the outskirts of Melbourne to winning the most sought after prize in the world of booze—International Gin Producer of the Year in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwsc.net/&quot;&gt;International Wine and Spirits Competition&lt;/a&gt;, the alcohol equivalent of taking out Best Film at the Oscars—Four Pillars’ journey is built on a solid foundation of product and customer obsession, and is one any aspiring founder should look to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gin-ovate the market&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of Four Pillars’ offerings, the usual hallmarks of quality are ever-present—fresh, locally sourced ingredients, cutting-edge processes, and clear-headed dedication to the craft and its results. But where Gregor and his co-founders’ genuinely excel is in their willingness to experiment and innovate—bringing to life a huge variety of unique gins to accommodate even the most fickle of palates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Four Pillars’ most well-known competitors, Hendricks, is famous for its market penetration with a single flagship product. “You either like it, or you don’t, but that’s the only one they’re going to make for you,” chimes Gregor. “What we do, unlike some companies, particularly in the past, is we don’t try to tell everyone they should like one product. We started on a totally different plane, which was to make lots of different gins. And you’re going to like one of them. You might like the one with the olives. You might like the one with Shiraz. You might like the one with the barrel aging. You might like the one with the exotic botanicals—but we’re going to make you a suite of gins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, developing their market has undoubtedly contributed to Four Pillars’ success, helping them unlock previously untapped segments of gin drinkers. But it’s what he says next that catches me off guard. While many would argue that significant product testing and market validation is important when developing a commercial strategy, Gregor and co are far more cavalier. “There was no latent desire or need for an Australian gin, right?” he ventured. “If you’d gone to 20 bartenders and said, what are you missing behind your bar? Not one of them would have said an Australian gin. We would’ve walked back and thought, ‘Well, why would we make an Australian gin?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to back yourself to some degree to make a product. The people don’t know they need it until they taste something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gin-credible customer experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A top-shelf product, the right price point, and all the market knowledge available is all well and good, but it isn’t enough to make you a world champion. Gregor shares his insight into how deep customer understanding has helped him develop a customer experience worthy of taking home the title. “Once you’re a brand and you’re a product—once you’re real—that’s when customer feedback becomes everything,” says the gin man. “From the product, hospitality, experience, website—all of the elements of our business—the customer gives us so much feedback. And our job is to listen, adapt, and to always respond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the primary and fundamental goal of all businesses; the better you understand your customers, the more you’re able to figure out what a customer wants,” he says, cautiously tending to a large glass of green tea in front of him. “And that is no different, whether they want a piece of software from Dovetail or they want a beautiful gin experience at Four Pillars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the proclamations organizations and their leaders make around customer obsession, it’s still easy at times to forget there’s a human on the other side of the product. But Gregor, the PR, and marketing man and hospitality industry veteran, has worked at the coalface of customer experience for two decades. This is probably why Rick Baker, Co-Founder of Australian VC company Blackbird Ventures, invited Gregor to talk at his organization. “I had Rick in here only two nights ago. We were talking about the similarities between his business and ours, and how he wants to teach his business the skills that we have in hospitality,” Gregor chirps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot that can be learned from each other. There are so many core fundamentals that are the same, regardless if somebody is selling software or gin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregor is building up steam now, his rapid-fire verbal style filling the room. There’s a gleam in his eye as he drops wisdom with the energy of a 40-megaton bomb. “If you are an arrogant, dismissive, conceited, up yourself, fuckwit business, you’re going to go out of business, doesn’t matter who you are,” Gregor opines. “If you are a generous, thoughtful, considerate, hardworking, honest, and diligent business, you will fucking succeed. Right? And that’s the truth for the Dolphin Hotel as it is for the goddamned Atlassian boys, as it is for Blackbird and Four Pillars.” Despite the colorful language, Gregor is deadly serious. And he’s not wrong, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The gins and outs of customer obsession&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer experience is increasingly one of the most critical areas for businesses to gain a competitive advantage, a fact not lost in the broader business community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global research advisory firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.customerthermometer.com/customer-service/customer-service-and-satisfaction-statistics-for-2020/&quot;&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; revealed that in 2019, more than 50 percent of organizations had redirected their investments to customer experience innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rewards are there. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumoa.me/customer-experience-stats&quot;&gt;Forrester study &lt;/a&gt;in 2016, customer-obsessed businesses are seven times more relevant to customers and five times more likely to be a top provider of products, and four times more profitable. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://omoto.io/academy/customer-experience-statistics/&quot;&gt;Temkin Group&lt;/a&gt;, even a moderate improvement in CX would impact the revenue of a typical $1 billion company by an average of $775 million over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no secret ingredient in the Four Pillars’ mix. For them, becoming customer-focused is about sweating the details and making organizational and cultural shifts that place the needs of human beings first. During our conversation, Gregor is more than willing to share what he’s learned about running a world-class, customer-obsessed business. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Put the customer experience front of mind.&lt;/i&gt; “First of all, try to figure out things that people are gonna really genuinely love, and then deliver it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bad experiences have an outsized impact on your business.&lt;/i&gt; “People come here and have one bad buyer experience. They’re very inclined to tell others about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Find ways to deliver fantastic customer service, no matter where in their journey your customer is.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“You always want to make the first ones feel special, but you also don’t want someone to feel like they’ve missed out if they only joined the Four Pillars family last week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The importance of your team and integrating customer understanding on every level of the business.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“It’s about maintaining that culture within the organization, such that everyone feels a special place within the business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The experience has to be authentic and true to the brand.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“The days of glossy smoke-and-mirrors type experiences are well behind us. Be transparent about the process and the commitment to the craft.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make it easy and fun.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“People don’t want complicated and boring. That’s Life in 2020 – brands like ours need to make interactions simple and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be honest, and say thank you.&lt;/i&gt; “If you stuff up, apologize. If you can’t do something, don’t promise it in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don’t take good customers for granted.&lt;/i&gt; “Always ensure the most loyal get the best offers, the newest and shiniest gin toys. Even if it’s only a day before the rest of the world, they appreciate it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Just the be-&lt;i&gt;gin&lt;/i&gt;-ing for Four Pillars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding a certain viral pandemic, the Healesville distillery in Victoria expects to see a surge of visitors coming from all parts of the world to try the number one gin. Gregor admits the pressure is on. “Every one of those new customers is going to come with increased expectations because now they think we’re famous. Now they’re walking into the bar saying, ‘I’m going to have the world’s best gin experience.’ That’s a much higher bar,” he confides. But then again, bars are precisely what Gregor and co are so good at. And with brewing giant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/companies/retail/beer-giant-lion-buys-half-of-four-pillars-gin-20190320-p515wk&quot;&gt;Lion Nathan&lt;/a&gt; having bought a 50 percent share in the company just last year, Four Pillars gin is set to explode at home and across the globe. (Knocking Hendricks off as Australia’s highest-selling premium gin is the first item on the list, says Gregor).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Wilma, that little still in Victoria’s Yarra Valley? Now she’s joined by a few more copper friends: Jude, Eileen, Beth, and Coral. All named after the founders’ mothers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building a shared brain for customer knowledge with Atlassian’s Sherif Mansour ]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/interview-atlassian-sherif-mansour</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/interview-atlassian-sherif-mansour</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is a story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherifmansour/&quot;&gt;Sherif Mansour&lt;/a&gt;, Distinguished Product Manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/&quot;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;, loves to tell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a common refrain among the industry’s senior PM cohort. More than ten years ago, when Mansour started his professional journey, the role had barely left its adolescence, and there was little to nothing to speak of in the realm of official product management qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From graduate engineer (“I was a terrible engineer,” he says) to the inimitably titled “Distinguished Product Manager” at one of the world’s most innovative software companies, Mansour’s career almost perfectly parallels the rise of product management from relative obscurity to a role that’s been referred to as the CEO of product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put this in perspective, Mansour’s first foray into the profession landed him on Atlassian’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence&quot;&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt; team back when it had 15 people on board. “There was a part-time designer. And so I was in design for half the time. And that was it. But we had no researchers. We had no analysts,” says Mansour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the rise of specialist designers, researchers, and analysts, and an ever-growing subset of specialties emerging each year, the role of product manager has changed, but according to Mansour, the core principle — to solve customer problems — remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What makes a great product manager?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a role as central to the product development process as a product manager, the term still has a nebulous feel. It’s strange to think that out of the billions of customers worldwide receiving new products and features every year, most of them probably don’t know anything about the people who make it happen. According to Mansour:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A product manager is the person who identifies the customer need and the broader business objectives that a product or feature will fulfill, articulates what success looks like for a product, and rallies a team to turn that vision into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply — a product manager spends their days trying to understand what customers want and then figuring out ways to give it to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it still feels vague, that’s because the role is so varied in scope and scale, single definitions rarely capture the whole concept. A product manager has a broad set of responsibilities and several different tools at their disposal for problem-solving, meaning on the individual level and organizational level, styles and approaches vary, often significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the question, &lt;b&gt;what makes a great product manager&lt;/b&gt;, yields a multivariate response from the Atlassian veteran. “It depends on the context of the organization and what they’re trying to do,” he says. “In a startup, you might not be necessarily looking for a product manager that can lead because you’ve got a founder, but you’re looking for someone who can execute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In that case, you’re looking at taking a blurry vision from someone else and trying to define it, trying to validate it and doing research to convince the startup at the time that this is the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in larger organizations, Mansour explains, product managers put more time into “navigating the organizational landscape to get an outcome” — that is, getting buy-in from leadership, as well as stakeholders — all while focusing on the market landscape to ensure the viability of the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating a shared brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Mansour, at the highest level, the product manager provides three robust solutions for their team:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fostering empathy by centering the customer and their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speeding up decision making, so the team works more productively and cohesively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owning the roadmap for product development and helping their teams understand what problems they are solving, when, and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, most organizations say a PM owns a roadmap, a spec, and a backlog,” says Mansour. “What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a roadmap, a spec, and a backlog? They’re all solutions. What problems are those artifacts trying to solve when you go back?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The roadmap, spec, and backlog] try to give you a shared context of the high-level vision and how you’ll go about executing it. They give you some context on what problem you want to solve and how you’ll be able to deliver value to customers incrementally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mansour calls it “creating a shared brain,” and it’s the product manager’s full-time responsibility. From influencing teams without authority to getting decisions made and shipping products, it all relies on the product manager’s ability to get the whole team on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The rise of specialists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The days where Mansour worked on small engineering teams with part-time designers and no analysts or researchers are over. As the market demands higher quality, customer-centric products, specialists of all shades and colors have emerged to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product managers were once the fount of all customer knowledge. When it came to design thinking or customer research, they were keenly connected to the market, and were often the most ardent advocate for the end-user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with a rise in specialist researchers, analysts, and designers, often all with their own sub-specialties, is the product manager’s role being eroded? Is there a rising tide of tension developing between the different decision-makers, all of whom claim to be the voice of the customer to some extent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of specialists [like researchers] often creates anxiety, I guess, and a bit of tension for product managers, because some of them say, ‘I was talking to customers, now I have a researcher. What do they do? I was the person doing UX validation testing. Now, what does my full-time designer do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration is key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As research and design specialists join the fray, a PM doesn’t risk seeing their contributions diminished, but rather they may fall into a trap where they become akin to a project manager, supervising the handover of various tasks from one specialist to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I tell people to do is to conduct the discovery process (learning what is it we’re trying to solve and how might we solve it) as a shared working group, not a set of individuals,” says the seasoned PM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anti-pattern is to take your specialist researcher, and you tell them to do their job and produce an artifact for that role.” Instead, what works better, according to Mansour, is specialists democratizing their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real specialists that shine are the ones that say, how do I make a researcher out of everyone? Or the UX specialist says, how do I make a UXR out of everyone? Not because someone could get trained in research overnight and have a Ph.D., but because they realize it’s the best way they can influence others and add value to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does this leave the product manager? In Mansour’s opinion, a good product manager can’t simply be a generalist, nor should they fall into a project manager role where they oversee the handover of various specialist functions in the product development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say that good product managers have one leg of the stool that they know well.” Mansour refers to an idea called the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-you-love-triangle-joff-redfern/&quot;&gt;PM Craft triangle&lt;/a&gt;’ (a term coined by the current VP of Product at Atlassian, Joff Redfern). The concept is that product managers are a mix of artist, scientist, and general manager, with one corner of that triangle usually preferred to others. “In my experience, I haven’t met many great PMs that are in the middle,” states Mansour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I form a team, I’m very conscious of the kind of PM I need for the work and how I can complement their skillset,” says Mansour. “If you put three people that think alike in a room, of course, there’s going to be overlapping skills and confusion as to who does what. I think what that helps us do is build a more deliberate team formation. It’s about a balanced view where we make sure we complement each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of product management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of our conversation, we talk about the increasing number of sub-specialties within design, engineering, and research. The question is, will product managers, or &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; product managers go in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialization might take the form of the PM triangle made explicit in role titles. A strong data analyst would differ from a business- or UX-oriented product manager, and the titles they hold could reflect those strengths. While Mansour acknowledges it would make it easier for hiring purposes, he’s cautious about endorsing the concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if that’s good for our discipline as a whole, because we start to encourage an insular view of what the job is trying to do, which is really to be a shepherd for our customer problem,” says Mansour. “Those job titles are how I approach solutions to those problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe it’s the purist in me at the end of the day, but the exceptional product managers are those that fall in love with the problem space and do everything they can to improve that problem space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we want to motivate the discipline to focus on that rather than start with a specialist solution in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our desire for beauty]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/our-desire-for-beauty</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/our-desire-for-beauty</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I think it’s &lt;u&gt;ultimately inhuman to only see things for their functionality&lt;/u&gt;.

Whispers &amp;amp; Giants run ethnographic field research all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Pascal has conducted research for international corporations and non-profits, ranging from the adoption of mobile money in the Horn of Africa, migration, aging and social work in Switzerland, futures of mobility and social credit systems in China and IoT security in the shifting energy market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascal is also a regular speaker on the topic of cross-generational intelligence at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imd.org/&quot;&gt;IMD&lt;/a&gt; in Lausanne, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imd.org/lda/digital-transformation-leadership/&quot;&gt;Leading in a Digital Age&lt;/a&gt; program, and he’s also a guest critic at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epfl-ecal-lab.ch/&quot;&gt;EPFL+ECAL Lab&lt;/a&gt; design research and innovation center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the photos included in this article have been taken by Pascal in the field while researching the future of megacities in Hong Kong, the adoption of organic rice farming in Vietnam, and the future of education in Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s your organization’s mission?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pascal:&lt;/i&gt; About twelve years ago—after quite a while in the agency world doing creative direction in branding and UX—I started learning and putting into practice the frameworks of future research. Later, thanks to the work related to the scanning of early signals of change and socio-cultural trends, I studied how qualitative research is practiced by academics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I have started my own design and strategy studio called Whispers &amp;amp; Giants. Its mission is to help organizations make sense of the world, with both its growing problems and with its diversity of life and intelligence. I help leaders reframe challenges, make sense of change, and imagine positive futures and new services or products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does user research work at Whispers &amp;amp; Giants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pascal:&lt;/i&gt; Exploration projects usually require us to interview and observe people in a lot of different contexts. When the client takes part in the initial sampling of participants, this part of the process usually reveals a lot about the client’s ‘dark matter’. These insights upstream of the research are often very helpful not only for the design of the delivery but also help build the story about the research during the project. It also helps unpack the assumptions and biases we’re swimming in at the start of projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in order to truly make sense of the rules, you need to cross some institutional boundaries and see how the system reacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More and more research involves mapping the interactions between users and the backstage reality of services. For example, when exploring the reality of migrants hosted in Swiss underground bomb shelters—as traditional housing structures were overwhelmed by massive arrivals—the key in our approach was a positive collaboration with the local staff and their partners. Sometimes, in order to truly make sense of the rules, you need to cross some institutional boundaries and see how the system reacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could you describe a recent user research project?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pascal:&lt;/i&gt; I recently explored the future of business schools from a future customer perspective and to unpack the narrative of degree programs (MBAs) for tomorrow’s generations. There, we used a mix of in-depth interviews, shadowing, jobs to be done and service design blueprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working and presenting to faculty teachers, we needed to make sure our sampling process, our triangulation, coding, and saturation was rock-solid. An auditorium packed with forty world-class faculties is not like the usual strategic committee. The biggest surprise in this research was how many stories exist across organizational boundaries as deep social realities. It revealed a lot about how, in the face of our global shifts and challenges, the current corporate vanilla culture was becoming a thin and cracking veneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What software does your organization use? What have you tried in the past? What’s been working well?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pascal:&lt;/b&gt; We rely a lot on &lt;a href=&quot;https://notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;. Notion is extremely powerful and allows us an incredible degree of customization and scalability. For specific tasks, we rely on apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.experiencefellow.com/&quot;&gt;Experience Fellow&lt;/a&gt; which can be really helpful. Otherwise, besides using &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt; a lot now, in the past, I’ve relied on the traditional combo of notepads and tons of sticky notes for data walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What challenges do you have with user research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pascal:&lt;/i&gt; The biggest challenge is more and more on the side of the client’s immune system and metabolism. Today’s issues require us to overcome a lot of internal status quo and collapse of the collective imaginary. This is not an easy time for many actors, and it’s important to take that into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many societies are primarily contributive and not salary-based. This fundamentally changes the social fabric of how people and families rely on each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, when working with westerners it isn’t always easy to overcome some cultural barriers in their difficulties to understand and interact with different ways of being or belonging to the world. For example, in many cultures and languages, the use of the “I” pronoun is fundamentally different from how a westerner would conceive it and often expresses a collective “we”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How time is perceived also means a lot. Many societies are primarily contributive and not salary-based. This fundamentally changes the social fabric of how people and families rely on each other. Then there is time perception, fate, or health cultural models that deeply differ from the western perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s changing about user research at Whispers &amp;amp; Giants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pascal:&lt;/i&gt; I think it’s about going beyond the design culture of research where the notion validity is not always a well-defined concept. I find myself doing more and more ‘sensemaking interviews’ where I mix workshop techniques of mapping and visualization with more divergent thinking cognitive modes in order to weave stories and internal strategic insights across business units and silos. This is becoming a really fast and effective way of providing teams with a mutual clarity and common ground, and it’s a really fun moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do you do what you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pascal:&lt;/i&gt; I started this company with a few aims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First I think there is my inner curiosity and need to travel to explore the world. Then, I really think that the business world is stuck with counterproductive myths and models. Therefore in the face of our civilizational challenges, imagination is fundamental to escape the weight of the past. And finally about research, not only is the whole exploratory and digging process fascinating, but the coding work is among the most pleasant things to do. I’ve always had a taste for complex and entangled problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Any advice for new user researchers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pascal:&lt;/i&gt; I was doing design research like many designers with the academic approach and discipline in my blind spot. Then I got really lucky to work with talented researchers that showed me a couple of tricks about sampling, snowballing, and saturation. I would recommend taking the time to examine the different approaches to coding and what they mean for the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you interact with another culture, it usually reveals a lot about yourself; your worldview. And in my opinion that’s a really good start. You can’t think out of the box, unless you start to define it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having lived in Africa for quite a while working with westerners who were there on missions, I noticed how much of an issue ethnocentrism really is. It’s not limited to white Europeans though. For example, the Chinese I met in Mozambique were also experiencing it, yet from a totally different angle. When you interact with another culture, it usually reveals a lot about yourself; your worldview. And in my opinion, that’s a really good start. You can’t think out of the box, unless you start to define it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up without TV, so I’m a radio addict. In terms of podcasts, I enjoy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popularfront.co/podcast&quot;&gt;Popular Front Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hiddenforces.io/podcasts&quot;&gt;Hidden Forces&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://anchor.fm/emerge&quot;&gt;Emerge&lt;/a&gt;.

The 17-year-old Australian software company boasts 130,000 plus customers in more than 165 countries around the world, ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spotify.com/&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lyft.com/&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verizon.com/&quot;&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlassian’s design and research team has grown immensely in the past few years since their 2015 Initial Public Offering (IPO). They now have over 370 people in research, design, and product roles, working across more than a dozen products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alanstairs&quot;&gt;Alastair Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, who leads part of the design team at Atlassian, to learn more about how the software giant approaches design, user research, and talking to customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s Atlassian’s mission?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alastair:&lt;/i&gt; Atlassian builds software that helps teams organize, discuss, and collaborate on their work. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software&quot;&gt;more than a dozen products&lt;/a&gt;, but the most popular are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jira Software&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – Our flagship product, the number one tool for planning and releasing software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confluence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – A shared workspace that enables information sharing and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/software/trello&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trello&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – An intuitive, super-simple project management tool for anything from home remodeling to managing a supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We firmly believe that behind every great human achievement there is a team. From medicine and space travel, to disaster response and pizza deliveries, our products help teams all over the planet advance humanity through the power of software. Our mission is to unleash the potential of every team through open work. Solving team collaboration is an incredibly interesting, challenging, and rewarding domain to work in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does your design team work with user research across the organization?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alastair:&lt;/i&gt; Our design teams are embedded into our different products and they sit alongside product managers and engineers. We also have some of the research team embedded alongside these cross-functional teams so they can effectively partner on product-specific research efforts; for example, task-based testing of new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting the customer at the heart of everything you do is essential to building great products…everyone on a project should have regular exposure hours with customers and increasing the hours teams have to interact with customers is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have a dedicated set of researchers organized around the ‘Top Tasks’ of our customers. This follows the Gerry McGovern methodology of ‘Top Tasks’. The benefit of this for Atlassian is that it allows us to focus on the problems our customers have versus how our products have chosen to try and solve that problem. Putting the customer at the heart of everything you do is essential to building great products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know our Head of Research, Leisa Reichelt, and myself are both fans of this term: “Research, as a team”. It flows through into “Design, as a team” and even “Roadmap, as a team”. Everyone on a cross-functional group who are tasked with solving a particular problem should all work together as a team throughout the project. Regular collaboration versus long periods of siloed work will definitely lead to a stronger result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also means that everyone on a project should have regular exposure hours with customers and increasing the hours teams have to interact with customers is vitally important. It helps everyone align and get a shared understanding of the customer problems they are trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What software does Atlassian use? What have you tried in the past? What’s been working well?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alastair:&lt;/i&gt; We obviously use the Atlassian suite of products quite extensively as you would imagine. My teams use Jira, Trello, and Confluence every day. We also use design tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sketch.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.framer.com/&quot;&gt;Framer&lt;/a&gt;. Communication all happens via &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things I learned when I joined Atlassian was that each team planned their work and used our tools in their own unique ways. Some teams would follow a loose Kanban workflow. Some may run more traditional Scrum. Some teams document everything in Confluence and others rely on Jira issues or Trello cards. Teams are free to work the way that best suits them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For recruitment specific activities we use tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt; to schedule sessions with participants. Most customer interviews are conducted and recorded via Zoom and then saved to our central repository of work and sometimes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;. The whole organization also uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usertesting.com/&quot;&gt;UserTesting&lt;/a&gt; for unmoderated usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team have also started running cross-company training with every discipline at Atlassian. This helps everyone at the company conduct better quality research work and ensures we base product decisions on high-quality insights from our customers. You can read more about the changes to how we have set up our research organization in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.marvelapp.com/kate-towsey-researchops-atlassian&quot;&gt;this great interview by our Research Ops Lead, Kate Towsey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our design and research teams are distributed across multiple offices and home office locations across the world, they rely heavily on tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://mural.co/&quot;&gt;Mural&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate on analysis across timezones. Sharing of findings—other than the direct in-person sharing sessions that happen throughout projects—is achieved via Confluence. Atlassian has a thriving Confluence setup where pretty much everything is stored and communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s changing about how you interact with customers at your organization?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alastair:&lt;/i&gt; Atlassian has always had a strong sense of listening to our customers, but traditionally we have always spoken to a specific type of customer: the administrator who sets up the Jira or Confluence instance inside an organization. Whilst this type of customer remains hugely important for us, we have also started to listen to the end-users of our products more since they are the ones who are using our products day in and day out to manage and track tasks. This is what has driven a lot of the simplification of our products that has been happening over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally you will find that the interesting problems to solve are being tackled by companies that have a strong mission and set of values as their foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers have also been organized around a set of core “top tasks”. This was a big change for us as a company from a purely embedded model of researchers inside of products. But having a set of centralized researchers going deep on customer problems has been enormously impactful for the entire company and our product teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of both qualitative and quantitative data: we are on the journey that most companies are on. We are trying to triangulate multiple reliable data inputs and turn them into actionable and meaningful customer insights to help us build better products for our customers. This is an easy sentence to state, but incredibly hard to get right at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do you do what you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alastair:&lt;/i&gt; When I think about why I work anywhere, I follow a relatively simple framework:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is the person I am working for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are the people I am working with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What problem are we trying to solve, and therefore what impact can I have in the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think people often make the mistake to follow a particular vertical (e.g. banking, entertainment) or a fast-growing trend (e.g. mobile). I know I did early on in my career. When really most of what we all do day to day is solve problems with people. And so it makes sense that the type of problem you are solving you are passionate about, and you enjoy working with the people who are alongside you and helping you solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, you will find that the interesting problems to solve are being tackled by companies that have a strong mission and set of values as their foundation. This attracts a diverse and interesting set of people who you can learn from and grow your own career. Certainly, this is what keeps me at Atlassian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Any advice for new designers or user researchers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alastair:&lt;/i&gt; There are many many places to start for new designers and researchers, My first design book was the classic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/books/design-everyday-things-revised/&quot;&gt;Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman&lt;/a&gt;. For great research specific updates, folks should subscribe to Leisa Reichelt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/leisa&quot;&gt;email newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other advice I give anyone starting in design and research, is to just do the work and find a strong mentor to give you direct feedback. You will learn more by doing and then listening to feedback on how to improve from peers you respect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interview with Mary Mikhail, UX Researcher at Kira Systems]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/interview-mary-mikhail</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/interview-mary-mikhail</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kirasystems.com/&quot;&gt;Kira Systems&lt;/a&gt; is a Toronto-based machine learning startup building software that allows users to train models to extract information out of contracts. Primarily designed for lawyers to assist with legal review, Kira has been growing steadily over the past three years and now has 165 employees including an 11 person design and research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We interviewed Mary Mikhail, a User Experience Researcher at Kira Systems, to learn more about how they approach user research in a growing startup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tell us about Kira Systems&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; During mergers and acquisitions, lawyers work on diligence that involves heavy contract review. Kira was initially developed for that use case by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nwaisb&quot;&gt;Noah Waisberg&lt;/a&gt;, who thought there ought to be a better way of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind our technology is the co-founder and CTO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/akhudek&quot;&gt;Dr. Alexander Hudek&lt;/a&gt;. Although initially developed for a specific use case (M&amp;amp;A due diligence), Kira is now proving to be of value in a multitude of other use cases such as lease abstraction, deal points studies, finance, compliance, contract metadata projects, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How does user research work across the organization?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; Kira has grown exponentially from the handful of employees working here in 2014, to about 165 people now. As with any quickly growing organization, process is constantly a work in progress. Luckily, design and research have been a core focus of our organization from the get-go. Since I joined just under two years ago, we’ve evolved from a few initial research sessions to hundreds of sessions focused on multiple different features. We also run regular co-creation sessions and workshops with our users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team expands, researchers are now embedded in our pods. Syncing across these pods is becoming a challenge. We try to focus on our process and work collaboratively across pods to validate and challenge each others’ methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been difficult moments of transition. We went from sitting with developers and directly building things to a more formal product design framework with product managers on the team. One thing we did in the research and design team was to set aside a window of 2 - 4 hours on Mondays—which we called “Meta-Monday”—to work on core design things like our design system and other process stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Could you describe a recent user research project?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; We worked on a new feature that enabled users to group documents together based on structure and content. This was challenging because it started with the Machine Learning team that had developed the technology first and we had to evaluate how it could be used. It ended up teaching us a lot about users’ mental models for how they expect to understand an unsupervised learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our users are lawyers so we can’t actually compensate them for research as it’s considered bribing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We heard a lot of feedback from users saying they wanted more information about the algorithm. The reality we uncovered was that it wasn’t about the amount of information shown, but rather the need to feel like the users’ understood how the algorithm grouped things. It was an exercise in absorbing the complexity and presenting the clarity. This work required depth in synthesis and solidified our friendship with ambiguity, and was a great collaboration with our data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What software does Kira use? What have you tried in the past? What’s been working well?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; As an organization, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlassian.com/software/jira&quot;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of our design research team, we’ve been early adopters of &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/&quot;&gt;Realtimeboard (now Miro)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;, and we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://figma.com/&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://invision.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt;. Our frameworks and tool selection have been very fluid as our teams and needs grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to learn from academic research, especially when you work in a space that doesn’t have best practices developed such as the Machine Learning space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What challenges do you have with user research?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; Pleasantly, a lot of our research constraints are not due to a lack of design research interest within the organization, but are rather circumstantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is central to Kira due to the confidentiality that lawyers maintain with their clients, so we can’t actually implement any third-party testing tools anywhere in our app. We aren’t able to ever see our users working in their own instance, and everything that is user-inputted in our system is anonymized to us. This has forced our research approach to generally be creative; from using extrapolations and abstractions, to creating our own testing instance to test features in a live version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another constraint is with recruiting. Our users are lawyers so we can’t actually compensate them for research as it’s considered bribing! To overcome that, I’ve crafted personalized gifts (coasters, notebooks, etc…) with the help of a laser cutter at a makerspace. These have shaped the research experience with our respondents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more significant byproduct of this constraint was related to documentation. Since we can’t always have too much exposure with lawyers for research, we’ve had to think about how much of the research we can reuse when we do it. The return on investment of the research has helped us become strategic with our documentation. Tagging the data for a specific study versus for future research has played a more prominent role in this space, especially in the early phases of an upcoming feature. There is a trade-off between moving fast but starting from scratch, or moving a little slower but building on the previous research and that’s where we’ve used Dovetail to code the data in a way that allows us to shape our assumptions before launching studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s changing about user research at Kira Systems?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; Our research team was previously centralized. As the team expands, researchers are now embedded in our pods. Syncing across these pods is becoming a challenge. We try to focus on our process and work collaboratively across pods to validate and challenge each others’ methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why do you do what you do?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; A few years ago, I sketched an inverted pyramid divided into 3 horizontal segments to represent what I look for in a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and most significant part of it is the implication on my humanity. Does the work that I do expose me to healthy relationships that will challenge me to grow in my interpersonal relationships, emotional intelligence, patience, resilience, conflict resolution, and so on. I do believe that the most important part of what I take away from work ought to be the most transferable. It also feels like there is growth, even in moments when things are challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second layer has to do with the technical skills used and acquired. Skill stagnation scares me. Thankfully growing and learning in this category comes effortlessly when my mentors at Kira are people that care about the first part of the pyramid. The solidity of the relationships built also inspires me to push myself, and the team, in the second layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly and least significant to me is the industry that I work in. My curiosity and desire to learn and grow isn’t confined to the specific industry that I work in, although I tend to favor complex problems to solve. Working on an enterprise solution isn’t necessarily what designers or researchers would think of when they think of ‘sexy’ design challenges, but the ability to see features through from conceptualization to shipping is always exciting. These ideas have legs and giving them the room to grow in stages of ambiguity is hard in the moment, but always rewarding retrospectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice for new user researchers is to pursue the right kind of mentor that you can trust and is excited to ‘bet’ on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Any advice for new user researchers?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary:&lt;/i&gt; Curiosity led me here. My background is in documentary film but the frustration and limitation of the camera challenged me to seek solutions beyond the lens. I ended up doing a very practical program at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ciid.dk/&quot;&gt;Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design&lt;/a&gt; in Denmark, which was a great primer and anchored my desire to pursue research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice for new user researchers is to pursue the right kind of mentor that you can trust and is excited to ‘bet’ on you. Through that close working relationship and oversight of your work, they’ll be able to provide honest and applicable feedback that isn’t always necessarily what you want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The things that were hardest to hear were always the best pieces of advice that helped me become a sharper researcher, helping me become more critical to uncover all the ways I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, another piece of advice is to try and be collaborative with other types of researchers. Working with our data scientists has been incredibly enlightening, and ended up leading me to CHIIR this year, which was the best conference I had ever been to. There is a lot to learn from academic research, especially when you work in a space that doesn’t have best practices developed such as the Machine Learning space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interview with Erik Goyette, User Researcher at Shopify]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/interview-erik-goyette</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/interview-erik-goyette</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; is the world’s leading e-commerce platform with 800,000+ people from 175 countries using its platform as of 2018. Its ability to empower entrepreneurs and small businesses has pushed it to the forefront of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shopify’s design and research team has been growing steadily over the past few years. We spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/erapago&quot;&gt;Erik Goyette&lt;/a&gt;, and other members of the Shopify design and research team, to learn more about how they approach user research and design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s Shopify’s mission?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; Shopify is a commerce platform that helps entrepreneurs and businesses of any size design, set up, and manage commerce stores across multiple sales channels. We provide merchants with a powerful back-office and a single view of their business. Our mission is to make commerce better for everyone so that entrepreneurs around the world can easily start a business to sell online, through social media or in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How does user research work across Shopify?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; Shopify’s goal is to help small and large businesses become more successful, so making sure our product is easy to use is essential. We’re super passionate about understanding the problems our users have and building tools that will help them accomplish what they need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that maybe differentiates us from other businesses is that user research is directly embedded into teams. Being part of a team helps us researchers get a lot of deep context in a specific product area. On the other hand, researchers love discovering new things, so we also have the freedom to stray off the path and start digging into larger, more undefined problem spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Could you let us know about a recent user research project?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; I conducted a series of exploratory interviews and concept tests for my first project at Shopify, and thought to continue using my old method for sharing information: an atomic research database (Tomer Sharon explains the method best &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tsharon/foundations-of-atomic-research-a937d5da5fbb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where a presentation or a report &lt;i&gt;pushes&lt;/i&gt; insights to its audience, insights have to be &lt;i&gt;pulled out of&lt;/i&gt; atomic research. As a method of sharing research, it’s much more demanding on the people who need insights to inform their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed all of the interviews into a bunch of really interesting individual observations that were then grouped up into insights. As a researcher, I love this method because it serves as a very detailed, searchable, and well organized “second brain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as a method of sharing findings, it wasn’t very effective. The team had very specific questions to answer and though the answers were available, the atomic research format has a little more friction involved in finding them. Where a presentation or a report &lt;i&gt;pushes&lt;/i&gt; insights to its audience, insights have to be &lt;i&gt;pulled out of&lt;/i&gt; atomic research. As a method of sharing research, it’s much more demanding on the people who need insights to inform their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing the lack of engagement with the atomic research format, I went through and turned some of the more relevant insights into stories. Those stories were then included in a little presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories informed by data is very impactful at Shopify, so I’ll have to find out how to pair that with atomic research as a method. Ideally, atomic research doesn’t just exist as a hyper-detailed library of knowledge, but also as a driver for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What software does Shopify use? What have you tried in the past? What’s been working well?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/&quot;&gt;G Suite&lt;/a&gt; extensively. We try to use tools that the rest of the company also uses, so we can more easily collaborate and share resources. But we’re also lucky to have the freedom to use whatever we believe will get the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dovetail’s been great for our research team as well because if we’re ever curious about certain keywords or themes, we can search across multiple projects for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For interviews, we’ll often use &lt;a href=&quot;https://hangouts.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Hangouts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://lookback.io/&quot;&gt;Lookback&lt;/a&gt;. The nice thing about Google Hangouts is that participants don’t have to install anything, but it doesn’t work if you’re using Safari. Lookback is a fun one because it works on mobile and desktop. Notes you take are time-stamped to the recording, which is fantastic when reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To catalog our research, we’ve built a research library. Anyone across the company can go there to find our reports, slide decks, and recordings of our presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dovetailapp.com/&quot;&gt;Dovetail&lt;/a&gt;’s been great for our research team as well because if we’re ever curious about certain keywords or themes, we can search across multiple projects for them. With 50 researchers, there’s a lot of qualitative data available to remix and learn from. In a way, it’s become our second research library in addition to being our main tool for qualitative analysis (goodbye, spreadsheets!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What challenges do you have with user research?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; Before focusing on research, I was a UX specialist. I dabbled in designing the product (wireframes and interaction design patterns) in addition to running research initiatives. When designing, I received a lot of feedback on my work that helped me re-assess my approach. Moving to a role where my focus is now entirely user research, I’ve been reflecting on how I receive feedback and how I measure the success of my research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… you can feel a sense of satisfaction when something you have uncovered becomes a team’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I compare research to the design and engineering disciplines, where there are very clearly defined opportunities for feedback from team members, the feedback cycle for a researcher is less structured and less frequent. We’ll get eyes on our research plan. If we’re lucky, or ask for it, we’ll get some feedback on how the research findings were presented. Questions about whether or not we could have shared the information in a better, clearer, or more memorable way are rare. Feedback on how the analysis was performed? That’s a black box for most people, and it takes a long time for even a talented researcher to understand someone else’s analysis, so the lack of feedback there is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’re often left with as feedback on how we’re performing is the impact of our research. If the research leads to a project (which isn’t always the case) it can be a difficult thing to measure because of the long stretch of time that user research lives at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a researcher, you could be conducting exploratory research on a project that won’t be prioritized until a roadmap planning meeting many months in the future. Leading up to that meeting, you could try measuring the impact of your work by paying attention to how people think about a problem. At the very least, you can feel a sense of satisfaction when something you have uncovered becomes a team’s focus. It isn’t necessarily something you use to improve on your work and methodology in the future, but it’s nice to know that there was alignment on a goal and user research played a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s changing about user research at Shopify?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; As Shopify expands into new markets, we’re exploring how researchers who have a deep understanding of a product area can approach international research. Localization of content is one thing, but we also have to consider how business processes and expectations may be different in each of the countries we support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been checking in on how our knowledge management solutions are performing. In an effort to be more resourceful, we’re going to make sure existing user research is organized and formatted in a way that can be consumed and understood by other teams. Some research is almost timeless and will always be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why do you do what you do?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; I am absolutely in love with Shopify’s users. They’re driven, they’re smart, and they’re a wonderfully diverse group of people. Seeing someone gain independence by turning their passion into a business is so inspiring. Every day I wake up wanting to better understand how they work, what their challenges are, and uncover opportunities for us to help them reach their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Any advice for new user researchers?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik:&lt;/b&gt; If you’re new to the industry or are thinking of turning user research into a career, my biggest hope is that you already have some of the foundational stuff down. The most important thing you’ll need starting off is the ability to think critically about the projects you’re working on, the questions people are asking, and your own work. You have to be able to zoom in, fuss over the details, and then zoom out to see the whole picture at a high level. If you have that down, you’ll be in a really good place to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes afterward is getting experience and growing your skillset. You don’t need to have first-hand experience running card sorts, usability tests, interviews, surveys or a dozen workshops under your belt. You’ll learn that as you go, and improve over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, it’s important to find an environment that’ll allow you to try out a bunch of research methods. For me, that environment was working at start-ups. Start-ups move at a rapid pace, and people will tend to run off and build while still holding some risky assumptions (with the best intentions). If you can find yourself in a place like that, equipped with your research mindset, you can experience a lot of growth and have a lot of influence. The skill you’ll have is the ability to test assumptions before anyone has to invest hundreds of hours into building something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid pace also means projects might wrap up relatively quickly, giving you the opportunity to learn from the launch, find the gaps, learn from them, and experiment with your research methods next time. If you’re resourceful and can handle the pace of the work, you’ll expand your skillset dramatically in a very short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learning to collaborate and improvise]]></title><link>https://dovetail.com/outlier/learning-to-collaborate-and-improvise</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dovetail.com/outlier/learning-to-collaborate-and-improvise</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) that &lt;u&gt;those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
